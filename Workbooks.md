1. Study the information in this workbook.

**Text**

**Introduction**

This text focuses on air-to-air employment at low altitude, specifically F-15-only formations in autonomous low-level operations.

**Formation Considerations**

*Line Abreast*

Similar to medium altitude, but terrain, visual maintenance, and surface-to-air threats increase task loading.  Wingman spacing is flexible (4000-12,000 feet).  Closer spacing aids visual contact in challenging conditions, while wider spacing reduces threat acquisition.  Exceeding 12,000 feet hinders visual and maneuvering. Spacing below 4000 feet increases adversary acquisition, complicates turns, and hinders defensive reactions.  Tactical airspeeds (450-500 KCAS) must adapt to terrain; avoid speeds below 350 KCAS.

*Trail or Wedge*

Used as a last resort for very low altitudes or maneuvering over rough terrain. Flown 30-70° aft of lead, at 4000-9000 feet.  Loss of two-ship visual mutual support increases risk to trailing aircraft due to predictability and ground/airborne threat awareness.

*Airspeed*

Quicker throttle response at low altitudes. 450-500 KCAS ideal for maneuvering.  Higher speeds (500-600 KCAS) for threat avoidance, but poorer deceleration. Deceleration best below 450 KCAS. Turn radius increases significantly above 500 KCAS; full speed brake below 450 KCAS. External store limits matter on SA-1.

*Turns (Line Abreast)*

Com-out turns signaled by wing flash (like medium/high altitude, no vertical).  Coordination vital due to wingman’s ground crosscheck.  Alternative: check turns. Leader's 30° turn signals wingman’s 90° turn. Leader completes turn as wingman passes 6 o'clock. For turns into wingman, leader makes single turn, wingman checks 30° away, completing when lead passes 6 o'clock. Tighter turns at low altitude; less planform highlighting.  Avoid jet wash; cross above or at 90° with minimal loading.  Reduced lateral spacing in rough terrain.  Terrain emphasis in cross-check, balancing formation, avoidance, and deconfliction. Turn initiation can be WSO's call.

*Crew Coordination*

Essential for mission success.  Tailor to experience, mission, positions, and skill levels. Avoid constant communication.

*Terrain Avoidance*

Pilot's primary responsibility, aided by WSO's SA calls from E-scope/TSD.  Cross-check HUD velocity vector every 3-5 seconds, especially during turns.

*Visual/Formation Position*

Shared responsibility. WSO gives advisory/turn calls due to pilot's forward focus. Pilot cross-checks position.  "Heads down/up" and "outside/inside" calls (by exception).

*Turns*

Pilot: select auto guns turn direction (watch for locking lead).  WSO: check old/new 6 o’clock based on turn order. Advise pilot on turn timing relative to lead.  Smoothly transition to standard lookout and WSO radar control during rollout.

*Systems Operation*

Pre-mission air-to-air decisions essential.  WSO handles complex radar if proficient.  Optimize aircraft performance, visual lookout, and ALE-45 at merge.  BFM (Basic Fighter Maneuvers) paramount. Jettison stores if slow and defensive. In BFM, WSO monitors wingman and clears six. Coordinate countermeasures. Basic fight principles are key, demanding conservative, controlled employment.

*Radar Set-Up*

APG-70 gains down at low altitude, increasing target detection threshold. High Pulse Repetition Frequency (HPRF) gives power advantage for long-range detection (high aspect). Interleaved search best for combining long-range (hot) and short-range (cold) target detection.

*Consider other radar setup techniques at low altitude:*
* *Frame store (FS):* Wingmen should consider FS2 vs FS1 for better track file management while performing other tasks.
* *Range scale:* 40 or 80 nm scope to maximize APG-70 long range capability.
* *Sweep scan:* 120° sweep initially for maximum detection, then 60° to sort after targets identified.


*Radar Search Plan*

Wingman on high search, lead on low. 2000 feet search overlap at acquisition symbol set range (usually 20 nm, terrain dependent).  Poor detection over terrain masking. Avoid turn points after ridge crossings.  In four-ship formations, split high/low between element leads or wingmen depending on experience and threat type.  Element lead high search aids air-to-air targeting with total communication. Wingman high search lets wingman see radar picture discussed on radio.  Leads splitting search has disadvantage of more difficult search for one wingman.

*Visual Lookout*

Disciplined search pattern.  Search entire field of view, emphasizing briefed area. Formation dictates area, and moving aircraft to check blind spots.  Don't focus only on horizontal plane. Search vertical also.  Start at gun range and move outward.  Use check turns, 3-5Gs, to clear 6 o’clock but realize presenting planform may provide enemy tally.  Prioritize 6 o’clock, then wingman area, then forward hemisphere. Check outside prior to restarting search.

*HUD Use*

Excellent for situational awareness at low altitude, but cross-check with ground as priority. Velocity vector for level flight reference after starting and during a turn.

*Low Altitude Intercepts*

Ground/terrain awareness is highest priority. Timing of maneuvers adjusted for smaller turn circles at low altitude: 15AA at 8 nm (vs 15 nm), 14AA at 7 nm (vs 10 nm), 13AA at 6 nm (vs 10 nm). Hotter intercepts possible. Airspeed best gained in afterburner, sustained in military power.

Low-to-high: Chandelle maneuver to low 6 o'clock, never leaving blind zone.  Terrain avoidance less of a concern. Avoid squaring the corner (overshoot better); 2000 feet AGL can be deceiving.

High-to-low: Use early, aggressive turns. End slightly higher than target.  Discontinue pure pursuit to preserve vertical room. Maintain vertical separation, tracking target's LOS.  Gain closure and firing position while monitoring ground and target.

Co-altitude: Terrain masking and dead reckoning are problems. TSD assists prediction. Radar works over flat terrain.  Weapons employment more difficult. Adjust pursuit curves for target speed.

Common Errors:
* Intercepting shadow
* No tally before radar break lock
* Excessive airspeed
* Late conversion

Conversion Aborts: Avoid pure high-to-low split-S.  Limit rolls to 135°. Recover if unsafe.

High/low speed targets: Colder intercept for faster targets. Monitor closure and aspect for slow targets.


*Weapons Selection*

Reduced envelopes at low altitude due to kinematics and seeker clutter.  Missile ground impact a consideration. Nose-high attitude reduces ground impact.

AIM-120: First shot opportunity. Off-boresight, all-aspect BVR. Active seeker allows launch aircraft to maneuver after shot.

AIM-7: Must meet seeker and ground clearance requirements.  Maintain LOS with target.

AIM-9: Retains all-aspect but reduced range. Verify seeker track (visual/aural).

Gun: Control range, lead, and plane-of-motion (POM).  POM critical at low altitude.

*Contingencies*
No Radar/Bad Systems: Sick-radar aircraft becomes wingman; other aircraft becomes lead. Radar aircraft expects support, visually tied to lead. Good radar aircraft provides information. Avoidance best if possible. Group Targeting/Sorting: Maintain disciplines, but reduce ranges due to weapon envelopes. Finish group targeting by 20-25 nm, element sorting by 15 nm. Short Range Radar Contact/Commit: Maneuver, call “engaged,” launch if able, acquire tally, communicate to flight. Wingman supports.  Element Targeted/Threat Reactions: No radar contact: put RWR spike on beam. Trading shots: use missile range, shot doctrine, and F-pole maneuvers. Notching: 12-10 nm, beam maneuver, idle power break, IRMD. Stern Threat: Afterburner, “float” (20-30° check turn, diverging). Bandit trails: turning entry to wingman. Bandit between: mini-pince at 4 nm separation. Other Contingencies: lost contacts, blind wingman, low fuel, battle damage, F-15 losses, abort criteria, winchester missiles, ALE-45, surface-to-air threat.

**Text**

**Basic Aerodynamics**

*Aerodynamic forces acting on aircraft:*
* Lift
* Weight
* Drag
* Thrust

*Lift*

Perpendicular to relative wind. L = ½ air density x velocity² x coefficient of lift x wing surface area. Controllable factors: air density (altitude), true airspeed, and coefficient of lift (angle of attack/G capability). Wing design/shape (camber and planform) affect lift. Camber is changed with flaps (not usually for maneuvers).  Swept wings generate less maximum lift than straight wings, but maintain lift at higher angles of attack. 30 units AOA is near C\_{LMAX}.

*Weight*

Force of gravity, always acts towards Earth. Opposes lift in level flight, opposes thrust/drag in vertical flight.

*Drag*

Resists movement. Opposes thrust.  Three sources: induced (from lift, worse at high AOA/low speed), parasite (from aircraft profile/stores), and wave (from transonic speeds). Minimize wave drag with swept wings (~45° on F-15E). Controllable drag factors: air density, true airspeed, lift coefficient, and aircraft configuration.  Coefficient of drag (C\_{D}) increases with AOA. Minimum drag/best acceleration at 8-10 units AOA.

*Thrust*

Propels forward.  T = M(V₂ - V₁), where M = mass; V₂ = exit velocity; V₁ = intake velocity. Controllable factors: air density, true airspeed, and throttle.

*Questions and Answers*
1. Label aerodynamic forces. *(Answer: Lift, Weight, Drag, Thrust)*
2. Controllable thrust factors. *(Answer: Air density, True airspeed, Throttle setting)*
3. Controllable drag factors. *(Answer: Air density, True airspeed, Lift coefficient, Aircraft configuration)*
4. Controllable lift factors. *(Answer: Air density, True airspeed, Lift coefficient)*
5. Lift acts perpendicular to relative wind. *(Answer: True)*
6. Weight always opposes lift. *(Answer: False)*

*Stability*

*Longitudinal Stability (Pitch)*
* Aerodynamic center (AC): Point where lift changes occur.
* Center of gravity (CG): Point where weight changes occur.
* Positive longitudinal stability: Aircraft returns to trimmed AOA after disturbance.
* CG must be ahead of AC for positive stability.

*F-15E Specifics*

* Horizontal stabilator provides nose-up moment.
* CG movement affects handling.  Less stable with aft CG (aft CFTs and stores).
* Supersonic flight moves AC aft, increasing stability.

*Lateral/Directional Stability*

* Lateral (Roll): Primarily depends on wing geometry. F-15E slightly positive. Stores increase lateral stability (except LANTIRN/centerline tank).
* Directional (Yaw): Influenced by vertical tails. F-15E positive. Stores destabilize, especially forward stores (LANTIRN).

*Questions and Answers*

1. External stores generally . roll, and the aircraft in pitch and yaw.  *(Answer: stabilize, destabilize)*
2. Longitudinal stability depends on . *(Answer: aerodynamic center and center of gravity)*

*Turn Performance*

* *Sustained Corner Velocity:* Speed for maximum sustained turn rate at given power.
* *Sustained Turn:* Turn without losing speed/altitude at given power.
* *Structural Limits:* Maximum airspeed/G before damage.

*Limits to Turn Performance*

* *Lift Obtainable:* Controllable by pilot. C\_{LMAX} limits flight envelope.  Altitude dependent.
* *G Permissible:* Aircraft design limit or imposed limit. Decreases at higher airspeeds.
* *Thrust Available:* Determines sustainable G and maximum speed.

*Turn Performance Measurements*
* *Turn Rate (degrees/second):* Depends on true airspeed and radial G.
* *Turn Radius (feet):* Depends on true airspeed and radial G.

*Radial G and the "Egg"*

Radial G (acceleration towards turn center) depends on lift vector position. Below horizon increases turning performance, above horizon decreases it. "Tactical egg" formed by constant G loop.

8. Turn radius depends on . *(Answer: true airspeed, radial G)*
9. Same airspeed/radial G =  turn radii. *(Answer: equal)*

*Performance Management*

*Energy Maneuverability (EM) Diagram*

Constant P\_{s} (specific power) lines show energy states. Indicates:
* *Sustainable Envelope:* P\_{s} = 0 line.
* *Sustained Corner Velocity:* Lowest speed for max sustainable G.
* *Best Energy Rate at Max G:* Tangent point of P\_{s} line and max G line.

Specific power measures ability to change energy. P\_{s} > 0: climb/accelerate/increase G without loss. P\_{s} < 0: must descend/decelerate/reduce G. P\_{s} = 0: balanced.

*Corner Velocity*

Highest turn rate/smallest radius. Full aft stick without over-G. Instantaneous turn. Optimize by aligning lift/weight vectors (oblique loops).

*Sustained Corner Velocity*

Max sustainable G at lowest speed. Usually less turn rate/larger radius.  Compute for best sustained turn.

*Maneuvering*

*Above corner velocity:* Max G, idle thrust, speedbrake (to 500 KCAS), then full AB at corner velocity.

*Below corner velocity:* Full AB, C\_{LMAX} (30 units AOA), then minimum drag AOA (8-10 units/ ~1G) for acceleration. Optimum turn at 16-22 units AOA.

*Before Class*

1. Study workbook and complete quiz.
2. Read reference material.

**Text**

**Definitions/Terms**

*Intercept:* Maneuver from beyond visual range to employ ordnance, identify, or enter visual fight. Can use GCI/AWACS, onboard radar, or both.

*Heading Crossing Angle (HCA):* Angle between projected flight paths. Maximum 180° (head-on). Depends on both headings.

*Aspect Angle (AA):* Angle from target tail to fighter LOS. Independent of fighter heading. Maximum 180° (H), minimum 0° (T). Determines quadrant.

*Antenna Train Angle (ATA):* Angle from fighter nose to radar LOS.  Where radar is looking. Limited by radar.

*Collision Antenna Train Angle (CATA):* ATA for collision course. Maintain constant LOS. Changes with target/fighter speed/heading.  Quickest intercept. Determined by: CATA = 180° - AA. Fly CATA by offsetting target from center of radar display.

*Hot/Cold:* Areas of radar display. Hot increases AA, cold decreases AA. CATA divides hot/cold.

*Target Drift:* Change in scope azimuth when target not on CATA. Rules: (1) CATA tracks straight. (2) Non-CATA targets drift from CATA. (3) Steepest track near CATA. (4) Nose targets drift cold (except H aspect).

*Pursuit Types:*

* *Pure:* Fighter nose on target.  Quickest kill.
* *Lead:* Fighter nose ahead of target. To gain closure or increase AA.
* *Lag:* Fighter nose behind target. To reduce closure or decrease AA.

*Closure (Vc):* Angular velocity between aircraft.  Changes with aspect.

**Medium Altitude Intercepts**

*Intercept Types*

* Cut-off/Collision course (quickest).
* Stern conversion (restrictions/identification).
* Front MRM with stern reattack.

*Approach Quadrants*

* Head-on (16-H)
* Front quarter (12-15)
* Beam (7-11)
* Stern (T-6)

*Cut-off/Collision Course Intercept*

Quickest. 180° - AA = CATA. Turn to CATA for constant AA and azimuth.

*Stern Conversions*

To gain turning room.  Types: horizontal, combination, and vertical.

*Horizontal*
 Easier, turning room as displayed, easier to see/defeat. Requires large turn radius (8-10 nm).
* *Head-on (16-H):* Offset 40-50° cold, counterturn, pure pursuit at 15AA/20nm, 14AA/15nm, 13AA/10nm.
* *Front Quarter (12-15):* CATA to pure pursuit curve (e.g., 14R at 35nm, CATA 40L, pure pursuit at 15 nm).
* *Beam (7-11):* +200 knots, 50-55° hot, counter-turn, pure pursuit at 5-10 nm.
* *Stern (T-6):* Similar to beam, less displacement (72 AA hot), pure pursuit at 3-5 nm.


*Conversion Pursuit Guide*

Shows turning room. 16AA at 30nm: sufficient.  Reference points: 16/30, 15/20, 14/15, 13/10-12.

*Pure Pursuit Conversion Turn*

Reference points for rollout (range/aspect/Vc): 7/12/800-900, 6/10/700-800, 5/9/600-700, 4/7/500-600, 3/5/400-500, 2/2/200-300, 1/T/100.

*Combination*

Combines horizontal and vertical (chandelle/slice).  Harder to see/counter. Difficult at night/IMC. Vertical turning room (5000-10,000 ft).  Pursuit guide: 17/40, 16/20, 15/15, 14/10.  Head-on similar to horizontal, add vertical.

*Vertical*

Low/high. Hard to see. High attack = max energy; low attack masks radar. Difficult high-low tally, potential square corner (high-low), energy loss (low-high).  >10,000 ft vertical, early tally (8-10 nm), pure pursuit at 30° antenna elevation/depression.

*Medium Altitude Intercept Summary*

Types: cut-off and stern conversion. Stern conversion types: horizontal, combination, vertical.  Parameters vary with experience.

*Intercept Flow*

Steps: Radar setup/search, Find/lock, BRA call, 3D view, Intercept geometry, Maneuver (turning room, collision course, altitude, airspeed), Endgame.

*Radar Setup/Search*

Tailor to situation. Range: cover threat range. Elevation: cover altitude band. Azimuth: cover airspace. Acquisition symbols: lead target range. Altitude coverage: search expected altitudes. Have a plan.

*Find Target/Lock On*

Two hits before lock-on. Use mini-raster by leading target or positioning symbol over target. Avoid locking on in a turn.

*BRA(A) Call*

Bearing (magnetic/relative), Range, Altitude, (Aspect). Example: "Jester 21, group, one five zero, twenty, twenty-one thousand, flanking north."

*Develop Three-Dimensional View*

Interpret radar to understand geometry. Objectives: collision course or turning room.  Visualize "God's Eye" view (TSD helpful).

*Determine Intercept Geometry*

Do what's required. Consider factors. Accomplish early. Go pure pursuit by 10 nm. Get early tally. Endgame: MRM or stern conversion.

*Maneuver to Make Adjustments to Intercept*

*Turning Room:* Maneuver point-to-point for 10 nm horizontal offset (pure pursuit curve).  Vertical helps (slice/chandelle). Hot intercepts require higher endgame G.

*Airspeed:* Rollout with positive overtake. Speed at "go pure" point relative to target KTAS.  Fast target (>M1.1): offset early, lateral room, match speed, pure at 14-15AA. Slow target: offset normal/late, look-up, reacquire, go pure inside 10 nm.

*Vc Control:* Cross-check range/Vc. High Vc: lag. Low Vc: lead. Modulate power.

*Typical Intercept:* Search (80nm, 4/6 bar, 120° sweep, frame store 1), Detect (azimuth bump 30°/60°), Sample (STT/TWS/Highlight, 5 sec locks), Targeting (lead determines group), Sanitize (wide search between samples), Sorting (final lock, briefed, wingman takes his side/trailers), Intercept Geometry (cutoff/stern conversion), Intercept Results (attack undetected, neutral start, fighter defensive, missed), Separate (egress, guns, sanitize, rejoin, A/A).

*High Altitude Intercepts*

Climb to FL350, 1.3M, H aspect. At Raero, center dot, shoot two missiles. At 15 miles, bunt. Illuminate target.

*Low Altitude Intercepts*

Reduced acquisition range, reduced missile envelopes, gun difficult.  Fly horizontal/limited vertical. Gradual descent, maintain speed advantage, early tally essential.

*Crew Coordination*

*Radar:* WSO primary at low altitude, pilot in short range. Otherwise flexible. Non-controlling crew member clears and monitors flight.

*Commentary:* Brief intercockpit keywords.  Intraflight: minimal essential communication. GCI/AWACS: use brevity code.

*Visual Lookout:* Both crew members. Clear immediate threat, search high/low, be disciplined. Belly checks.
