AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_10.jpeg:
Loss of two-ship visual mutual support significantly increases the threat
to the trailing aircraft. Since the flight is confined to a predictable flight
path, ground threats are forewarned when the lead aircraft passes by,
expecting the wingman to pass the same area. Airborne threats are able
to attack the trailing aircraft and remain unseen by the leader. In low
threat areas, wedge is a good option for flexibility of employment and ease
of maneuver. While flying wedge formation, tactical airspeeds must be
adapted to terrain. In other words, 450-500 knots (KCAS) may be too fast
when flying over rough mountainous terrain. Do not get slower than 350
(KCAS)! This gives a small turn radius and an acceptable turn rate while
maintaining the ability to abort the route vertically, if necessary.
However, close attention is required to avoid airspeed bleed-off during
repeated maneuvering.

Airspeed

Airspeed response to throttle adjustments is quicker at low altitudes than
at medium/high altitude. In standard tactical formation, 450-500 KCAS is
probably the best operating airspeed to provide offensive and defensive
maneuvering potential. If the goal is to avoid the threat, consider higher
speed (500-600 KCAS). Realize however, that aircraft deceleration is poor
above 500 KCAS, is better from 500-450 KCAS, and is excellent below 450
KCAS. At airspeeds above 500 KCAS, turn radius increases significantly
and speed brake extension is minimal, due to air loads. Full speed brake
extension is available below 450 KCAS. The low altitude step down
training (LASDT) acceleration/deceleration (ACCEL/DECEL) maneuver
will emphatically demonstrate this. On SA-1, carriage, employment and
jettison limits for external stores become a concern. The bottom line is
this: while “speed is life” continues to be a means for survival in a high
threat area, slowing down to a better maneuvering airspeed to counter a
threat requires quick response and close monitoring of aircraft
parameters.

Turns (Line Abreast)

Low altitude, comm-out turns may be signaled by a wing flash and
accomplished similarly to medium/high altitude turns (without vertical
maneuvering). At low altitude, however, the wingman must spend a lot of
time crosschecking ground clearance and may miss wing flashes from the
leader. This particular problem can be minimized by well coordinated
crew lookout responsibilities.

A second method of turning a flight uses a combination of check turns to
initiate and control the turns; wing flashes are not used. To turn away
from the wingman, the leader abruptly turns 30° and then rolls out. The
wingman recognizes this as a turn command and immediately initiates a
90° toward the leader. As the wingman passes through his 6 o’clock
position, the leader completes the turn he has started (Figure D-8).

Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_12.jpeg:
A turn into the wingman is accomplished the same way, except that the
leader rolls into the turn and completes it in one maneuver. The
wingman, upon seeing lead turning toward him, check turns 30° away
from lead. The wingman completes his turn (using visual references)
when lead passes through his 6 o’clock (Figure D-4).

Figure D - 4. Turn into the Wingman.

Remember aircraft response and energy sustainability is better at low
altitude; so, tighter radius turns are normally flown. Thus, less time is
required to complete the turn, and aircraft planforms are not highlighted
as long. Also, the second aircraft to turn must wait longer than at
medium/high altitude before initiating the turn.

With the aircraft under high Gs, flying through jet wash may result in an
over-G and/or control problems. It is best to cross above jet wash rather
than through it. If jet wash cannot be avoided, passing through it as close
to 90° as possible with minimum aircraft loading minimizes the effects.

AAM-10 D-6


Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_13.jpeg:
In rough terrain, reduced lateral spacing may be necessary to prevent loss
of visual. The aircrew must remain aware of the proximity of the ground
and the lack of vertical turning room available below the aircraft.

The pilot must make terrain the major emphasis in his cross check,
devoting every other look-out to it, while adjusting formation position and
altitude. The pilot must allow enough cross-check time to adequately
accomplish the following required tasks: formation, avoid the terrain and
deconflict flight paths (especially during turns). Timing of turn initiation
may also be the WSO’s call. Either of the two procedures described may
be used. The wingflash option allows for a single maneuver by element
members and is not constrained to set angular moves. The 30° check turn
option allows the flight leader to better control/monitor the flight.
Advantages and disadvantages of both procedures can be adapted to flight
experience and tactical necessity.

CREW COORDINATION

Because the F-15E is a “crew aircraft,” crew coordination often spells
success or failure of the mission. Crew coordination does not mean
constant intercockpit communication/discussion; that simply fills a
comm-jam square. On the other hand, crew coordination is not just “you
do your job, and I'll do mine.” At low altitude, it is imperative that both
crewmembers understand how mission priorities affect the task
loading/management of each crew member. In this way, tasks can be
better shared making the overall task management much easier. Crew
coordination must not be “blown off” but rather, must be tailored to the
experience of each pilot/WSO, the mission, flight positions and personal
skill levels.

D-7 AAM-10


Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_14.jpeg:
Terrain Avoidance

Terrain avoidance is obviously the number one priority of the crew while
employing at low altitude. Avoiding the rocks is the primary
responsibility of the pilot, but the WSO can assist with S.A. on terrain
awareness through advisory calls of upcoming terrain on the E-scope or
TSD. Crosscheck of the velocity vector in the HUD every 3-5 seconds at
low altitude should assure terrain clearance. While turning, this
crosscheck becomes vitally important. AGD-1 presents specific procedures
and factors to apply for best low altitude parameters and maneuvers.

Visual/Formation Position

This responsibility is really a shared item. It can normally be conducted
while working the visual lookout priorities already discussed. The WSO
must realize the pilot spends a great amount of attention looking forward
at the rocks, so he/she should give formation advisory/turn calls to the
pilot. The pilot must also crosscheck his formation position at a rate
sufficient to maintain the best position possible. In this way, visual
signals will not be missed and reactions to check turns or airspeed
changes will be quicker than if called exclusively by the WSO.

To coordinate actions, the pilot/(WSO should stipulate whether they are
“heads down” or “up,” and whether looking “outside” or “inside” the
formation. These calls can be further coordinated to be “by exception,”
meaning it is assumed the other person is visually looking outside the
aircraft, unless specifically stated he/she is “heads down.”

Turns

While turning at low altitude, the pilot may wish to select auto guns into
the direction of the turn. (Be aware of the chance it could lock the flight
lead.) Additionally, the pilot should have only momentary visual lookout
responsibilities while mainly avoiding the ground. The WSO should be
checking the flight's old 6 o’clock position if they are the first to turn. If
turning second, check the flight’s new 6 o’clock position. Additionally, the
WSO can advise the pilot on timing of this turn in relation to lead. During
roll out of the turn, transition smoothly to standard visual lookout and
WSO control of the radar.

AAM-10 D-8


Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_15.jpeg:
Systems Operation

Before the flight even starts, individual crews must make certain
air-to-air tactical decisions. Which crewmember runs the air-to-air radar,
how and when to transition control, and personal techniques and
procedures must be thoroughly understood by the pilot and WSO. Actual
war is no time for personal feelings or ego to preclude effective mission
accomplishment. If the WSO is more adept at working complex radar
targeting problems, then he/she should be running it. However, if the
reverse is true, have a plan to “hand-off” the affected systems to the WSO
when formation or low altitude responsibilities preclude maximum
effective use of the system by the pilot. Use peacetime training to teach
each other best employment options—not combat.

After doing all this work and preparation for the air-to-air fight, do not
forget the basics at the merge. If jets start turning and BFM is required,
optimize the aircraft’s performance, the crew’s visual lookout and aircraft
systems such as the ALE-45. Correct BFM is paramount. If not
configured for an air-to-air mission, air-to-ground munitions on the jet
reduce maneuvering limits to 6.0-6.5 symmetrical G and 3.0-4.8 G
asymmetrical. Consider jettisoning tanks and/or bombs if getting slow
(<350-400 KCAS) and defensive. If offensive in a BFM fight, the WSO
should be monitoring the wingman, checking his six, and searching for
others trying to enter the fight. Additionally, the crew must coordinate
the dispensing of chaff and flares or they may risk dumping twice the
desired amount or dumping none.

The bottom line to low altitude air-to-air employment is that basic fight
principles must be understood and adhered to more strictly. Variations in
aircraft performance and proximity to the ground force the aircrew to a
more conservative and controlled employment in this arena if they want to
get the job done well.

EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
Radar Set-Up

Use of the APG-70 at low altitude carries with it special considerations,
just as low altitude formation does. Detailed discussion is classified, but
certain basic facts about APG-70 operation at low altitude may be
addressed. Remember that at low altitude, the 044 Digital Radar Signal
Processor (DRSP) automatically gains down the radar detection capability
in relation to signal-to-noise ratio in an effort to filter out sidelobe
feedback and background noise. In essence, to avoid “seeing” noise coming
into the antenna, the radar increases the target detection threshold; thus,
a much stronger target return is required at low altitude. To get a
stronger return, a powerful signal must be transmitted through the main
lobe. Average peak power is highest in high pulse repetition frequency
(HPRF). In fact, the power advantage over medium PRF (MPRF) is quite
significant. HPRF must be utilized to achieve long range detection.

Selecting HPRF-only displays only high aspect targets. At 30+ miles this
may be fine, but bandits in the beam or tail aspect within 20 miles go
undetected with HPRF-only search. Only medium PRF detects these
bandits. For targets within 20 nm, signal-to-noise ratio for radar hits is
sufficiently strong in MPRF. So, the bottom line is use interleaved search
at low altitude to give both long range detection of hot targets and short
range detection of cold targets.

AAM-10 D-10


Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_17.jpeg:
Consider these other radar setup techniques at low altitude:

e Frame store (FS): Wingmen should consider FS2 vs FS1. Track
files will build and still be on the scope while crosschecking other
low altitude priorities (watching the rocks, maintaining formation,
visual lookout, threat avoidance, etc.).

e Range scale: 40 or 80 nm scope. The APG-70 has excellent long
range capability. Use the long range search capability to provide
the option to work avoidance criteria or commit criteria as early as
possible. Remember, the job is to put ordnance on target and
survive while doing it. Early adversary detection will greatly
enhance this goal.

e Sweep scan: For maximum detection, a 120° sweep should initially
be selected. Once groups have been targeted, a 60° sweep may aid
in sorting.

Radar Search Plan

In two-ship formations, consider giving the wingman the high search
responsibility. Remember, the wingman has other priorities such as
formation responsibilities. The radar hits at medium/high altitude occur
farther out, do not hide in ground clutter, and maintain track files better
than low altitude contacts. The lead will then have the more difficult
avionics work, which should match his time availability/capability. Have
at least 2000 feet of search overlap at briefed acquisition symbol set
range. Twenty nautical miles is normally briefed, but terrain features
must be considered. If the planned route is over terrain that permits
terrain masking, then it is also lousy for detection of low altitude bandits
hiding behind ridges. Since visual lookout is more of a challenge during
turns, do not plan turn points immediately after a ridge crossing. The low
altitude radar search will not see the bandits on the other side. This
should be considered in premission planning.

D-11 AAM-10


Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_18.jpeg:
Four-ship formations also need to divide the high/low radar search
responsibilities. There are two techniques for this: splitting high/low
search between the element leads (1-low, 2-high, 3-high, 4-low); or,
splitting it between the wingmen (1-low, 2-high, 3-low, 4-high).
Advantages to the leads splitting search are:

e Air-to-air targeting gives total picture between the element
communication.

e A wingman in each element “sees” the radar picture that the other
element is talking about on the radio.

A major disadvantage is that one of the wingmen is now responsible for
the more difficult radar search (#4 in this example). This has already
been identified as not optimum for wingman task loading. Advantages
and disadvantages of splitting search plans between the wingmen are the
opposite of the other technique. What works for a four-ship will be based
largely on wingman experience and ability, and expected adversary
ability/weaponry. For example, experienced wingmen are able to handle a
low altitude search reliably. If the threat is medium/high BVR shooters,
having an element lead with a high search becomes a big plus. Ifthe
threat is from an IR missile equipped bandit at low altitude, then both
leads should have low altitude search responsibility.

Visual Lookout

Clearing for air-to-air threats is one of the major tasks that occupy the
time of the F-15E aircrew. Paramount to survival and tactical
employment is developing a disciplined search pattern that is logical and
easy to gain proficiency in. Each crew must search the entire field of view
(FOV) around their aircraft with special emphasis on the briefed areas of
responsibility. The particular formation dictates the areas of
responsibility, including moving the aircraft to search blind spots (Figures
D-5 and D-6).

Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_21.jpeg:
Do not concentrate lookout solely in the vicinity of the horizontal plane of
the formation. When searching a particular sector around the formation,
start level with the horizon; then, gradually move your search to the
extreme vertical above. While searching, begin at gun range (the most
immediate threat) and move outward to missile range. Try to focus on a
point on the horizon and look for movement. To check blind zones, using
check turns may enhance visual lookout at 6 o’clock. However, there is a
risk encountered when constantly presenting the aircraft planform
against the horizon, possibly giving an early tally to the enemy. A

30° turn using 3-5 Gs allows a check of 6 o'clock with minimal effect to
routing.

The flight’s area of responsibility for visual lookout should be prioritized
for survival. A good search of the flight's 6 o’clock is the first priority.
Next, move your scan through the wingman as discussed above. Visual
lookout to the forward hemisphere is necessary, but disciplined work with
the APG-70 should limit the amount of time you spend there. More
importantly, check outside of the formation prior to starting the search
pattern again. Although each wingman will be clearing through and
across the flight, the best chance of detecting threats outside the
formation is by the wingman on that side; this is due to the long distances
involved (lateral spacing of the formation plus the range of the threat).

HUD Use

Use of the HUD in the low altitude tactical arena is an excellent way to
maintain situational awareness of your parameters while still
maintaining “head-out” (a must when flying close to the ground). But, like
all instruments, it must be used as part of a cross-check, with the ground
the most important element of the check. Use of the velocity vector
provides a good level flight reference after initially rolling into a turn and
at timely intervals, throughout a turn.

Low Altitude Intercepts

General Considerations

As with all low altitude operations, awareness of the ground/terrain must
be the highest priority in the attacker’s crosscheck. Some specific
adjustments must be made for this factor.

Timing of maneuvers used in low/medium altitude intercepts is affected
by the smaller turn circles, which result from the greater air density at
these altitudes. Consequently, pure pursuit curve numbers change from:

15AA at 15 nm to 15AA at 8 nm
14AA at 10 nm to 14AA at 7 nm
13AA at 10 nm to 13AA at 6 nm

A much hotter intercept can be run at low altitude. Aspect angles and
pursuit curves must be adjusted for the relative speed of the bogey. Fuel
flow is greatly increased. Full afterburner can burn fuel at a greater rate
than the feed tanks can be replenished. A good rule-of-thumb is to get
airspeed in afterburner, and sustain it in military power.

Low-to-High Intercepts

Low-to-high conversions require evaluation of both vertical and horizontal
maneuvering room. The optimum maneuver is a chandelle, using both
vertical and horizontal offset, to a low 6 o’clock position on the target,
never leaving the blind zone. Obtaining a tally is not generally difficult
unless a large altitude delta is present. From a tally to a kill, basic fighter
maneuver (BFM) principles apply. Due to the nose-high entry, terrain
avoidance is less of a consideration. However, there are two situations
that deserve attention:

e Attempting to square the corner in the final conversion may result

in your being nose-high, slow and at low altitude. Accepting the
overshoot through the blind zone, with energy, is a better option.

AAM-10 D-16


Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_23.jpeg:
e After operating at minimum altitudes, 2000 feet above ground
level (AGL) appears to be very high. It is an illusion that has
proved fatal to many good aviators on pop-up attacks and air-to-air
engagements with helicopters.

High-to-Low Intercepts

GCI, AWACS and the APG-70 enable detection of low altitude threats.
BVR rules of engagement simplify employment, but certain situations
dictate a conversion into the low altitude regime to employ weapons. Lost
radar locks due to gimbal limits or beam clutter, target terrain masking,
and camouflage, complicate a kill at low altitude. It is necessary to clear
the area around the target with the radar, as well as visually, to prevent a
sandwich. The high-to-low conversion at low altitude has some unique
differences from medium/high altitude conversions. Normally, an early,
aggressive turn gets much of the turn out of the way, which allows
concentrating on the target, rather than the ground, in the final part of
the conversion. Plan the conversion to end up slightly higher than the
target so an overshoot, if it occurs, does not result in ground impact.

To accomplish this conversion, get your tally on the target early (8-10 nm)
by aggressively pulling the TD box into the HUD and/or by canopy code
information. Once the target is in sight, discontinue pure pursuit as this
sacrifices all vertical turning room and requires a 2-dimensional “Square
Corner” to finish the corner slow. Rather, maintain several thousand feet
of vertical above the target, while your nose track keeps proper proportion
to the target's LOS. Turn hard above the target in a 2-dimensional POM
(can be slightly descending to preserve energy) until behind the 3/9 line of
the target.

Now the conversion can be finished by dropping the nose, gaining closure
and entering firing position while monitoring both the ground and the
target together. Airspeed advantage for a tail chase situation can be
achieved if some vertical separation is maintained in the final portion of
the intercept.

D-17 AAM-10


Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_24.jpeg:
Co-altitude Intercepts

Problems encountered in the high-to-low intercept may still be a problem
with this type intercept. Terrain masking by the target is much more of a
problem, and dead reckoning the target's new position may be your only
option. The TSD can be used as an aid in predicting the target’s position
when LOS is broken. Radar employment over flat or slightly rolling
terrain should be effective. Finally, weapons employment is more of a
problem in low-to-low profile. Remember the pursuit curves for low
altitude intercepts, but adjust them for target speed.

Common Low Altitude Intercept Errors

e Intercepting a shadow instead of the target
e Failing to obtain a tally before the radar breaks lock

e Carrying too much airspeed, which increases turn radius, requires
more G, and is harder to slow down

e Starting conversion too late and encountering difficulty in
generating closing velocity at low altitude.

Conversion Aborts

The potential need to abort a conversion is a major concern in the
high-to-low intercepts. Avoid a pure high-to-low, “Split-S” type
conversion. Rolling more than 135° is not advised. Attempting a slice to
an altitude slightly higher than the target’s altitude precludes ground
impact. If dive recovery safety parameters are exceeded at any time, or
the conversion “feels” uncomfortable, roll wings level and recover. If
necessary use the emergency dive recovery procedures in the F-15EK Dash
1, or the low altitude dive recovery rules in the F-15E AFTTP 3-3.

High/Low Speed Targets

A faster target requires a colder intercept pursuit curve with enough offset
to prevent losing airspeed/energy in the final conversion turn. This
requires the aircrew to monitor the radar for closure and target true
airspeed and/or obtain target speed from AWACS/GCI. Low speed targets
require close monitoring of the closure and aspect angle to prevent
overshoots. Remember, the pure pursuit curve numbers, that were shown
earlier, apply to co-speed targets.

AAM-10 D-18


Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_25.jpeg:
WEAPONS SELECTION

The increased air density at low altitude significantly decreases weapons
envelopes because of kinematics and missile seeker difficulty in picking
the target out of high ground clutter. Additionally, missile-to-ground
impact is a consideration for all missile attacks. All missiles attempt to fly
a pursuit curve (usually lead) that allows a collision course with 0° LOS to
the target. This means if the missile is launched with the target climbing,
the missile climbs toward the predicted impact point. It also means if the
missile is launched while the target is descending, the missile dives
toward the predicted impact point and may strike the ground en route.
With either IR or radar missiles, firing with a slight nose-high attitude
reduces ground impact problems. Flying low to achieve look-up (blue sky)
may improve seeker acquisition, but may also plant the first round in the
dirt 1000 feet at 12 o’clock, if the launch altitude is not sufficient for the
missile to attain flying speed prior to ground impact.

AIM-120

Given early radar detection, the AIM-120, with its long range capability,
usually presents the first shot opportunity at low altitude. The AIM-120
has features which provide flexible employment options. These features
include: off-boresight shot capability; all aspect, beyond visual range
(BVR) capability; and an active seeker which does not require continuous
radar illumination from the launch aircraft. These features permit the
launch aircraft to fire a good data link shot and, once the missile is active,
maneuver to use low altitude/terrain to hide and/or avoid any return
shots. At low altitude, missile time-to-active usually occurs soon after the
shot. Refer to AFTTP/AFTTP 3-1, Vol XVII.

D-19 AAM-10


Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_26.jpeg:
AIM-7

At low altitude, AIM-7 launch parameters must meet seeker head
requirements and be adequate to ensure the missile does not impact the
ground while it is gaining flying airspeed following launch. There are
additional problems if the shooter must remain at low altitude during
missile launch and throughout missile time of flight (TOF). Unlike in the
AIM-120 case, following an AIM-7 launch, both the F-15E radar and
missile must maintain line of sight (LOS) with the target throughout
missile TOF. At low altitude, terrain features affect radar/missile
capability against a target changing his aspect angle in relation to the
shooter.

The same maneuvers required to keep a tally also preserve radar LOS,
but the altitude may be higher than required to deny an adversary shot.
Refer to AFTTP 3-1 for shot/kill criteria.

AIM-9

The AIM-9M maintains its all aspect capability at low altitude, but its
employment ranges are significantly decreased. It is very important to
ensure proper seeker track of the target at low altitude both with a visual
indication and the aural tone. Adverse background IR sources can drive
the seeker LOS off the target.

Gun

Employing the gun at low altitude requires controlling the same factors as
in medium/high altitude gun shots: range, lead and plane-of-motion
(POM). The last of these, POM, is even more important at low altitude
because the low altitude fight tends to be primarily two-dimensional.
Since POM is so close to the ground, any out-of-plane maneuver by either
the defender or attacker could be catastrophic. Lead pursuit can also put
the attacker in the position of having a terrain obstacle in his flight path
as he flies inside the defender's turn. Careful control of G, closure,
airspeed and relative position are necessary to achieve a tracking solution.
Wake turbulence when crossing the bandit's 6 o’clock position can also
cause out-of-plane problems. Continue to look for the missile shot.

CONTINGENCIES
No Radar/Bad Systems

Before takeoff, there are certain minimum essential systems that must be
operational (go/no-go items). These include, but are not limited to: the
RADAR, INS, ICS/CMD, RWR, IFF/MODE IV, and weapons systems.
Once airborne, however, loss of any one of these systems may or may not
require a mission abort. This will depend on the flight lead’s briefed
tactical scenario and the point in the mission where the system fails. In
terms of low altitude air-to-air employment, loss of the radar will most
likely immediately dictate certain constraints. First, the sick-radar
aircraft now becomes the tactical wingman; and the other aircraft, if not
already the lead, assumes the tactical lead. Second, in any engagement,
the radar aircraft should assume he will have a support fighter, and
therefore, needs to ensure that the support fighter is visually tied to the
tactical lead. Finally, the aircrew with the good radar must provide as
much information as is tactically feasible to the other aircrew in terms of
an engaged plan, tactics, tallies, etc. If possible, avoidance of any threat is
probably the smartest option, unless mission requirements dictate
otherwise.

Group Targeting/Sorting

When operating at low altitude, it is still necessary to maintain the
targeting/sorting disciplines applicable to medium/high radar
employment. However, the minimum ranges at which these tasks are
accomplished within the flight can usually be reduced, due to reduced
ranges on weapon envelopes (reference AFTTP 3-1 Vol XVII). Group
targeting should be finished by 20-25 nm, with element sorting within
those groups accomplished NLT 15 nm from the merge. If using these
ranges for targeting/sorting, meld ranges must be briefed and complied
with due to high radar LOS rates on the shorter range radar displays.

Short Range Radar Contact/Commit

If a member of the flight achieves a short range (<15 nm) hostile lock-on
that is converting to the flight, immediate action is necessary. That
aircraft must maneuver to engage and call the “engaged” status. This
alerts the other aircraft who can then use the engaged aircraft as a
pointer for radar and visual acquisition. The engaged fighter should
immediately launch an A/A missile, if in parameters, while
simultaneously acquiring a tally. A combination of canopy-code references

D-21 AAM-10


Text from AAM-10_Low_Altitude_Air-to-Air_Employment_page_28.jpeg:
and the HUD TD box should be used to acquire the bandit as quickly as
possible. This information should then be communicated to the flight.

Initially, this action could lend itself to pure pursuit of the bandit, but,
once tally is achieved, proper BFM maneuvering for weapons employment
should be used. The wingman should not, in most cases, maneuver into
the same POM as the engaged fighter, but should remain at low altitude
and maneuver to a support position. This gives the element a split-plane
BFM entry to the merge. At the merge, the flight can then either continue
to engage, or turn high aspect to a blow-through separation.

Element Targeted/Threat Reactions

If the RWR signals a BVR threat in the forward quadrant, some decisions
concerning offensive/defensive threat reaction must be made. If there is
no radar contact on the threat, an element maneuver to put the RWR
spike on the beam is the best move. Simultaneously, look for a tally of the
bandits and/or a missile in the air. On the other hand, if your element is
trading shots with the bandits, take full advantage of the range of your
missiles, shot doctrine, and F-pole maneuvers. If taking low altitude
Fox-1s and subsequent F-Poles, watch for the tendency to fly into a low
altitude terrain mask situation that prohibits radar LOS. Additionally,
the maneuvers utilized to avoid terrain may inadvertently gimbal the
radar lock. These problems can be encountered when using simple
avoidance maneuvers as well. Remember, the wingman on the outside of
the formation in relation to the threat will lose radar situation awareness
(SA) sooner than the lead. Refer to AFTTP 3-1 Volume XVII for Low
Altitude AIM-120 Tactics.

If notching a bandit, start at 12-10 nm, depending on the threat, using
both radar and RWR information to determine what initial heading will
put the threat on the beam. Once the bandit is on the beam, perform an
arc much like is done when arcing a TACAN on an instrument approach.
Since the bandit will be traveling 8-10 nm/minute, it will take 60 seconds
for the merge to occur. Two methods work well to maintain the beam
maneuver. The first method is to check 10° back toward the bandit every
5 seconds. After 35-40 seconds (70-80° total turn), it is time to do an idle
power break into the bandit that has been visually acquired. The other
method is similar to the first but calls for a 10° check into the bandit after
10 seconds, then 9 seconds, then 8, etc... when you get to 5 seconds (70° of
total turn) it is time to break into the threat. The break maneuver should
be performed 2-4 nm from the bandit which will permit a high aspect
merge with the bandit and an opportunity to disengage. Since avoiding
the beam IR-missile shot from the converting bandit is important, an

early tally and effective IRMD is required. Refer to AFTTP 3-1 Volume
XVII for an expanded discussion of all-aspect and IR missile defense
tactics.

Stern Threat

Another situation requiring low altitude consideration is a bandit acquired
at the element's 6 o'clock position, attempting to run down the element to
weapons employment. Once acquired, the flight should select afterburner
and attempt to pull away. Simultaneously, a “float” can be
called/executed by the element. This maneuver is a 20-30° check turn by
each aircraft, away from his wingman, causing diverging flight paths.

The trailing bandit is now forced to make a positional decision as the
element separation gets wide (2-3 nm). Ifthe trailing bandit decides to
continue trailing the element member, this gives a turning entry to the
wingman (Figure D-7).

TEXT
INTRODUCTION

This text deals with the air-to-air employment considerations in the low
altitude environment. It is not feasible to incorporate all potential tactical
options into one lesson. While medium and high altitude ingress options
have valid applications, and the combined effects of mixed force packages
are well recognized, this text is restricted to F-15-only formations in
autonomous low level operations.

FORMATION CONSIDERATIONS

However, the flight members must consider the difficulty of maneuvering
due to terrain features, the decreased ability to maintain visual in rough
terrain, and the proximity of surface-to-air threats. Task loading for all
flight members is higher at low altitude due to these considerations.

The wingman's task loading can be even higher due to formation flying;
therefore, the formation contract within the element should allow the
wingman a more flexible lateral spacing of 4000-12,000 feet. The
wingman may close into 4000 feet where an easier visual can be
maintained when flight maneuvers, terrain, environment and avionics
task load become severe. When task loading is not as demanding, the
wingman can move out to 12,000 feet to decrease the possibility of a
threat gaining tally on both aircraft. These ranges are not mandatory for
all situations. Generally, maintaining visual and maneuvering the flight
are more difficult when lateral spacing exceeds 12,000 feet. Supporting
the wingman after an adversary has swung the flight’s 3/9 line is very
difficult if the flight is separated by over 12,000 feet, particularly when
only AIM-9s are available. If spacing is less than 4000 feet, the
adversaries are guaranteed tally-2, and flight path deconfliction is much
more involved while turning due to turn radius. Additionally, visual
arena defensive reactions become difficult due to reduced reaction times,
missile minimum ranges, and the wingman being inside missile
field-of-view (weapons deconfliction).

Trail or Wedge

Tactical trail or “wedge” formation is another option for an element at low
altitude. However, it should only be used as a last resort. One viable
reason for utilizing wedge is the need to remain at very low altitude.
Another is the need to maneuver at low altitude over very rough terrain.
Wedge is normally flown in a fluid cone 30-70° aft of line abreast of the
leader, at fluid ranges of 4000-9000 feet (Figure D-2).

AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_10.jpeg:
Drag

Drag is the force that resists the movement of an object through the air
mass. Since it must be overcome by thrust, it is generally given a vector
value in the opposite direction of thrust. Total drag on the aircraft comes
from three basic sources (Figure D-3).

Subsonic Drag

Induced Drag

Induced drag is that portion of total drag that comes from the production
of lift. When propelling an airfoil through the air, a split in the air mass
occurs. Because of the shape of the airfoil, the air moving across the top of
the airfoil must travel a farther distance and therefore must move faster
than the air moving across the bottom. This creates a low pressure on top
of the wing and higher pressure underneath it (lift). Naturally, the high
pressure air tries to flow into the area of low pressure wherever it can,
and this occurs at the wing tips and at the trailing edge. This
phenomenon generates a net downwash in the free air stream behind the
wing. There is a physical resistance to the generation of this downwash
that must be overcome and the resistance is called induced drag. Induced
drag is greater at high angles of attack and/or low airspeeds.

WAVE DRAG

AAM-01-03

Figure D - 3. Total Drag.

AAM-1 D-4


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_11.jpeg:
Parasite Drag

Parasite drag is that portion of total drag that is caused by disturbing the
air mass with the profile of the aircraft and everything that is hung on it.
Parasite drag is divided into several subcategories as depicted in Figure
D-8, but does not require detailed study here.

Wave Drag

Wave drag is almost a negligible factor at lower airspeeds, but becomes
such a factor at transonic speeds that it cannot be ignored. It does, in fact,
have a significant influence on the design of the aircraft. At any speed, an
aircraft moving through the air mass creates pressure disturbances that
move away from the aircraft at the speed of sound. This creates an
invisible “bow wave” in front of the aircraft. If this bow wave is made
visible in a wind tunnel with the use of smoke, the air actually begins to
separate well ahead of the approaching aircraft. When entering the
transonic range, portions of the aircraft are supersonic, and the pressure
disturbances at these points cannot be propagated forward because they
run into sonic velocities traveling in the opposite direction. In this case,
the disturbances are propagated perpendicular to the direction of the sonic
flow (sort of “stacked up” right at the point of disturbance).

This instantaneous compression/decompression of air molecules causes an
energy loss that must continuously be made up by the engines. This
energy loss represents a type of drag known as wave drag. The point at
which wave drag becomes a factor is called the drag divergence Mach, and
is illustrated in Figure D-4 where the coefficient of lift (C,,) is being held
constant as airspeed is increased. Note that only a slight increase in
airspeed causes a dramatic rise in wave drag. Also note from the figure
that once supersonic flight is reached, wave drag effect decreases
dramatically.


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_12.jpeg:
For an aircraft to operate routinely in the transonic region, such as in this
case, the drag divergence Mach is delayed as much as possible by
sweeping the wing. Since a certain amount of lift is lost by sweeping the
wing (Figure D-4), the F-15E wing is a compromise—being swept at
approximately 45°. In the F-15E, expect significant wave drag at about
0.95 Mach.

Although the aircraft has been designed to minimize the effects of drag,
the aircrew can still change the amount of drag by varying:

e air density (the denser the air around the aircraft, the more drag it
creates),

e true airspeed (the faster the aircraft goes, the more air is
compressed),

e lift coefficient (the more lift is generated, the more induced drag is
created), and

e aircraft configuration (the more stores hung on the aircraft, the
more parasite drag is created).

Minimum drag in the F-15E is achieved at 8-10 units AOA. This AOA
also produces the best acceleration. At slower airspeeds, this equals
approximately %4 - %G. In the 400-500 KCAS region, 8-10 units AOA is
approximately 1 G. Above 500 KCAS, 8-10 units AOA actually occurs at
2-3 G! As a rule of thumb for fast acceleration, for airspeeds below 400
KCAS, you should feel light in the seat (4% G) and for airspeeds above 400
KCAS, you should be at about 1 G.


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_14.jpeg:
Optimum Turn

For those times when something less than a maximum turn is acceptable
in order to preserve airspeed, the optimum turn is available. The
optimum turn is the best trade-off between turn performance and airspeed
control.

Optimum turn in the F-15E is achieved at 16-22 units AOA. This AOA
gives the maximum turn rate for a particular airspeed without depleting
energy.

Thrust

Thrust is provided by the engines and is the force that propels the aircraft
forward. The net thrust of a aircraft engine depends on the amount of air
and how fast the air is accelerated through the engine. In other words:

T =M (V2- V1)

Where: _ T = thrust; M = air mass; V2 = exit velocity;
Vi = intake velocity

The engine has been designed to maximize these variables through
state-of-the-art technology; but the aircrew still has the capability to
control the mass of air being processed by varying air density (air at sea
level is twice as dense as air at 22,000 feet), true airspeed (the faster the
aircraft goes, the more air is forced into the engine) and throttle setting
(the faster the engine turns, the more air it processes).

In Figure D-9, note the aerodynamic center (AC). This is the point on the
aircraft where all changes in lift occur. Its position remains relatively
constant, regardless of the angle-of-attack. The other significant point in
Figure D-9 is the center of gravity (CG), which is the point about which all
changes of weight occur. To further simplify this discussion, locate the AC
and CG along the fuselage reference line (FRL). Note that the AC is
located aft of the CG. The significance of this will become clear in the
discussion of longitudinal stability.

Longitudinal Stability refers to the behavior of the aircraft in pitch. If the
aircraft is trimmed for level flight, and then is disturbed in pitch and
tends to return to the trimmed angle-of-attack, it is said to be statically
stable in pitch. Without computerized flight controls, it is important to
have the aircraft stable in pitch so that the pilot is not constantly fighting
to maintain control. Longitudinal stability is primarily dependent upon
the relative location of the aerodynamic center and the center of gravity.
The symmetrical airfoil section shown in Figure D-10 shows two possible
locations of CG and AC.

Figure D - 10. CG and AC Location.

If the wing in Figure D-10 (A) experiences an upgust, the lift vector is
increased due to the change in angle-of-attack. The increase in lift causes
the wing to rotate nose down around the CG, thereby reducing the
angle-of-attack and restoring the value of lift to its original condition.
This wing has positive longitudinal stability. If the wing in Figure D-10
(B) experiences an upgust, the lift vector is again increased, but the wing
rotates nose up around the CG, thereby increasing the angle-of-attack
even more causing the nose to pitch up further. This is an unstable
condition. Note from the illustration that the CG must be ahead of the AC
to have positive longitudinal stability. In fact, the further ahead the CG
is, the more stable the aircraft is. Conversely, the closer together the CG
and AC, the more sensitive the aircraft is in pitch (less stable/more
maneuverable).

Although the wing in Figure D-10 (A) has positive longitudinal stability, it
is not in equilibrium—that is, the forces are not balanced. A lifting force
aft of the CG pitches the wing (and consequently the aircraft) nose down.
To counter this obviously undesirable characteristic, an offsetting and
equal nose up force must be created. This may be done through use of a
canard or a horizontal tail. In the case of the F-15E, a horizontal
stabilator has been utilized. In order for the stabilator to provide a nose
up moment, it must be made to create downward or negative lift (Figure
D-11).

Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_21.jpeg:
Again, the relative locations of AC and CG determine the longitudinal
stability of the aircraft. The CG, however, is constantly on the move as a
result of ordnance being expended/jettisoned and/or fuel being consumed
or dumped. That movement, as illustrated in Figure D-12, directly affects
handling characteristics of the aircraft.

AAM-01-12

Figure D - 12. CG Movement.

The burn off of fuel in the F-15E does not affect CG as much as in some
aircraft. The CG is slightly forward when full (slightly more stable) and
moves slightly aft as internal fuel is burned (slightly less stable).
However, CFT's and any stores loaded aft of the CG have a greater
destabilizing effect on the aircraft in pitch. This destabilizing effect is
most critical at higher angles-of-attack with centerline stores on board
because turbulent air created by the stores tends to wash out stabilator
authority. Change in pitch sensitivity is not normally noticeable by the
aircrew due to effects of the pitch trim compensator; however, in the event
of loss of CAS, these changes are definitely noticeable. Hung
air-to-ground stores on the aft CFT stations may put the CG behind the
aft limit. The CAS masks adverse effects, but with failed pitch CAS, the
pilot may have to jettison wing stores to regain satisfactory longitudinal
stability.

Supersonic flight moves the AC aft approximately 25% of the mean
aerodynamic chord from its subsonic position (Figure D-13).

WEIGHT

AAM-01-13

Figure D - 13. AC Shift.

This has the same effect as moving the CG forward in that it decreases
the authority of the stabilator and makes the aircraft more stable. In this
condition, the stick can actually be pulled completely aft without fear of an
aircraft over G. In some aircraft, there is a significant “transonic dig in,”
which occurs when the AC shifts forward as the aircraft decelerates from
supersonic to subsonic and the aircraft is under more than one positive G.
This phenomenon and “Mach tuck,” which occurs when crossing Mach 1.0
accelerating, are both unnoticeable in the F-15E because the flight control
system (FCS) completely masks them. However, if the FCS is not working
properly, both are there to be reckoned with. Transonic dig can cause an
over G with the pitch CAS OFF and pitch ratio EMERG.

Lateral Stability refers to the behavior of the aircraft in roll, and is
primarily dependent on the geometry of the wing. The F-15E is designed
to exhibit only slightly positive lateral stability characteristics in order to
produce rapid roll rates when desired. The CAS eliminates most of the
adverse characteristics of near neutral stability in roll, yet allows
exceptional control capability. During routine operations, the only
changes experienced in lateral stability are due to external stores hung
under the aircraft. Symmetrical external stores have a tendency to
increase lateral stability because they represent extra surface area that
must be moved against the airstream during a roll. They also require a
greater force in overcoming inertia to start a roll. Exceptions are
LANTIRN pods and the centerline tank which reduce lateral stability.

AAM-1 D-16


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_23.jpeg:
Directional Stability refers to the behavior of the aircraft in yaw, and is
primarily influenced by the surface of the vertical tails. The F-15E
exhibits positive directional characteristics in yaw, with or without CAS
being operational. Once again, during routine operations, the only thing
that changes directional stability is external stores. Generally speaking,
external stores have a destabilizing effect on directional
stability—especially those which are hung forward of the center of gravity
(i.e., LANTIRN pods). When the aircraft is yawed, either due to gust
factor or rudder input, the increased surface area of the external stores
catches more of the relative wind and aggravates the yawing motion.

Stability, then, affects capability to control the aerodynamic forces acting

on the aircraft in flight and, subsequently, the ability to move the aircraft.

The F-15E, while designed to exhibit positive stability characteristics in
all three axes, is not so stable that it cannot produce rapid roll and
G-onset rates. This is an important factor when maneuvering in the
air-to-air environment.

TURN PERFORMANCE
Definitions

Instantaneous Corner Velocity

The minimum velocity at which maximum G can be obtained is defined as
instantaneous corner velocity. Below this speed, buffet or stall are
encountered; above this speed, the structural limit is encountered first.

Sustained Corner Velocity

Sustained corner velocity is the speed at which a maximum, sustained
rate of turn can be achieved for a given power setting. It is a function of
thrust, since it occurs where G is at maximum attainable without an
accompanying loss of speed and/or altitude.

Sustained Turn

Sustained turn refers to the sustained rate and radius of a turn for a given
power setting, without an accompanying loss of speed and/or altitude.

Structural Limits

Structural limits refers to the maximum airspeed or G beyond which
structural damage occurs. Maximum G determines the upper limits of an
aircraft's envelope. Total dynamic air pressure, or max Q, defines the
right hand boundary to the envelope.

Limits to Turn Performance

Although there may be many variables which determine the outcome of a
particular air-to-air engagement such as surprise, aircrew proficiency,
type of weapons, etc.; the turn performance of the aircraft involved may
play a major role in the outcome of a turning engagement. The F-15E,
although designed for the deep interdiction role, boasts exceptionally fine
turning performance. The turning ability of any aircraft, however, is
limited by several factors.

AAM-1 D - 20

Amount of Lift Obtainable

Generally speaking, the more lift that is generated on a particular
airframe, the better it turns. As noted earlier in this workbook, the
amount of lift generated with a given wing area is directly controllable by
the pilot. Therefore, by varying density altitude, true airspeed and
angle-of-attack (C,,), the pilot is varying the turn performance of his
aircraft. In Figure D-14 below, a C,max curve is plotted against airspeed
and G to give a good depiction of how lift affects turn performance. Flight
in the area left/above the C,max curve is not possible because boundary
layer separation occurs, lift is reduced, and this automatically results in a
decreased load factor.

Note that density altitude is not included as a variable on the chart. This
means that the chart is only good for the particular altitude at which it
was figured.


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_28.jpeg:
Amount of G Permissible

This limit to turn performance is the maximum G the aircraft is designed
to withstand. It may also be a lesser limit imposed by higher
headquarters or wing/squadron authorities to help the aircraft last longer.
In the latter case, the pilot does not receive a caution through the OWS
that the aircraft is approaching this limit. The G limit may also be plotted
on the same type graph that is used for lift obtainable (see Figure D-15).
Notice that a maximum of 9 Gs is not allowable at higher airspeeds due to
rapidly increasing pressure loads at the higher Mach numbers. OWS
figures this decreasing G limit value for the pilot and continues to give
accurate warnings of an impending or actual over G.

NOTE

Amount of Thrust Available

This limit to turn performance may affect you in one of several ways.
First, it determines the amount of G sustainable at current flight
conditions. Producing G means producing lift, and producing lift means
producing induced drag that must, in turn, be overcome with thrust.
Since the amount of thrust available in the F-15E, although significant, is
still finite, the aircraft can only pull a finite amount of G before losing
airspeed. Secondly, thrust available determines maximum speed, given
current flight conditions. This limit can also be depicted on the same type
of graph used to plot G allowable and C,max limits to turn performance
(Figure D-16). Note that in some conditions our maximum speed may
actually be an aircraft limit rather than a thrust limit, in which case max
speed would remain fixed as depicted on the graph and excess thrust could
only be used to climb or turn. Although airspeed limit (allowable and/or
attainable) is influenced by stores, it is disregarded for this example.

If the three limits to turn performance are all plotted on the same graph
(Figure D-17), the depicted flight “envelope” represents the performance to
be expected from the aircraft in a given set of flight conditions. Ifa
number of these charts are used with different sets of flight conditions, a
better understanding occurs of how the aircraft’s turning performance is
improved or degraded. Also, there is a basis for comparing two different
aircraft in otherwise identical flight conditions.

Turn Performance Measurements

While the performance envelope in Figure D-17 gives some good cockpit
indicators of what to expect from the aircraft, it does little to show how
well the aircraft is actually turning. Turn performance can be measured
in two different ways. First, the rate at which the aircraft is turning—that
is, how quickly the aircraft is getting around the circle. Secondly, the
radius of the circle the aircraft is turning. Let us examine each of these
measurements separately.

AAM-1 D - 24


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_31.jpeg:
Turn Rate

Turn rate is measured in degrees per second-the higher the turn rate, the
better the turn. It can be derived from the following formula:

Gr xgxK
oOo = ——
V
where:
@ = turn rate (deg/sec)
Gr =radialG
g = gravity constant (32.2 ft/sec’)
K = conversion constant for radians to degrees
(57.3 deg/rad)

V_ =aircraft velocity (ft/sec)

Since the formula contains two constants and only two variables, throw
out the constants and say that:

Turn rate is solely dependent on true airspeed and radial G. Nothing else
enters into the equation. The important relationship to glean from this
formula is that if airspeed is held constant and radial G is increased, turn
rate is increased (better turn). Conversely, if radial G is held constant and
airspeed is increased, turn rate is decreased (worse turn).


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_32.jpeg:
Turn Radius

Turn radius is measured in feet—the smaller the radius the better the
turn. It can be derived from the following formula:

Vr
R = ———
g xX Gr

where:
R_- = turn radius (feet)
V_ =aircraft velocity (ft/sec)
g = gravity constant (32.2 ft/sec’)
Gr =radialG

Once again throw out the constant and say that:

Ve
R= ——
Gr

Understand that the two variables that determine turn rate (true airspeed
and radial G) are also the same two variables that determine turn
radius—and in the same manner. Holding airspeed constant and
increasing radial G results in a smaller turn radius (better turn) and a
higher turn rate (also better turn), whereas holding radial G constant and
increasing airspeed results in a larger turn radius (worse turn) and lower
turn rate (also worse turn).

What was just learned, in addition to the two variables that determine
turn rate/radius, is that any two aircraft have exactly the same turn
performance if they are at the same airspeed and radial G. At 350 knots
and 2 Gs, a Boeing 747 and an F-15E have exactly the same turn rate and
radius. Likewise, at 60 knots and 2 Gs a Piper Cub and an F-15E have
the same turn rate/radius. Unfortunately, at 60 knots, the F-15E is not
capable of pulling 1 G, much less 2 Gs. But the Piper Cub can easily pull
2 Gs at 60 knots, and therein lies the difference in turn
performance—amount of G available at a given airspeed.

Radial G and the “Egg”

Given the fact that lift and weight do not always directly oppose each
other, how do these forces interact if the aircraft is in other than straight
and level flight?

If an aircraft is banked and G is not increased, the aircraft cannot
maintain level flight. Figure D-18 shows why this occurs. Note that
weight and lift vectors have remained constant, but because lift always
acts in the plane of symmetry, and weight always acts toward the center
of earth, the lift vector has been effectively divided into vertical and
horizontal components. The portion of the lift vector opposing weight is
now less than the weight component, so the aircraft descends.

Figure D - 18. Radial G.

The horizontal portion of the lift vector is an unbalanced force and causes
the aircraft to move in that direction. The aircraft continues to accelerate
toward this “centripetal force” until it is matched by a balancing
“centrifugal force” and equilibrium is re-established. The acceleration
toward the center of rotation is known as radial acceleration or radial G.

Note also in the figure above, that when the aircraft is totally inverted
and still maintaining one positive G, the lift and weight vectors are in
consonance and are added together.

AAM-1


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_34.jpeg:
Therefore, depending on the placement of lift vector, gravity may be
helping or hurting turn performance. In Figure D-19, the G felt on your
body and read on the cockpit G meter is labeled Gr or total G and is the
value of the lift vector in the plane of symmetry. The value of radial G
(Gr) is the measure of turn performance and is a summation of the values
of total G and weight (W).

PLANE OF TURN

AAM-01-19

Figure D- 19. Radial G.

Anytime lift vector is pointed above the horizon, gravity is reducing radial
G/turning performance; anytime the lift vector is pointed below the
horizon, gravity is increasing radial G/turning performance (Figure D-19).
This is true regardless of whether the aircraft is turning in the horizontal
or in the pure vertical.

AAM-1 D - 28


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_35.jpeg:
To demonstrate this, Figure D-20 shows an aircraft performing a constant
airspeed, constant 4-G loop. Notice that instead of being a perfect circle,
the effect of radial G produces an egg-shaped maneuver. In actual flight,
the aircraft would tend to decelerate during the climb (thrust minus
gravity) and accelerate during the dive (thrust plus gravity) which would
accentuate the egg-shape of the maneuver even more. Try to visualize
this egg-shape in three-dimensional form. This “tactical egg” is referred to
throughout the air-to-air phase of academic and flight instruction.

Figure D - 20. Effects of Radial G on Constant Airspeed.

Most new fighter aircrews who have trouble in the air-to-air phase do so
because they do not understand the concept of radial G and how it affects
turning performance. Being born and raised in a flat, three-dimensional
world often makes maneuvering in the vertical or oblique a difficult and
foreign concept. However, a total understanding of radial G is essential to
successful aerial combat.

The point at which the highest turn rate occurs with the smallest turn
radius (best turn) is in the upper left corner of the chart where the max
allowable G can be obtained with the least amount of airspeed (see
Figure D-25). Due to its position on the chart, the airspeed that produces
the best turn is called “corner velocity.”

Figure D - 25. Corner Velocity.

What this means is that if the aircraft is at corner velocity, with the
configuration and altitude given in the chart, the pilot can pull full aft stick
without fear of an aircraft over G. Note that if airspeed is greater than
corner velocity, G must remain constant, which results in a degraded turn
performance. Conversely, if airspeed is decreased below corner velocity,
maximum G can no longer be obtained and turn performance is again
degraded. The plot for corner velocity assumes full AB and a horizontal
turn.

Another way to state this relationship is-when airspeed is increased past
corner velocity, G must be increased to maintain the same turn rate and
radius. Since there is no more G available, turn radius increases and turn
rate decreases. When airspeed is decreased below corner velocity there is
less G available so turn radius increases, but not as rapidly, and turn rate
decreases more dramatically. There is a tactical time and place to use both
principles.


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_42.jpeg:
In most instances, you could expect to lose airspeed when performing this
type of turn, which means quickly moving to another point on the
chart-either to less G while maintaining C,max or to an accelerated stall.
Therefore, usually consider a corner velocity turn as being an
instantaneous turn, in that it is only available for an instant of time
before starting to decrease turn rate and/or increase turn radius.
However, a compromise occurs from corner velocity toward a sustainable
maneuvering condition at less G, while maintaining a C, that does not
approach a stall.

To maintain the best possible turn for an indefinite period of time, move
down and right on the chart, increasing airspeed, until finding the
maximum amount of G sustainable with full A/B and a level/horizontal
turn. Figure D-26 shows that sustained corner velocity occurs at the
lowest speed at which the maximum sustainable G can be achieved—not to
exceed the aircraft G limit. How to compute this point is covered later in
this workbook. Note that unless corner velocity and sustained corner
velocity are coincident (this happens sometimes at low altitudes and low
drag indexes), sustained corner velocity usually results in a lesser turn
rate and greater turn radius. The advantage, however, is that it is
possible to continue turning at sustained parameters to gain the
advantage to kill the bandit.

Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_43.jpeg:
Earlier in this workbook, we learned that it is possible to optimize radial
G by aligning the aircraft’s lift and weight vectors. The absolute tightest
turn made at any given altitude and configuration is available when
purely inverted (top of the egg) at corner velocity. This becomes even
more advantageous when considering that during the turn the thrust
vector is in consonance with gravity allowing the turn to be sustained
longer. In the same vein, the worst corner velocity turn made is a vertical
pull at the bottom of the egg. Not only is the lift vector directly opposed by
gravity, but as the turn is continued, the thrust vector is opposed by
gravity causing an inability to sustain the turn for even a short period of
time. Therefore, the best compromise between a corner velocity turn and
a sustained turn is made by slicing diagonally through the egg in an
oblique loop (see Figure D-27). The tactical situation dictates when God’s
G is used to an advantage, and when gravity is desired against or neutral
to the aircraft.

Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_44.jpeg:
It is not always practical or logical to fly around at corner velocity, and the
time may arise when the best rate and radius of turn in a gun/missile
break is needed and the aircraft is not at corner velocity—what then? If
above corner velocity, immediately begin the turn at max G (careful, an
over G can easily occur here) and get back down to corner velocity as
quickly as possible. This can be done by selecting idle thrust and
extending the speedbrake while maintaining max G (up to about 500
KCAS). Just before reaching corner velocity, retract the speedbrake and
select full A/B. With a little practice, these actions can be timed so that
full A/B is reached just as corner velocity is reached.

If in the high speed arena where the speedbrake is not effective, the best
way to reach corner velocity is to slow with AOA/G and power modulation.
There are two cautions: (1) the speedbrake is designed to retract
automatically above 25 units AOA and, if the switch is left OUT, extend
again when the AOA drops below 25 units; (2) the speedbrake extension
telegraphs exactly what the pilot is doing to the adversary.

AAM-1 D - 38


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_45.jpeg:
On the other hand, the aircraft may be below corner velocity when the
quickest, tightest turn is needed. In this case, immediately select full A/B
and turn at C,;max. Use some finesse in this regime because C,;max can
be exceeded and turn performance degraded. Airspeed may or may not be
maintained during the turn, but there probably is no choice in the matter.
Continue turning at C,;max (use approximately 30 units AOA) until the
tactical situation allows the turn to be relaxed. At that point, leave the
throttles in full A/B and unload the aircraft to minimum drag (Cymin)
AOA. In the F-15E, minimum Cymax approximated at 8-10 units AOA as
indicated in Figure D-28, or just slightly less than 1 G (a light-in-the-seat
feeling, but not a negative G feeling). If supersonic, 8-10 units AOA occurs
with between 1 and 2 Gs on the aircraft until back in the subsonic range.
At times when the quickest, tightest turn is not required, the best trade-
off between turn performance and airspeed control is the optimum turn,
and it is always performed at 16-22 units AOA in the F-15E (a light buffet
on the wings).

ENERGY MANEUVERABILITY
Introduction

Victory in aerial combat usually goes to the aviator who flies and fights
smart. Top aviators throughout history have been able to emphasize their
relative strengths while exploiting the enemy’s relative weaknesses.
Although strengths and weaknesses may lie in any number of areas such
as training, tactics, weapons, etc., it is a basic premise that an aircraft's
maneuverability is the foundation upon which these other areas are built.
The development of the all-aspect missile is, in fact, an attempt to
neutralize the differences in dissimilar aircraft maneuverability.

However, it is a gross misconception to think that the turning dogfight has
gone the way of the biplane. Every conflict, since the invention of the
aircraft, in which enemy aircraft have engaged, has resulted in some sort
of close-in turning engagement. The key to winning those engagements
was, and is, energy management.

Traditionally, aviators have recognized the importance of energy by
attempting to always enter a fight with more altitude and airspeed than
their opponents. They noted that, when equally proficient crews in
identical aircraft begin to hassle, the one who enters the fight from a
higher altitude and/or airspeed usually wins. Thus, early studies of
energy were largely the result of trial and error in engagements. Slowly,
a number of specific data points were gathered as a means of comparing
aircraft performance. Among these were maximum airspeed and G, stall
airspeed, combat/service ceilings, and, most notably, wing loading and
thrust-to-weight ratio.

Wing Loading

Wing loading is obtained by dividing the aircraft weight by the surface
area of the wing LOAD- wis. . The assumption is that this allows a
comparison as to how much lift the aircraft generates for turn
performance, i.e., the lower the wing loading, the better the turn
performance. It is good for only one instant of time since no allowance can
be made for airspeed lost during the turn. Also, while it provides an
approximate comparison, it assumes that C, of the wings being compared
is identical or very similar, and that thrust for sustaining the turn is
identical or very similar. While the first assumption can be taken with a
grain of salt when comparing like generations of fighter aircraft, the
second assumption is usually grossly inaccurate. Wing loading then is not
able to stand by itself as a means of comparison.

Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_50.jpeg:
Thrust-to-Weight Ratio

The thrust-to-weight ratio was used as a means to overcome the
deficiencies inherent in using wing loading as a single means of comparing
dissimilar aircraft. It was simply the aircraft's maximum thrust divided
by its gross weight and expressed as a ratio. It allowed a snapshot look at
how much thrust an aircraft could produce for acceleration or climb
performance. When used with a wing loading comparison, one could get
an approximate feel for which may be the more maneuverable aircraft.
However, even when combined, these methods of comparison did not
provide the aviator with the knowledge of what part of the performance
envelope to utilize to take best advantage of the aircraft’s capabilities, nor
did it tell him what the results of performing in a specific regime would be
over a period of time.

Specific Power (P,)

The theory of specific power was proven with the proliferation of high
performance fighters in the late 1950s. It can be derived for a given
aircraft by the formula Ps; = (V/g) (dV/dt) + dH/dt.

Because power controls true airspeed and energy (which equates to the
capability to climb, increase turn rate, decrease turn radius and
accelerate/decelerate), it is the key to management of energy
maneuverability. It is one of the better ways, but certainly not an
absolute best way, to measure an aircraft's ability to change its total
energy state versus that of another aircraft under the same set of
circumstances.

V dV dH
s= Tt
G dt dt
where:
Vv = aircraft velocity (TAS in ft/sec)
g = gravity constant (32 ft/sec’)
dV/dt = aircraft acceleration (ft/sec’)
dH/dt = aircraft rate of climb/descent (ft/sec)

A positive value for Ps indicates that the aircrew can either climb,
accelerate, increase G or any combination of the three and not sacrifice
one of the other variables.

AAM-1 D - 44


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_51.jpeg:
A negative value for P, indicates that the aircraft cannot sustain its
current flight parameters. The aircrew must descend, decelerate, reduce
G, increase thrust or a combination of the four by some amount.

A zero value for Ps; indicates that the aircraft is in a flight condition where
all variables are balanced and no change in energy state is required to
sustain flight parameters. However, to climb, accelerate or increase G,
one or more of the other remaining flight parameters must be sacrificed.

Energy Maneuverability (EM) Diagram

Using a computer, a multitude of values for Ps; can be figured for the flight
conditions listed on any given performance management chart.
Connecting equal values of Ps yields constant P, contour lines as shown in
Figure D-29. When this is done, the graph is called an “Energy
Maneuverability Diagram.” Note that load factor lines have also been
added. EM diagrams represent performance capability of an aircraft for a
given set of conditions (altitude, gross weight, configuration and power
setting).

TURN RATE

AAM-01-29

Figure D - 29. Energy Maneuverability Diagram.


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_52.jpeg:
In addition to corner velocity, which is still evident as the peak of the
performance envelope (A), a number of other interesting points or regions
in the performance envelope now become evident.

Sustainable Envelope

The sustained envelope which was discussed earlier is now very evident
since it is outlined by the P, = 0 contour line. Note that sustained corner
velocity is the point where the zero Ps contour first intersects the max G
line (B). At higher altitudes/heavier gross weights, the zero Ps curve does
not reach the G limit line. In that case, sustained corner velocity would be
found at the point where the Ps; = 0 curve peaks out.

Best Energy Rate at Max G

At some point along the max G line, find a contour line which is tangent to
the max G line (interpolate if necessary). Although this occurs at a higher
Mach and lower turn rate than corner velocity, it produces the best energy
rate for maneuvers at maximum G. In other words, it is possible to climb
while turning at max G, if at the Mach indicated at point (C), and
continue to fly the Mach indicated at the same given point for succeeding
charts for different altitudes.

Comparing Ps

The EM diagram, like other methods of aircraft comparison, does have its
faults. Each diagram is applicable to only one altitude, configuration,
weight and power setting, and the diagram is only capable of considering
horizontal turns. In spite of that, comparing energy maneuverability
diagrams for aircraft in comparable combat configurations provides the
most usable and realistic method of aircraft comparison there is today.
Chart comparison should be used as a tool in training to fight against
dissimilar aircraft. “Knowing the nums,” of course, is not a panacea. The
old adage that Ps never killed anybody is undoubtedly true. However, the
aviator who arms himself with a comprehensive knowledge of the concepts
of energy maneuverability, becomes thoroughly proficient in the
performance of his aircraft, and knows something about the performance
of the adversary, has a much greater likelihood of finding himself in a
position to deliver ordnance rather than receive it!

BASIC AERODYNAMICS

Tremendous technological advances have been made and will continue to
be made to take the utmost advantage of the aerodynamic forces that
affect our aircraft in flight. The aerodynamic forces themselves, however,
have not changed since the Wright brothers’ first flight at Kitty Hawk,
NC. Figure D-1 depicts the four aerodynamic forces that continually act
on an aircraft in flight.

LIFT

WEIGHT

AAM-01-01

Figure D - 1. Aerodynamic Forces.

Knowing what factors affect these forces and which of the factors we can
control is absolutely essential to the fighter aircrew.

Bear in mind that the following discussion is only a review of basic
aerodynamics and is intended for use by some who may not have a
thorough understanding of aerodynamic principles. It does contain some
oversimplifications in places, and should not be used to satisfy research
requirements for your Ph.D. in Aerodynamics.

AAM-1


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_8.jpeg:
Lift

Lift is the component of the aerodynamic force that is perpendicular to the
relative wind.

Lift = 2 air density X velocity squared X coefficient of lift X wing
surface area (L = 2 rv’C;s).

Since wing surface area cannot be controlled (S = 608.0 ft? for the F-15E),
consider the other lift force variables, in which the pilot does have some
control:

e Air density (p “Rho”) - The pilot can increase air density by flying at
lower altitudes. Air at sea level is twice as dense as air at 22,000
feet.

e True airspeed (V) - Faster flight generates more lift.

¢ Coefficient of lift - The pilot can control lift by varying the angle of
attack (a). (The amount of a generated at a given airspeed is
determined by the G capability - see section on WEIGHT.)

Wing design and shape also impact coefficient of lift. Wing shape includes
camber, planform, aspect ratio and Reynolds number. This discussion is
limited to camber and planform.

e Camber - A measure of the curvature of an airfoil. (Flaps are the
only means of changing F-15E wing camber, but the pilot would not
normally use flaps in a maneuvering environment.)

e Planform - A top or bottom view of a wing/fuselage shape.
Summary:
Lift can be controlled by controlling:
p (air density) - via flight altitude

V (airspeed) - with the throttles
C,, (coefficient of lift) - using the stick (AOA)

e F-15E design contributes to the coefficient of lift through
characteristics of its own unique wing design.

AAM-1 D-2


Text from AAM-1_Performance_Management_page_9.jpeg:
Figure D-2 shows a C,, curve typical of a swept wing fighter as compared
to that of a straight wing aircraft. Note that the maximum C,, generated
by the straight wing is significantly greater than that of the swept wing.
The straight wing curve, however, drops off abruptly when a certain
angle-of-attack (AOA) is reached, indicating that the aircraft is no longer
effectively producing lift and is stalled. The swept wing curve does not
reach the value of lift that a straight wing does, but the swept wing is
capable of reaching much higher angles-of-attack and does not drop off
abruptly even after reaching an angle-of-attack which results in a
decrease in the amount of lift produced. Maintaining approximately

30 units AOA (moderate to heavy buffet without wing rock) always keeps
you close to C,MAx.

Figure D - 2. C, Curve Comparison.

Weight

Weight is the force of gravity and always acts toward the center of the
earth regardless of the aircraft's attitude. It does not directly oppose any
other single aerodynamic force unless one of the other aerodynamic force
vectors is positioned directly opposite the center of the earth. In straight
and level flight, lift is directly opposed by weight, but in vertical flight,
thrust or drag (depending on whether the aircraft is going up or down) is
opposed by weight.

Aspect Angle (AA)

AA is the angle from the tail of the target to the line of sight from the
target to the fighter (Figure D-3). Aspect angle is independent of fighter
heading but dependent on the target heading. The maximum possible AA
is 180° (presented as H for Head) and the minimum is 0° (presented as T
for Tail). When displayed on the air-to-air radar display, the AA is
associated with an L or R indicating which side of the target is visible to
the fighter. Aspect angle determines the intercept approach quadrant.
Aspect angle and range are the primary indications used in determining
the intercept geometry. Note that the fighter’s heading is not a factor
when computing aspect angle.

Antenna Train Angle (ATA)

ATA is the angle formed from the nose of your aircraft to the radar line of
sight to the target (Figure D-4). Essentially, it is where your radar is
looking to see the target. Due to radar search limitations, ATA is limited
to 60° left or right of the nose in search and 73° in STT. Independent of
target heading, ATA is dependent on the fighter heading. ATA in

CATA is the antenna train angle the fighter must maintain to be on a
collision course with the target (Figure D-5). Maintaining the target on
the CATA maintains a constant line of sight to the target.

AAM-02-05

Changes in the target heading or airspeed, or the fighter airspeed affect
the CATA. Fighter heading does not affect the CATA but is dependent on
the CATA if a collision course intercept is to be flown. A target on the
CATA maintains a constant azimuth and aspect angle. It does not drift
left or right. The CATA provides the quickest time to intercept the target
and the maximum conservation of overtake. The CATA may be
determined for co-speed targets by using the formula, CATA = 180° - AA.
To fly the CATA, the target is then offset that number of degrees from the
center of the air-to-air radar display toward the side of the display
opposite the target’s AA (left or right). Example: A target with a 15R AA
would have a CATA of 30° left.

Outside of 1.2 aero, fly the CATA by keeping the MRM steering dot
centered in the ASE circle. Inside 1.2 aero, centering the steering dot
provides missile-to-target collision steering, not aircraft-to-aircraft
collision steering.

AAM-2 D-6


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_13.jpeg:
HOT/COLD

The terms HOT and COLD (Figure D-6) refer to those areas of the radar
display that either tend to increase (HOT) or decrease (COLD) aspect
angle. The CATA is the dividing line between the HOT and COLD sides.
If the target is maintained on the HOT side, turning room decreases,
aspect angle increases and eventually the fighter would fly in front of the
target. If the target is maintained on the COLD side, turning room
increases, aspect angle decreases, and the fighter will eventually fly
behind the target.

The hot side of the display is defined as the side (left or right) which has
the CATA on it. The cold side would be the opposite side. The cold side of
the display is easily determined by using the aspect angle letter; i.e., 15L
indicates the cold side of the display to be the left side, while 15R means
the right side is the cold side. The hot side is the side opposite the aspect
letter.


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_14.jpeg:
Target Drift

When a target is not on the CATA, the line of sight (antenna train angle)
changes constantly. That change in scope azimuth is called drift. Correct
interpretation of target drift on the radar display is necessary to maintain
control of the intercept and make proper decisions during the intercept.

Nonmaneuvering target drift can be summarized in four “rules”
(Figure D-7).

Rule 1: A target on the CATA tracks straight down the radar display
and maintains a constant AA (target B).

Rule 2: Targets not on the CATA drift away from their CATA (targets A,
C, D, E).

Rule 3: A target’s track is steepest (less drift) near its CATA
(target A) (less drift).

Rule 4: A target on the nose drifts cold (target D) (except for an H aspect
which is on the CATA).

Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_15.jpeg:
Note that the fighter will cross in front of target A on the hot side of the
scope. In this case, aspect angle will initially increase, until it reaches its
maximum value. On the other hand, note that target C will drift cold
even though it is initially on the left side of the scope. The fighter will
pass behind the target.

Pursuit Types

At some point during an intercept it may be necessary to select a course to
the target’s stern. Examples include avoiding a threat’s all-aspect weapon
capability, tanker rejoin, rejoining on a target to provide assistance or
visually identify its type or origin, and achieving weapon employment
zones for stern aspect ordnance. Three types of pursuit courses may be
flown during the intercept stern conversion: pure pursuit, lead pursuit,
and lag pursuit.


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_16.jpeg:
Pure Pursuit

Pure pursuit (Figure D-8) is the primary means for converting to the
bandit’s 6 o’clock during the intercept. Essentially, pure pursuit occurs
with the fighter’s nose on the target. The radar depiction has the target
at zero azimuth and the SRM steering dot centered in the ASE circle. On
the HUD, the TD box is centered on the waterline.

AAM-2 D-10


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_17.jpeg:
Lead Pursuit

Lead pursuit (Figure D-9) is the situation where the fighter is attempting
to gain closure or increase aspect angle by predicting a future position of
the target aircraft and flying to that position (cut-off). Basically, the
fighter points his nose in front/ahead of the target aircraft. On the radar
display, the target is placed on the hot side. On the HUD, the TD box is
below the waterline (maybe at the bottom of the HUD). In flying a lead
pursuit curve, the fighter continuously changes heading toward the
target’s heading to maintain the target HOT of the nose. A turning rejoin
is flown using lead pursuit.

Figure D - 9. Lead Pursuit.

D-11 AAM-2


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_18.jpeg:
Lag Pursuit

Lag pursuit (Figure D-10) occurs when the fighter attempts to reduce
closure or decrease aspect angle. Essentially, the fighter points his nose
behind the target aircraft. On the radar, the target is placed on the COLD
side and on the HUD, the TD box is above the waterline. If lag pursuit is
employed too late or it is too extreme, a square corner is generated
causing a flight path overshoot.

AAM-02-10

AAM-2 D-12


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_19.jpeg:
Closure

Closure (Vc) is the angular velocity between two aircraft. It is displayed
on the right side of the radar display in knots. As aspect changes, so does
the displayed closure (aspect decreases, closure decreases; aspect
increases, closure increases). Since the intercept geometry is based on a
co-speed target, the target/fighter speed ratio is also important. If the
ratio favors the target, the intercept needs to be hotter (Figure D-11). If
the ratio favors the fighter, the intercept may be colder.

MEDIUM ALTITUDE INTERCEPTS
Intercept Types

There are two basic types of intercepts and a variation which combines
the elements of both (Figure D-13). First is the cut-off or collision course
intercept. This is generally used where minimum time to kill is desired.
The other is the stern conversion, which is used when other limitations
preclude a cut-off. Identification of the target may require a stern
conversion to be performed. The two together form the front MRM attack
with a stern reattack. This allows for a stern conversion should an MRM
attack fail or if there is a requirement to engage more than one bandit.

NOTE
For ease of interpretation, the following intercept discussions assume the

fighter has acquired a single contact on a co-speed, nonmaneuvering
bandit who is unaware of the fighter’s presence.

Approach Quadrants

In the intercept, there are four approach quadrants (Figure D-14) which
influence how we accomplish the intercept. Each quadrant is defined by
the displayed aspect angle. A head-on approach is in the 16 - H aspect.
The front quarter is in the 12 - 15 aspect. The beam approach is in the 7 -
11 aspect. The stern is in the T - 6 aspect.

Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_25.jpeg:
Cut-off/Collision Course Intercept

The cut-off or collision course intercept is the quickest course to weapons
employment and is also the easier of the two intercept types to fly. Once
you have found the target and have determined that a collision course
intercept is the type to be flown, you must determine the CATA. The
formula for a co-speed CATA is:

180° - AA = CATA

Once you have determined the CATA, turn to place the target on the
CATA. While on the CATA, aspect angle remains constant and the target
tracks at a constant azimuth. Outside of 1.2 aero, turning to center the
MRM steering dot in the ASE circle places the target on the CATA. At 1.2
aero, the steering dot transitions from aircraft-to-aircraft collision steering
to missile-to-target collision steering. Keeping the dot centered will result
in a turn into the target. At 10 seconds to go, the dot provides pure
pursuit.

As you can see, the collision course intercept is easy to fly and puts you in
the earliest position to employ ordnance. However, not all situations
allow the collision course intercept.

Stern Conversions

Should tactics or restrictions preclude the collision course intercept, a
stern conversion should be flown. The objective of a stern conversion is to
develop and maintain turning room and close to an ID and/or firing
position. There are three types of stern conversions flown: horizontal,
combination, and vertical. Each will be discussed in relation to the
approach quadrant.


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_26.jpeg:
Horizontal

The horizontal intercept is flown nearly level with the target and offers
some advantages. The turning room problem is simplified because the
turning room shown on the display is the turning room you have. Also,
since the intercept is basically two-dimensional, it is easier to track a
target with no lockon and easier to fly during night or IMC conditions.
However, there are some disadvantages. The fighter is easier to see and
defeat because he is level with the target. Also, the horizontal intercept
requires a lot of turning room (8-10 nm). The general parameters for a
horizontal intercept are sufficient turning room until pure pursuit is
established, 100-200 knots speed advantage until rollout, 50-100 knots Vc
at rollout with less than 9000 feet range.

Head-on Horizontal Intercept

The head-on horizontal intercept (Figure D-15) starts with aspect angles
from 16 - H. Since the fighter is on the target’s nose, more maneuvering
will be required to gain sufficient turning room. The procedures used to
accomplish the intercept are to offset the target 40-50° cold of the CATA
and counterturn to maintain the target at that azimuth, until establishing
the pure pursuit curve with a 15 AA at 20 nm, or 14 AA at 15 nm, or 13
AA at 10 nm. The later the target is acquired, the more aggressively the
aircraft must be maneuvered to gain the required turning room.

Front Quarter Horizontal Intercept

The front quarter horizontal intercept (Figure D-16) is flown from aspect
angles between 12 - 15. The good news is that turning room already
exists. However, the fighter must maneuver to keep the turning room
from becoming excessive.

AAM-02-16

Figure D - 16. Front Quarter Horizontal Intercept.

The procedures to follow are to place the target on the CATA until
intersecting the pure pursuit curve and then go pure pursuit; (i.e., lockon
shows a 14R AA at 35 nm - put target on CATA [40°L], go pure pursuit
when range decreases to 15 nm). Remember, once you put the target on
the CATA, it will be necessary to turn toward the target to go pure. Then
the turn direction will have to be reversed to maintain the target pure (on
the nose) until dead astern.

AAM-2 D - 22


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_29.jpeg:
Beam Horizontal Intercept

The beam horizontal intercept (Figure D-17) already has you in a position
requiring more of a chase down rather than the geometry doing the work.
The aspect angles are from 7 - 11. The CATA is off the display and
unusable without GCI. Therefore, airspeed coupled with some geometric
cut-off will be used to close on the bandit. The procedures to follow are to
accelerate to 200 knots speed advantage, displace the target 50-55° on the
hot side of the display, counterturn to maintain the target at that
azimuth, then go pure pursuit on intercepting the pure pursuit guide
(between 5-10 nm).

intercept; however, displacement should be less. Displace the target 72 AA
on the hot side of the radar display and accelerate. Establish pure pursuit
between 3-5 nm. Once again, airspeed is going to be your primary means
of closure.

Conversion Pursuit Guide

The conversion pursuit guide (Figure D-18) was developed as an aid in
determining the turning room available. If the fighter has a 16 aspect at
30 nm, sufficient turning room exists to allow the fighter to immediately
pure pursuit the target. Turning room exists at the points shown in
Figure D-18.

Pure Pursuit Conversion Turn

The pure pursuit conversion turn is based on ranges, aspects, and Vc used
to roll out at the target’s six, inside of 9000 feet, with positive Vc. The
table below lists the reference points. If your aspect/Vc is higher, allow
the target to drift slightly to lag (cold) and maintain until achieving a
reference point. If your aspect/Vc is lower, fly a lead pursuit curve until
reaching a reference point, then pure pursuit. Use these numbers to
check your progress during the final turn to the target’s stern and to
recognize the need to adjust to desired parameters.

Combination

Combination intercepts gain turning room in both the horizontal and
vertical. We can think of the intercept as either the chandelle or the slice.
The combination intercept has some distinct advantages. Unlike the
horizontal intercept, the combination gets the fighter away from the
target’s horizon and is therefore harder to see and to counter. The main
disadvantage is that night or IMC combination intercepts may not be
practical due to the maneuvering required. Normally, 5000-10,000 feet of
vertical (either high or low) turning room will be used. Since vertical
turning room is available, less horizontal offset is needed. As in the
horizontal intercept, there will be some Vc advantage carried throughout
the intercept, and the desired rollout is inside 9000 feet with positive Vc.
The pursuit guide below is adjusted to allow for the vertical turning room.

horizontal. The target is displaced while establishing 5000-10,000 feet
vertical separation, 30-50° cold of the CATA (depending on the amount of
vertical offset used); counterturn to maintain offset and establish pure
pursuit at the appropriate aspect angle and range.

Vertical

The third means of gaining turning room is to use vertical only. There are
two types of vertical intercepts: low to high and high to low. A key
advantage to the vertical intercept is that it is very hard to be seen by the
target. Additionally, attacking from high allows entering the fight with
maximum energy advantage, while attacking from below may mask your
aircraft from the target’s radar. The disadvantages are difficulty in
getting a tally looking high to low, potential square corner (high to low),
energy depletion on a low to high (negative Vc), and difficulty in flying no
lockon. Desired parameters are more than 10,000 feet vertical offset,
early tally (8-10 nm), pure pursuit conversion at 30° antenna elevation/
depression, and a rollout within 9000 feet with 50-100 knots Vc. Only two
approaches are discussed, as both the beam and stern tend to be the same
as the combination intercept.


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_36.jpeg:
Head-on Vertical Intercept

During the head-on vertical intercept (Figure D-22), increase aspect to as
close to a pure 180 as possible and achieve your desired vertical offset. At
a minimum, fly the CATA until you reach 30° antenna elevation/
depression, then pure pursuit. On a high to low, power is modulated to
control energy at rollout. On a low to high, throttles are in afterburner to
maintain energy. The front quarter vertical intercept is essentially the
same as the head-on.

Medium Altitude Intercept Summary

There are two basic types of intercepts flown: cut-off (collision course)
intercept and stern conversion. The collision course intercept is the easier
of the two, but it also makes up a portion of each stern conversion.

Table D-1 summarizes the three types of stern conversions flown. The
numbers shown are not the only possible combinations. As your
experience grows, so will your understanding of their relationship.

INTERCEPT STEPS, FLOW, AND ADJUSTMENTS

As in any task, the intercept can be subdivided into a series of steps which
result in the desired outcome. We call these steps the intercept flow (see
below).

The first step is to find the target. This is accomplished by using a
disciplined radar setup and search plan. Once the target is found, sample,
make a bearing, range, and altitude (BRA) call, and develop a
three-dimensional view of the intercept as depicted on the display.

Once accomplished, you can determine the intercept geometry and decide
on the type of intercept to be flown. Finally, maneuver for turning room
or to establish a collision course. This step needs to be accomplished at
longer ranges to minimize the degree of maneuvering required and to
deny the target an early tally. Remember, the Eagle is a large airframe.
Any maneuvering flashes the large wing and makes it easier for the
bandit to gain a tally. One of the more important steps is to get an early
tally on the bandit. Maneuvering against a target is much easier when
you perform it visually rather than with the radar. The last step of the
intercept flow is the endgame—why you did this in the first place. The
endgame consists of a medium range missile shot and/or conversion to the
stern for an identification pass or short range engagement.

Taking all this into consideration, the next concern is the flow or pacing of
an intercept. The intercept flows as follows.

Radar Setup/Search

We previously discussed the factors that might affect the intercept. We
will now discuss radar setup and search together since they complement
each other. The intent of this course is not to provide a book answer on
radar search techniques. There are no absolutes. The radar search plan
depends on the mission scenario, radar capability, radar modes available
for use, personal preference, etc. Some general considerations and
techniques follow.

Range

Range selected on the scope should cover the expected threat range. This
can be determined by intelligence, GCI, or area of responsibility. Threat
parameters must be considered (i.e., size, altitude, speed, etc.). A GCI call
near the selected radar display range may dictate a greater range be
selected to see a possible lead/trail formation.

Elevation Scan

The el bar scans selected most frequently are 4 or 6 bar. The time
required for an entire frame (one complete set of 4 or 6 bar) increases with
the number of bars. El bar scans may be briefed by the flight lead. Keep
in mind, if more bars are selected than required to cover the altitude
band, elevation sweeps are wasted above/below target altitude and frame
time is increased.

Azimuth (AZ)

Select an AZ scan as appropriate to cover the required airspace. Realize
that at 60 nm range, 60° of azimuth sweep equates to 60 nm of airspace
(across the display) being covered; 120° azimuth sweep results in 120 nm
coverage. Know the airspace width or area of responsibility and select the
appropriate azimuth scan. Excessive coverage in azimuth means an
unnecessary increase in the time to search a segment of airspace. On the
other hand, understand that at 15 nm, 60° sweep is only 15 nm across and
may not be enough to cover the threat airspace.

AAM-2 D - 34


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_41.jpeg:
Acquisition Symbols

Initially, set the acquisition symbols at the briefed range and cover the
altitude briefed by the flight lead. You are responsible for this coverage
even as you search for targets. As you look for targets without GCI, set
the acquisition symbols short of where you expect to pick up targets. For
example, expect to see a fighter size target at 40-60 nm, so set acquisition
symbols at 20-30 nm. With GCI, use them to lead GCI range (due to their
radar and comm lag); 3-5 nm should be sufficient. Move the acquisition
symbols as target range decreases.

Altitude Coverage

Set up your radar plan to search the expected threat altitudes; e.g., low for
strike aircraft or high for reconnaissance aircraft. Radar altitude coverage
displayed in search is a function of acquisition symbol placement and bar
scan. To ensure a systematic search pattern, the acquisition symbol
placement should reflect target range. Within the preplanned search
responsibility, search the extreme altitudes first. (If responsible for low
altitude coverage, search surface and up first.)

Indeed, this discussion is fairly generic. The most important aspect of
radar search is having a plan. The search plan should ensure that the
area of responsibility is covered in a systematic manner.

Find Target/Lock On

Be patient in locking on the target. Allow for two hits on the target
during search before attempting to lock on. Frequently, false targets
(known as “birds”) may show up on the radar. With the frame store up

(1 or 2), true targets leave a history. The false targets do not normally
show a history. There are two common techniques for lock on. The first is
to move the acquisition symbol slightly closer in range than the target and
push the TDC/full action to command mini-raster for lock on (i.e., lead the
target). The target will fly into the acquisition pattern. Another
technique is to move the acquisition symbol until it is over the target, then
command lock on. Either technique works; however, while gaining
experience in the aircraft, the first technique is more successful. Avoid
trying to lock on during a turn as this can be difficult, and there is a high
degree of uncertainty as to which target was locked during multiple target
intercepts.


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_42.jpeg:
BRA(A) Call

The BRA(A) report is used between GCI/AWACS and the fighter or
between the fighter and his wingman/leader. It is an abbreviated,
standardized format used to report target position. The BRA(A) report
can be relative to your aircraft or to a known geographical point (bullseye).

B is for bearing to the target (magnetic or relative).
R is for range to the target in nautical miles.

A is for target altitude.

(A) is for aspect angle.

The preferred BRA(A) uses magnetic bearing due to the inherent
positional errors associated with relative bearing. An example of a
BRA(A) report using Figure D-23 is “Jester 21, group (contact), one five
zero, twenty, twenty-one thousand, flanking north.” This differs slightly
from a BRA call made with search radar: “Jester 21, hit, one five zero,
twenty, medium.”

Develop Three-Dimensional View

Essential to understanding the geometry of any intercept is an awareness
of what the numbers on the radar display are telling you. As will be
stated many times in this course, there are but two radar intercept
objectives. Either establish a collision course and a close to front aspect
weapon parameters or build turning room (displacement from target
track) to convert to the stern. Using the target’s TAS and aspect angle,
establishing CATA should be easy. If the goal is to convert to the stern,
then the target aspect, altitude, and range indicate if sufficient turning
room exists or if more must be acquired. To build the “big picture,” the
radar presentation must be interpreted to what would be seen from a
“God’s Eye” view (Figure D-24). It is not necessary to draw out the radar
presentation on each intercept, but it is necessary to envision what is
happening. Hint: The TSD provides a very good “God’s Eye” view.

Determine Intercept Geometry

Once you have developed a “God’s Eye” view and know the type of
intercept you want, do what is required. Continue to think about the
factors that affect the intercept (sun, clouds, elevation, threat, rules of
engagement [ROE], etc.) as you maneuver for turning room or collision
course. You should accomplish this step at longer ranges in order to
minimize the degree of maneuvering required to deny the bandit an early
tally. The accepted standard is go pure pursuit NLT 10 nm. Remember,
the Eagle is a large airframe and maneuvering flashes the wing and
makes visual acquisition easier for the bandit. One of the more important
steps is to get an early tally on the bandit. Maneuvering against a bandit
is much easier when you perform it visually rather than with the radar.
The last step of the intercept is the endgame, which consists of a medium
range missile shot and/or the conversion to the stern for the identification
or the short range engagement.

Maneuver to Make Adjustments to Intercept

Turning Room

The maneuver to achieve offset for the appropriate aspect at a given range
may be thought of as a point-to-point. The amount of offset and direction
to go is dictated by the fighter’s present position in relation to the point
where the desired 10 nm horizontal offset is achieved; i.e., pure pursuit
curve. If you have an H or 17 aspect with sufficient range, then 40° offset
to the cold side may be acceptable. A 16 aspect at the same range may
only require 30° offset as shown in Figure D-25. A 16 aspect at 20 nm
gives fighter B approximately 6 nm of horizontal offset already
established. Fighter A (H aspect) has no turning room. Consequently,
since fighter B is closer to the desired horizontal offset, it does not need to
offset as much to the cold side. Range is significant in the equation for
offset. Figure D-26 shows that as range to the target decreases, a greater
amount of offset is required to get the horizontal turning room. Of course,
achieving some vertical displacement aids in gaining turning room for the
conversion (slice/chandelle).

Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_47.jpeg:
Realize that initial fighter maneuvering to establish turning room may
not be 100% effective. During the intercept, turning room status must be
constantly evaluated and ATA changed as necessary. Figure D-27 shows
two fighters. Fighter A is hot (does not have sufficient turning room) and
fighter B is cold (has too much turning room). Fighter A has closed to 20
nm and still shows a 17 AA. This equates to only about 3 nm of horizontal
offset. In BFM, this would be sufficient. The fighter could, in fact, convert
and roll out behind the target. However, the G loading required will be
high, maybe much higher than advisable in a WX/night situation. Also, at
altitude, G may result in excessive energy bleedoff and a rollout behind
the target with opening (negative) closure. To establish more turning
room, the fighter should turn to the right to displace the target farther left
(the cold side) on the display. Being hot does not necessarily mean the
intercept cannot be completed. It does mean that higher G will be
required to maintain pure pursuit. Fighter B is cold. If fighter B does not
maneuver left, the end result will be too much horizontal turning room.
This will translate to excessive range at rollout behind the target.

Pure Pursuit

Given that sufficient horizontal/vertical turning room has been
established, going pure pursuit is the actual process by which the fighter
is able to convert to the target’s stern (Figure D-28).

AAM-02-28

Figure D - 28. Pure Pursuit Timing.

In day VMC conditions, pure pursuit is normally taken no later than 10
nm in order to hide the aircraft and to gain an early tally. During
night/IMC that is not necessarily the case. Since there is no need to hide
the fighter, the pilot may elect to continue offsetting inside 10 nm range if
insufficient turning room is available. Realize that going pure at the first
opportunity will decrease offset without significantly generating turn until
short range. Just as in the discussion of turning room adjustment earlier,
a hotter intercept will require a higher G at endgame.

Airspeed

The fighter would like to roll out behind the target with positive overtake.
Figure D-29 shows recommended values for fighter airspeed when
reaching the “go pure” point for each type of intercept. The speeds given
are comparisons to target KTAS. These speeds should be set no later than
the pure pursuit point, but recognize that to establish a fighter airspeed of
target TAS +200 KTAS 30 nm before the pure pursuit point wastes JP-8.

Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_50.jpeg:
Fast Target

The fast target (Mach 1.1 or greater) poses problems when contemplating
a stern conversion. Offset sooner to establish lateral turning room. Due
to higher closure, offset the target farther to the cold side to assist in
building turning room. Increase fighter airspeed to approximately target
airspeed by the pure pursuit point. This will prevent rolling out behind
the target with negative Vc. Due to high line of sight rates presented by
the fast moving target, go pure pursuit at a 14 to 15 AA. Expect higher
than normal Vc on the pure pursuit schedule as a result of higher true
airspeed. Avoid the temptation to cool off the intercept by pulling back on
the power, as it will result in an energy deficient state behind the target.
Expect shorter weapon envelopes in the stern. Do not be lulled into
thinking that SRM employment is the only option. If outside SRM
parameters, think MRM.

Slow Target

The slow target profile generally assumes an aircraft of small radar return
moving at speeds much slower than normal fighter speeds. Slow targets
are often at low altitude. Placing the target on a high aspect approach
quadrant may be the only way to maintain lock for front aspect MRM
employment. Due to the target size, a VID may prove to be extremely
difficult before minimum range for weapon employment. Ifa stern
conversion is desired, offset at normal range or later and attempt a
look-up position (altitude permitting). Unless a 16 - H AA is seen on first
lock, the radar may have difficulty maintaining a lock. Expect to have to
reacquire the target several times during the intercept. Realize that, due
to its low airspeed, the target will not be moving down the display very
quickly. The vast majority of Vc will be attributable to the fighter. The
aspect angle will be very slow to decrease due to the low line of sight rate
of the target. Offsetting farther to the cold side will help. Due to low line
of sight, go pure pursuit inside 10 nm. If the fighter stays at tactical
airspeeds, expect high closure in the stern.

AAM-2 D - 44


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_51.jpeg:
Ve Control

This table shows range versus Vc for a co-speed horizontal intercept.
Closure and range should be cross-checked and evaluated to help
determine if a pure pursuit conversion is hot or cold.

RANGE ASPECT Ve
6 nm 10 700-800
5 nm 9 600-700
4 nm 7 500-600
3 nm 5 400-500
2nm 2 200-300
lnm T 100

If excessive Vc is displayed for the range (and the target is not at high
speed), then lag the target until Vc comes under control. If Vc is low for
target range, lead the target until values on the table match up.
Modulation of power may also be used to change Vc. If used, it should be
a small or momentary change. Too much or too long and you may end up
in a deficient energy state or with too much overtake. That covers the
basics of the intercepts. As with any part of air-to-air employment,
technique and personal preference play an important role.

Typical Intercept

An intercept consists of searching for the target, detecting the target,
sampling target parameters, sanitizing around the target, and then
sorting out the target formation in order to target the correct bandit.
After achieving the final lock, the stern conversion permits entry into the
visual arena from a position of advantage. Following the merge and the
conclusion of the engagement, a separation is performed in order to exit
the target area safely.

This section looks at the different phases, the tasks performed in each
phase, and the HOTAS to be used to perform those tasks.


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_52.jpeg:
In long range search, it is reeommended to utilize 80 nm, 4/6 bar el scan,
120° sweep and frame store of 1. Be patient with the search pattern if
using interleaved PRF. Do not move it until each bar has a high and
medium PRF sweep (for 6 bar scan, wait for 12 sweeps). Keep the
acquisition symbols short of the target’s anticipated range. Cover the
required airspace at the designated range. Use the numbers associated
with the acquisition symbols to cover the required altitude. Overlap the
altitudes as you move the coverage up/down in your search pattern. If you
know the threat’s approach axis, use of 60° sweep is a viable option to
decrease frame time.

Detection

After acquiring the target and confirming that the group is your target,
azimuth bump to 30°/60° sweep to increase the refresh rate of the hits.
Keep the acquisition symbols at least 5 nm short of the target. You are
looking for long range contacts that will enable you to get started on your
sampling, sanitizing, and sorting.

Sample

This phase is extremely important. The task is to determine intercept
geometry, develop a plan of action, and build SA through repeated
sampling in order to determine how many targets are in the group and the
parameters (altitude, aspect, range) of each target. This is also the time
to ID the targets. Sampling is performed by repeated locks of
approximately 5 seconds or just long enough to get valid target
parameters displayed and to read them. STT/TWS/highlight are options
for this phase.

Targeting
If there are multiple groups, the flight lead will determine the priority

group for the flight to target. The flight will then sort within the priority
group for final locks.

AAM-2 D - 46


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_53.jpeg:
Sanitize

During the sampling phase, sanitize the area around the target for brief
periods between the sample locks. If needed, move the search pattern to
other possible threat axes or altitudes. This must be done in order to
prevent unseen bandits from entering the engagement.

Sampling, sanitizing, and sorting are accomplished in a near
simultaneous fashion by highly experienced aircrew. Less experienced/
proficient aircrews need to consciously realize which task is the current
priority, so they can optimize the radar for that task. For sanitizing, a
wide search volume is required. For sampling or sorting, optimize the
radar against the observed target(s) or against the smaller volume of
airspace around the target formation. STT is a pure sample mode.
Search is the purest surveillance mode while offering some target
information. Highlight and TWS offer a compromise between sampling
and sanitizing. Search sort, high data TWS and TWS sort (particularly
HDTWS sort) provide the enhanced capability to address the sorting
problem.

Sorting

Once the airspace has been sanitized and target parameters are known, it
is relatively easy to lock the correct target. The final lock range will be
briefed and must be adhered to in order to enable all flight members to see
the same radar picture and therefore lock the correct bandit.

The sort will be briefed. In general, you take the bandit that corresponds
to your flight position. For example, wingman on the left takes the bandit
on the left. Wingman takes trailers. As a single, take the bandit on the
side you are converting to. For example, you see a 17R aspect and offset
the targets to the left (targets on the right [cold side] of the radar). Your
final lock should be to the target on the left. For lead/trail, lock the trailer
to prevent yourself from being sandwiched.


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_54.jpeg:
Intercept Geometry

If not already accomplished, after the final lock, position the aircraft for
the desired geometry. For cut-off geometry, center the dot and shoot at
the briefed range. For stern conversion, offset at the desired range and
monitor aspect angle and closure during the conversion. Go pure pursuit
NLT 10 nm and be prepared to shoot when the target is declared hostile.
Complete the intercept with the stern conversion and/or Fox 1/2/3 on the
bandits.

Intercept Results

There are four possible results from any intercept. The first is to attack
the bandit undetected. The second is when both the fighter and the target
see each other, which may result in a neutral start to the visual fight. The
third occurs when the fighter fails to see the target, but the target sees the
fighter. This results in either a kill by the target or a defensive
engagement for the fighter. The last is a missed intercept where neither
the fighter nor the target engage. The most important thing to remember
is that an intercept in itself is not the endgame, just a means to that end.
Always be ready to fight your best 1 v 1 BFM.

Separate

At the end of the engagement, turn to the called/briefed egress heading.
The pilot should select guns and position the search pattern to sanitize the
egress. Visually clear the area around the aircraft. Regain the briefed
formation and mutual support. After sufficient search in guns, go to SRM
and allow the WSO to take command of the radar. Go to MRM search
after sanitizing the short range area in front of the aircraft.

Be prepared to enter another engagement!

AAM-2 D - 48


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_55.jpeg:
HIGH ALTITUDE INTERCEPTS

High altitude intercepts present another unique problem. The target at
high TAS/Mach combined with the fighter aircraft turn performance at
altitude makes stern conversions impractical and a reattack not probable.
The head-on collision course intercept is the desired attack with an aspect
angle as close to H as possible to minimize missile maneuvering. One
method used in the F-15E community is as follows.

A/B climb to FL 350, accelerate to 1.3M
Increase aspect to H

At approximately Raero, center the dot
Shoot two missiles, five seconds apart

At 15 miles with 15 seconds missile TOF remaining, bunt to get
ready for the next target

Keep target illuminated for MRM time of flight—this may result
in high angle of attack and slow airspeed for the F-15E as the
nose is raised to keep the target inside elevation gimbals


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_56.jpeg:
LOW ALTITUDE INTERCEPTS

The low altitude intercept presents unique problems to the fighter. The
first problem is reduced target acquisition range both for the radar and
visually. The second is reduced missile envelopes and difficulty in
employing the gun. The target gains an advantage because the ground
becomes a threat to the fighter. In addition to ground impact killing the
fighter, the ground can cause the radar to break lock.

To counter the problems, fly a horizontal or a limited vertical combination
intercept. The conversion is started by 14 AA with a gradual descent to
avoid a square corner. Throughout the conversion, the fighter maintains
a speed greater than or equal to the target. An early tally is critical. Your
eyes are your most valuable tool. Look for shadows of the bandit to cue
you toa tally. Anticipate ridge lines because the bandit may highlight
himself crossing them or try to use them to hide from you. Task
saturation may very well become a problem. You still have to check six,
watch lead, and fly the jet. The biggest problem remains the ground.
Good crew coordination and directed crew responsibilities must be
established if you are to be successful and survive.

CREW COORDINATION

As you have seen in other lessons, most tasks in this aircraft can be
performed by either crew member. However, without prior coordination
the crew can find themselves fighting over control and not using this
aircraft to the maximum of its capabilities.

Radar
The radar (except for auto acquisition functions) can be controlled

effectively from either cockpit. In fact, there are specific mission tasks or
times when a particular individual must have control of the system.

AAM-2 D- 50


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_57.jpeg:
The closer you are to the ground, the more the pilot is concerned with
NOT hitting the ground and less with the radar. Therefore, the WSO
normally becomes the primary operator. Aside from those times when
radar control is task directed, the WSO normally operates the radar.
Short range engagements may dictate that the pilot have control of the
radar using the auto acq modes. While at longer ranges, either crew
member can successfully perform the functions.

The crew member not in control of the radar monitors the aircraft for
safety of flight and performs primary cockpit duties. He is responsible for
flight deconfliction and clearing for bandits. The bottom line is that if one
crew member is heads down in the radar, the other should be heads out
performing visual lookout and flight deconfliction.

Commentary

Intercockpit

Having two crew members in an airplane increases the capability to do
complex tasks, but it also increases the amount of communication
required on the intercom. Briefing key words for taking command and
changing command of tasking, as well as using accepted brevity terms,
cuts down on the amount of chatter in the cockpit. It is highly probable
that during the intercept the pilot will be looking out front or at the radar
and the WSO will be looking over his shoulder in an attempt to find the
bogey that GCI had said was following them, or keeping track of the rest
of the flight. Any change in situation demands intercockpit
communication. The longer a crew flies together, the better their crew
coordination will be. Nothing done by one crew member is unknown to the
other. Comments must be as brief as possible without causing confusion.
The key to successful intercockpit communication is crew coordination.
The key to crew coordination is talking about what can happen, what did
happen, how to prevent any unpleasant surprises, and those things you,
as a crew, did right.


Text from AAM-2_Intercepts_page_58.jpeg:
Intraflight

Once again, the goal is to limit the amount of communication to the
essential. Excessive talk only clutters up the frequency, confuses flight
members and may cause someone to miss a critical directive from lead or
ground control. There is nothing worse than losing a wingman because he
did not or could not hear your “break” call.

GCI/AWACS

It is the same problem as in intraflight. Be familiar with the brevity code
in AFTTP 3-1 and use it. Only the leader, or the aircraft responsible for
the intercept need acknowledge the GCI radio calls.

Visual Lookout

Visual lookout is the most important, single activity that will keep you
alive in any mission. On an intercept mission, the need for visual lookout
does not lessen as the attacker. In any fight it is the predictable aircraft
that gets beat. There is no other time when the crew is more predictable
than when flying an intercept. Someone in the aircraft must be clearing
at all times. Therefore, visual lookout is the responsibility of both crew
members. Additionally, periodic belly checks may be the difference
between being the shooter and getting shot. A rule of thumb would be
never turn more than 90° without making a belly check. AFTTP 3-1
covers the areas of responsibility for visual lookout. Key points to
remember are to clear the immediate threat area first, search both high
and low (a smart attacker avoids the horizon), and be disciplined in your
search.

TEXT
DEFINITIONS/TERMS

The radar is a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional event. The
information displayed on the MPD/MPCD air-to-air displays helps you to
develop the picture of the intercept geometry. The information covered in
RDR-2 discusses the air-to-air radar depictions. This text concentrates on
interpreting the information and employing the F-15E in the intercept
environment. Before discussing “how to,” the definitions of terms used are
discussed.

Intercept

An intercept is the means by which a fighter aircraft maneuvers from
beyond visual range to a position from which to employ ordnance, visually
identify the target, and/or enter the visual fight arena. The intercept can
be flown using GCI/AWACS information, on-board radar information, or a
combination of the two.

NOTE
Peripheral pushbutton legends and some air-to-air display legends have

been omitted from MPD/MPCD displays throughout the text for ease of

Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_10.jpeg:
Crew Coordination

The final, and probably the most important part of aircrew preparation
indigenous to the F-15E community is crew coordination. Having two
crew members in the jet to perform duties in the air-to-air environment
can be a decisive advantage or a hindrance, depending on how they
execute as a team. It is vitally important that the flight lead leave ample
time after the mission brief for crews to coordinate before they step to the
jets. Every crew brief should cover how the crew will handle the
“motherhood” items—the standard operating procedures of your particular
wing/squadron. But the emphasis of the brief should center around the
division of duties within your jet throughout all phases of the air-to-air
engagement. The brief must include how the radar will be employed.

Who will initially control the radar and when will control pass to the other
cockpit? Who is responsible for maintaining the “visual,” formation
position, and assigned altitude blocks? You also need to address how you
will employ the air-to-air interrogator (AAI), countermeasures dispenser
(CMD), and when to anticipate weapons employment. Once the agenda is
established, you must detail the division of labor. Many of the above
items may be “standard” for your squadron or a familiar crew, but still
must be clearly understood before you step. This drastically reduces the
amount of verbal communication required—both intercockpit and over the
radios. Obviously, the best laid plan will not work if there are no
disciplined communication procedures. The crew brief must establish who
will have primary control of the radios during what phase of the
engagement and when those roles will change. Of course, common sense
prevails if there is an emergency or dangerous situation developing. Then
it is everyone’s responsibility to avoid trouble. The bottom line is that a
disciplined intercockpit/UHF comm plan that emphasizes minimal,
concise, and pertinent transmissions will enhance everyone’s situational
awareness. A general game plan on how to handle emergencies could
make a potentially dangerous situation more benign.

AAM-3 D-4


Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_11.jpeg:
Flight Tasks

There are air-to-air flight tasks each aircrew is required to accomplish on
a typical medium-to-high altitude air-to-air mission. These tasks can be
divided into four separate phases: beyond visual range (BVR), from BVR
to the tally, merge, and postmerge.

Beyond Visual Range Task

The most important task to accomplish before any engagement is to
prepare yourselves and your jet. Ensure that you have done an extensive
FENCE check. Essential items to include in this check are the status of
your weapons, radar setup, CMD position, fuel state, and RWR operation.
Be sure that you have performed a good G warm-up. Accomplishing these
tasks prior to starting an engagement will alleviate the task saturation of
the actual fight. You must also have a briefed contract with your flight.
Depending on the tactics briefing, visual contact must be maintained
among the flight members. Anytime the “visual” is lost, a “blind” call
must be made and some sort of deconfliction plan within the block should
be executed. Ensure that all flight members fly their briefed formation
position. As the engagement begins, use GCI/AWACS to build your
situational awareness. Execute your crew-briefed game plan. Deviations
from this will require excess intercockpit chatter that will decrease
efficiency. A standard scenario for division of duties is for the WSO to
initially run the radar and avionics while the pilot maintains the visual,
formation within the block, and 6 o’clock coverage. The pilot must also
look down track for the tally-ho and possible contrails. Again, minimum
intercockpit communication is essential so as not to miss a safety of flight
or directive threat call. Remember, the most important concern is to keep
your flight path deconflicted from all players. If other tasks begin to
distract you from doing this, return to the basics and do not be afraid to
admit it.



Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_12.jpeg:
BVR to Tally

During this phase, the “big sky” is beginning to get smaller. More
emphasis should now be given to flight path deconfliction. It is common
procedure for the roles to change when the final sort is established. Ina
verbal exchange, the pilot should pass the visual to the WSO, take control
of the radar anticipating medium range radar shots, and use the HUD to
try and acquire the tally.

The WSO should acknowledge he has the visual, assume responsibility for
6 o'clock coverage, monitor shot parameters, and accomplish other tasks as
required. It is important to note that close proximity to the merge usually
incorporates timing out missiles, making kill calls, expending chaff/flares
and executing IRCM, all of which can reduce your overall situational
awareness. Do not get channelized on one specific task. As you convert on
the bandits, be vigilant for big altitude stacks, wide splits, trailers, or any
other bandit maneuvers. Endgame maneuvering in this environment has
the potential to infringe on training rule violations. Watch out for the other
guy and remember the basics.

Merge

This is the most demanding task phase of the air-to-air arena. Your
primary objective is to kill the bandit, but there are a lot of other variables
which factor into a successful engagement. All your attention must be
outside the cockpit now. When you see other players, do not assume they
see you. It is very easy to get channelized on your own flight and
disregard everyone else. It is also often difficult to discern if those other
players are offensively or defensively engaged. Fall back on your
crew-briefed procedures as to who is looking where. The pilot should be
out front while the WSO picks up “six” coverage and monitors the floor
transition. Do not blindly enter an engagement without having
situational awareness on where everyone is. If you become task
saturated, leave the fight. When the situation deteriorates with too many
airplanes in close proximity, a “knock-it-off’? may be appropriate.

AAM-3 D-6


Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_13.jpeg:
Postmerge

When it comes time to leave the fight, your tasking is far from over. Try
to get away from the merge as quickly as possible while using your short
range radar game plan to clear in front of you. Use your eyeballs
primarily to clear near threats. Again, fall back on your crew brief as to
who is clearing what side of the aircraft and high or low. Prioritize your
visual scan toward the merge then back to the standard visual lookout.
Extend in straight lines. Regain or maintain mutual support with your
flight, but do not sacrifice your own deconfliction to make it happen.
GCI/AWACS and intraflight communication can be invaluable to build or
regain situational awareness on egress. Once your flight is together and
on the way home, the engagement is over.

Low Altitude Environment

Up to now we have looked at air-to-air tasking in the medium altitude
environment. When you move your operations down close to the ground,
your tasks and priorities change. Your attention must be directed more
toward terrain clearance. This is a look at low altitude conversions and
their associated concerns.

Low-to-High Conversions

Low-to-high conversions require evaluation of both vertical and horizontal
maneuvering room. The optimum maneuver is a chandelle that uses both
vertical and horizontal offset to a low 6 o’clock position on the bandit,
striving to never leave his blind zone. The tally is usually not difficult to
obtain in this regime unless there is a significant altitude delta. The
pilot’s main concern down low is terrain avoidance, but requires less
attention in the conversion phase since the vector is away from the
ground.


Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_14.jpeg:
The WSO should watch terrain clearance at low altitude, maintain the
visual while alternately checking the radar, clearing 6 o’clock, and helping
to attain the tally. Although terrain avoidance becomes less of a
consideration once your vector is pointed toward the merge, there are a
couple of situations that deserve attention: 1) Do not attempt to square
the corner in the final conversion and end up nose high and slow at low
altitude. Overshooting with energy is a much better option. 2) After
operating close to the ground, 2000 feet AGL may give you the illusion of
being higher than you are. Do not be complacent; be aware of any
downward vector.

High-to-Low Conversions

GCI, AWACS, and radar will enable detection of low altitude threats.
BVR rules of engagement may simplify employment, but certain
situations will dictate conversions into the low altitude regime to employ
weapons. Target terrain masking, camouflage, and lost radar locks in the
final conversion are potential pitfalls. Do not let your zest to kill the
bandit preclude you from maintaining the “big picture.” The ground is
still your primary threat. Both crew members should be monitoring
descent rate, speed, and nose position while the WSO has more of an
opportunity to check six and maintain the visual. Attempt to get most of
your conversion turn out of the way early to minimize aggressive vertical
maneuvering down low at endgame. Plan your conversion to end up
slightly higher than the target’s altitude so an overshoot will not put you
into the ground. Letting your speed get out of control is a killer. Staying
high on the bandit will also allow for airspeed advantages for a tail chase.

Co-Altitude Intercepts

Terrain masking by the bandit will be more of a problem in this regime.
Predicting his new position may be the only option. The pilot should give
his undivided attention to the terrain and maintaining the tally while the
WSO clears six, works the radar, and maintains visual if required. The
radar should work fine in flat or slightly hilly terrain, but weapons
employment will be tougher in the low-to-low profile.

AAM-3 D-8


Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_15.jpeg:
Conversion Aborts

This is a major concern in high-to-low intercepts. Avoid a pure
high-to-low “split S” type conversion. Rolling more than 135° is not
advised. If at any time you exceed dive recovery safety parameters or the
conversion “feels” uncomfortable, roll wings level and recover. Both crew
members are responsible for maintaining terrain clearance, but the WSO
must be prepared to maneuver the aircraft away from the ground in case
of unforseen problems such as pilot spatial disorientation or a bird strike.

Flying tactical airplanes is inherently dangerous! As past mishaps prove
over and over again, flying in the air-to-air arena is even more dangerous.
You, the tactical aviator and brevet F-15E aircrew, can decrease your
chance of becoming a statistic while training like you are going to fight if
you follow the basic principles of preparation, and are cognizant of how to
maintain SA during critical phases of the air-to-air scenario.

TRAIL DEPARTURE
Purpose

The purpose of a trail departure is to get a flight of two or more airborne
when conditions do not permit a formation takeoff or rejoin out of traffic.
Wet runways, crosswind limits, stores configuration differences, low
ceilings, or poor visibility are normally the deciding factors. The flight
lead’s responsibility is to fly the published departure as briefed. The
wingman’s overriding priority is to MAINTAIN AIRCRAFT CONTROL
while flying the published departure and maintaining the briefed
separation from lead. The pilot should concentrate on instrument flying
while the WSO monitors the departure and attempts to get a radar lock
on the leader.

Before Takeoff

Prior to takeoff, review the departure and set up the radar. Have the
departure plate out and the navigation displays set up properly. All flight
members should listen carefully to the clearance and controlling agencies
for nonstandard or unpublished restrictions.

The following parameters give the best setup for the radar.

e A/Amaster mode (MM) selected. The HUD will have digital range
printout, but it will not have bank indices in the A/A MM. EADI
should be used for IMC conditions.

e Radar display options:
e Range: 10 nm A/A radar scope.
e Azimuth: 60° sweep (consider 30° sweep if the departure is
basically straight ahead).
e Bar scan: 4/6.

e Frame store: 1/2.

e ACQ symbols positioned at 1.5-2 nm.

AAM-3 D-12


Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_19.jpeg:
e = Elevation - set the antenna elevation approximately 5-8° high, or to
read field elevation and higher in the altitude data block. NOTE:
After the two-second weight off wheels transmitter 111 test, the acq
symbols reset to half display. The acq symbols must be brought back
to 1.5-2 nm and the desired elevation reset after this test is complete.

e AAT should be used to confirm that the radar target is your flight
member. Use correct code (CC) mode and auto AAI set to PDT or
STT. For two-ship trail, both lead and wingman can use the same or
different squawks. In a 4-ship, it is recommended to have a common
Mode 1 for the flight and a separate Mode 2 for each position to make
it easier to identify each flight member. The last member of the
flight will squaawk Mode 3 Code XX00, where XX is the first two
digits of the flight’s Mode 3; i.e., lead has 4212, four has 4200. AAT
does not require weight off wheels; therefore, wingmen can verify
proper AAI operation while taxiing to quick check or as preceding
flight members release brakes on takeoff roll.

Takeoff

Make a normal takeoff with 20 seconds spacing. This spacing gets lead
airborne before number two releases brakes.

After takeoff, the target normally appears at 1.5-2 nm. After establishing
a safe climb, attempt to manually lock on to the preceding aircraft. Once
the radar target is acquired, and while continuing to cross-check the flight
instruments, use manual or auto AAI to confirm contact on the correct
target. When assured of the correct radar target, say so on the radio,
“Call sign, TIED.” If this call is omitted, lead makes the calls required by
AFT 11-2F-15E.

The radar lock may be broken to clear the flight path. Use the AAI to
keep track of lead’s azimuth and range, reacquiring lock to check overtake
and aspect. Accelerate to the briefed climb airspeed, and set the throttles
to the prebriefed power setting. Part of the instrument cross-check
includes the closing velocity (Vc) on the A/A RDR/HUD. Vc gives an
additional cue to airspeed control.

Maintaining Trail

During constant heading segments of the SID, use small heading changes
to maintain zero aspect angle (AA) or tail (T) on the AA readout.
Wingmen may offset the preceding aircraft slightly to avoid jetwash.
Strong crosswinds cause the aircraft in front to be offset from the expected
no-wind position and the aircrew may notice a 10° left (1L) or 10° right
(1R) aspect when stabilized. A cross-check for TD box movement is useful
in detecting drift and when lead stops or starts a turn. Check lead’s
heading on the A/A RDR display and compare it to the SID.

Anticipate lead’s turns on the SID. To maintain trail in turns, the rule of
thumb is for 30° of bank, allow the target to drift 5° for each mile in trail;
i.e., 10° for two mile trail (Figure D-1). To maintain the briefed spacing,

use lead or lag pursuit while complying with the SID restrictions.

Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_21.jpeg:
If the lead aircraft is kept on the sync line, the Vc will be zero. If the lead
aircraft is allowed to drift to the left of the sync line (for a left turn), you
will be lagging and a negative Vc will develop. This will result in an
increase in range. If the lead aircraft is placed to the right of the sync
line, a positive Vc will develop resulting in a decrease in range.
Power/airspeed can be used, but is the least desirable means of
maintaining spacing because of the accordion effect on number three and
number four in a four-ship trail.

Fly the SID precisely and maintain appropriate altitude separation [AW
AFI 11-2F-15E if there are no radar contacts. Make all SID turns,
level-offs, and course changes. Fly good instruments, maintain airspeed,
follow the SID, and there will not be a conflict. Even without a radar
contact, lead should be within a few degrees and 2 nm of the nose when
breaking out on top of the clouds.

Loss of Radar Contact

If radar contact is lost, immediately notify lead. Continue to fly the SID.
The flight lead will call all turns and use 30° bank. In climbs or descents,
each aircraft/element will call passing each 5000 foot altitude increment
with altitude and heading. All members of the flight will call any
heading/altitude changes. Maintain 1000 feet altitude separation on
level-off.

The most common causes of “no contact” during the trail departure are not
flying the SID and not pointing the radar beam in the right direction
(azimuth and elevation). Once properly positioned, use a disciplined radar
search and the AAI.

AIR REFUELING
Mission Preparation

Prior to the flight brief, obtain the tanker call sign, refueling track,
refueling altitude block, fuel offload, refueling frequencies, and air
refueling control time (ARCT). Note the position, coordinates, and
TACAN fixes associated with the air refueling initial point (ARIP) and the
air refueling control point (ARCP). This data can be found in flight
information publications (FLIP) area planning (AP)/1B or local in-flight
guides.

Ground Operations

Check the aircraft forms to ensure the aircraft is air refuelable. After
start, ensure the slipway door opens and closes properly, and the air
refueling READY light and receptacle lights illuminate with the door
open.

En Route

Set up the radar controls to search the tanker’s altitude block. Maintain
the briefed position in the formation. Obtain the tanker’s Mode 3 IFF to
enable positive ID with the AAI. Ensure the master arm switch is in
SAFE. Set the correct altimeter setting.

Rendezvous Geometry

There are two methods of rendezvousing with the tanker: the point
parallel and the fighter turn-on.

Brief and use GCI to the maximum extent, but always monitor the
geometry to ensure an efficient rendezvous. Use the radar and A/A
TACAN to monitor the rendezvous geometry to detect deviations as they
develop (e.g., insufficient lateral separation or excessive heading crossing
angle). Maintain altitude separation with the tanker until visual and
complete the hot armament safety check prior to putting the tanker in the
lethal envelope for the weapons you are carrying. The wingman’s primary
responsibility is to maintain formation position. This is especially
important when acquiring a tally on the tanker. There is a great potential
for midair collision at this point, and all crew members must maintain
strict discipline to avert it.

AAM-3 D-18


Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_25.jpeg:
Point Parallel

Point parallel rendezvous (Figure D-2) is normally used anytime the
tanker has no aircraft refueling and the tanker is positioned at the ARCP.
Normally, radio contact is established with the tanker prior to arriving at
the ARIP. EMCON 2 is used as the normal air refueling communication
procedure IAW TO 1-1C-1-25. If both the tanker and receivers are on a
common GCI/FAA frequency, the change to the air refueling frequency
may be delayed until positive radar/visual contact is established. If under
radar control, obtain bearing and distance to the tanker prior to changing
to the air refueling frequency. As soon as reliable radio contact has been
established with the tanker, DME/radial information from a common
TACAN should be exchanged (if available). You must be cleared by the
tanker to depart the ARIP. Maintain 1000 feet below the tanker until
visual contact is made with the tanker.

Proceed from the ARIP to the ARCP using all aids necessary to maintain
the track. To provide range information, one flight member normally sets
the assigned A/A TACAN prior to the ARIP. All flight members normally
monitor the rendezvous on their own radars. If the rendezvous is
proceeding properly, lead tells the tanker to begin his turn to the refueling
heading at 26° azimuth on the radar at 21 nm range. A typical
rendezvous radar display is depicted in Figure D-3.

Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_27.jpeg:
The terminal stage of the rendezvous is critical. The point parallel
rendezvous with proper airspeed rolls the tanker out 3 nm in front of the
receivers. If the tanker turns too late or too slowly, an overshoot may
develop. If the tanker turns early or rapidly, a “cold” rollout (the tanker
more than 3 nm ahead of the receiver) results. During the tanker’s turn,
the tanker should be 34° left at 8 nm when halfway through the turn.
Refer to Table D-1 for a depiction of point parallel rendezvous data.

Se
[sme

Table D - 1. Point Parallel Rendezvous Data.

If range is less at a checkpoint, ease back on the power and advise the
tanker to push it up while performing a slight check turn away from the
tanker. If range is greater at a checkpoint, add power and turn slightly
toward the tanker. Checkpoints are based on the following conditions:

Tanker 275 KCAS/FL 280
Fighter 310 KCAS/FL 250

As a rule of thumb, changing fighter airspeed to 350 KCAS decreases
roll-out distance by 2 nm, thus allowing the fighters to roll out
approximately 1 nm behind the tanker. The critical factor is to ensure
altitude separation until established behind the tanker with visual
contact. Refueling airspeed is 310 KCAS, so the tanker is awaiting a
“push it up” call.

Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_29.jpeg:
Rendezvous Overrun

When a rendezvous overrun occurs, the tanker or receiver immediately
transmits a warning to all members of the flight and initiates rendezvous
overrun procedures. In the event of an overrun, the receiver(s) pass 1000
feet below the tanker to ensure positive vertical separation. The receivers
decelerate to 290 KCAS or buffet onset and maintain air refueling
heading. The tanker accelerates to 355 KIAS (3850 KCAS) or Mach 0.90,
whichever is lower, and maintains air refueling heading. When the
tanker is in positive visual contact ahead of the receiver, the receiver so
indicates. The tanker decelerates to air refueling airspeed and normal
closure procedures are employed to establish contact.

Prerefueling Checks

Follow procedures detailed in TO 1-1C-25CL-1 (“BRITTS” check: Beacon,
Radar, IFF, TACAN, TEWS, Slipway). Basically, ensure all forward firing
ordnance is safe and all aircraft systems which emit electrical signals are
in a standby mode (emissions limiting [EMIS LMT] is available). Set up
the fuel panel as briefed. As the flight approaches the tanker, the
refueling boom operator initiates a radio check which must be
acknowledged by each flight member (emissions control [EMCON]

option 1).

Refueling positions, refueling techniques and abnormal/emergency
procedures are discussed in AFTTP 3-3.

Postair Refueling

Complete the postair refueling checklist and check the fuel gauge to
ensure receipt of the proper amount of fuel and correct distribution in the
tanks. Flight formation after refueling is as briefed. Once the flight
departs the tanker and in-flight conditions permit, mentally transition to
the upcoming mission phase. Reset switches as necessary, and prepare for
the FENCE check. Simple mistakes such as entering an engagement with
the master arm in SAFE are more prevalent following in-flight refueling.

After Landing
Write up any discrepancies in the air refueling system noted during the
mission. Be sure to enter the in-flight refueling offload in the Air Force

Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781. Prior to shutdown, open the slipway
door and leave it open for maintenance postflight inspection.

TEXT
A/A ENVIRONMENT

Operating in the air-to-air environment is hazardous due to the many
different variables in the air-to-air equation. Other aircraft, high G turns,
and aircrew pride are just a few of the variables which make the air-to-air
environment so dynamic. The F-15E has an advantage over single seat
aircraft in that the two crew members can help accomplish the multitude
of required tasks or detect unplanned flight deviations. Although the
F-15E has an outstanding flying safety record, the air-to-air environment
remains an extremely dangerous place for the unprepared aircrew.

Preparation

Before ever strapping on the jet for an air-to-air engagement, the aircrew
must prepare themselves both physically and mentally. This preparation
process can be broken down into three main areas: physiological

preparation, systems knowledge, and crew coordination.

Physiological Preparation

Today’s fighters have the ability to exceed human performance
capabilities. Usually you strap in and go fly to the edge of the
performance envelope without experiencing any problems. However, if
you neglect to physiologically prepare yourself for flight, you will find
yourself repeatedly behind the airplane. Physiological preparation
revolves around your physical, psychological, and pathological condition.


Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_8.jpeg:
Physical

To maximize your physical status you need to eat properly and ensure you
are properly hydrated. You need at least 1200 calories per day to
maintain performance at an adequate level. You should eat at least two
meals each day, one of which should be breakfast. A poor diet will result
in fatigue problems, including muscle fatigue, which will seriously affect
your G tolerance. Dehydration also has a negative effect on your G
tolerance and induces early fatigue. One way to try to ensure proper
hydration is to drink water before flights, during flights (if possible), and
after flights. The best way to monitor hydration status is by the color of
your urine. Ifthe urine is very yellow, you are dehydrated. You should
drink water and avoid dehydrating agents like alcohol, coffee, and teas.
Try to exercise on a regular basis to enhance physical status. Limited
aerobic training (two or three times a week) combined with weight
training (two or three times a week) will prepare you for the strenuous
air-to-air environment.

Psychological

The psychological component is tougher to prepare. Some stress in our
lives is good because it improves performance. However, if there is a large
amount of stress in your life you will find your performance will suffer.
You will find you are more easily distracted, less attentive to your in-flight
duties, and much more susceptible to attention problems like channelized
attention, task saturation, and complacency. If you feel good physically,
but are unsure of your psychological status, you must ensure a thorough
preflight mission planning session to prepare for any unusual events that
could surface during the mission. By planning for the unusual you will be
ready to respond should the unusual actually occur. If you are under
extreme stress, fatigued, and find your thought processes slow and
uncoordinated, take yourself off the flying schedule for a short while until
you are in better shape to fly.

AAM-3 D-2


Text from AAM-3_Air-to-Air_Mission_Tasks_page_9.jpeg:
Pathological

Pathological status refers to whether you are healthy or sick. Flight
doctors and physiologists tell you not to fly when you are sick because you
might develop ear blocks and/or sinus blocks. Sickness dulls the senses,
reduces situational awareness, and slows your reactions—just what a
fighter aircrew member does not need. Do not self-medicate in an attempt
to feel better for the flight. This action is prohibited by flight doctors,
physiologists, and especially Air Force regulations. If you are sick, go to
the flight surgeon and let the doctor decide whether you should fly or not.
Do not try some nonprescription “miracle drug” to make you “feel good”
long enough to complete the mission. You are only asking for a possible
problem that could end your career.

By working to ensure you are physiologically prepared to fly, you will not
only enhance flight safety, but also see improved personal performance.
Before each briefing take a minute to check your physical, psychological,
and pathological status (kind of a human body preflight check). If
everything checks out good, go fly, fight, and win.

Systems Knowledge

Another integral part of aircrew preparation is thorough knowledge of the
aircraft systems. Although the F-15E is a very forgiving airplane, past
mishaps have shown that when aircraft or configuration limits are
exceeded the jet can become susceptible to departure, go out-of-control,
and be unrecoverable depending on altitude, energy state, and proximity
to the ground. It is essential that the aircrews know and adhere to all
F-15E Dash 1 restrictions and limitations. They must also be intimately
familiar with Section III of the Dash 1 concerning emergency procedures.
An out-of-control aircraft or other critical emergency situation requires
timely and proper procedures to safely recover the aircraft. By studying
and staying current with the Dash 1, aircrews will be more aware and
better prepared for all contingencies.

AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_10.jpeg:
The advantages of manual radars are that they are mobile and are excellent at the
merge. Their disadvantages are limited range, limited low level coverage and
susceptibility to electronic countermeasures.

Automated Radars (SOCC/ROCC)

Automated systems are usually located at major command centers. They receive and
display radar/communications information in their area of responsibility or sector
from various sources including manual radar sites and AWACS. Among their
responsibilities and mission capabilities are high level command and control,
establishment of a regional combined air picture and the evaluation of command
threats. They also perform normal air-to-air control.

Automated systems are operating or planned throughout the world. These systems
include Sector Operating Control Centers (SOCCs) and Region Operating Control
Centers (ROCC). You may recognize some of these by their call signs:

SOCCs

“Huntress” Griffiss AFB, NY

“Bigfoot” McChord AFB, WA

ROCC

“Top Rock” Located at Elmendorf AFB, AK; “Top
Rock” is responsible to
Alaskan/NORAD region

“Oak Grove” or “Cypress” Tyndall AFB, FL

Since automated systems are comprised of a net of manual radar sites within their
sector or area of responsibility, they provide a “Big Picture” capability for ACC, 11th
Air Force and NORAD for strategic aerospace defense. The range of automated radar
is the sum of the manual site locations. Each SOCC controls its own sector and
collectively the SOCCs cover the entire continental United States and Canada.

AAM-4 D-4


Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_11.jpeg:
The computerized automatic tracking system tracks and displays large amounts of
information; however, its digitized displays are not good for close-in control. These
digitized displays can be as much as 5 miles off in range.

In addition to standard radios these automated systems are equipped with digital
information links which receive and combine data from AWACS and land based
components. Automated radars are also HAVE QUICK capable.

The advantages of automated radars are their long range, their command and control
services and their resistance to electronic countermeasures. Their disadvantages are
that they are poor at the merge, have limited low level coverage (radar input
dependent), are computer dependent and are restricted to fixed locations.

AWACS

The airborne warning and control system (AWACS) is a mobile GCI site located
inside a specially modified 707-320B designated the E-3. The AWACS provides
radar coverage while ground sites are relocating or are otherwise out of service. The
AWACS’s high perch behind the FEBA also provides a more advantageous view of
the battle.

The AWACS operates at around 30,000 feet MSL behind the FEBA. Depending on
altitude, the AWACS can see fighter size, low altitude aircraft at more than 200 nm.
Bomber size targets at altitude can be picked up in excess of 300 nm.

The AWACS has a pulse/pulse doppler radar, which has very little ground
interference. The AWACS’s electronic countermeasures resistance is enhanced by
sidelobe suppression. The major disadvantage of the AWACS’s radar display is that
data presented on the controller’s screen uses large computer generated symbols.
These large symbols make working fighters inside 10 nm very difficult.

D-5 AAM-4


Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_12.jpeg:
The AWACS has a capability for ADF, secure voice, data link, HAVE QUICK and
HF communications. Although the AWACS has a total of 14 radios, they are shared
by the entire aircraft so the actual number of radios available for GCI varies. The
number of frequencies available also varies with the level of HAVE QUICK used by
the AWACS. HAVE QUICK originally used six of the twenty presets on a HAVE
QUICK UHF radio and created some delay in changing working frequencies. Later
versions freed up these frequencies and are much quicker to change. AWACS also
provides a direct line to the command authorities at the CRC.

The advantages of the AWACS are their long range surveillance, mobility, low
altitude coverage and electronic countermeasures resistance. Their disadvantages are
that they are limited at the merge, have limited communications and are
aircraft/computer dependent.

What is the most forward TACS component?

Where is it located?

What is the major disadvantage of the AWACS’s radar display?

D-7 AAM-4


Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_14.jpeg:
ANSWERS

1. | GCT’s stateside role is to detect and identify aircraft infringing upon U.S.
airspace.

2. | GCI’s overseas role is to assist in the offensive counter air tasks of sweep and
force protection and in the defensive counter air tasks of force or base
protection.

3. | The forward most TACS component is the forward air control post (FACP).

4. The FACP is located about 50 miles from the FEBA.

5. | The major disadvantage of the AWACS’s radar display is that its displays use
large computer generated symbols, which make working fighters inside of 10
nm very difficult.

AIRCREW/WEAPONS DIRECTOR RESPONSIBILITIES

The interface between the WD and aircrew is based on some general assumptions that
both of you must follow. You must know the wartime authentication process.
Further, you must know theater and regional airspace control procedures. You must
also know current tactics and capabilities of the threat. A complete understanding of
the states of alert, the readiness and warning systems and the appropriate rules of
engagement/training rules (ROE/TR) prepares you to use the system to its best
advantage. Finally, you must be familiar with the capabilities and limitations of the
communications, control facilities and other weapons systems that may be employed
for accomplishment of the mission.

Commit authority is subject to OPords/OPlans, command authority, ROE, commit
criteria and force commander direction. The flight leader also has the authority to
commit for the flight’s defense or when WD saturation dictates. In circumstances
where the fighter initiates a commit, the flight will inform the WD and provide the
WD with bearing and range to the target. When a flight informs a WD of a commit,
the WD will check to ensure the commit is on an appropriate target, and assist as
necessary. If the situation dictates that the commit be terminated, the WD will
transmit “SKIP IT” and give appropriate directions. The “SKIP IT” call is directive,
and the aircrew will disengage unless doing so will jeopardize the flight; in which

Continuum of Control

The continuum of control, Figure D-2, covers five levels: close, tactical, broadcast,
advisory and autonomous. There is no correlated format of target information to the
level of control. Situational awareness (SA) determines where the aircrew or WD
might be along the continuum. Transition between levels may occur rapidly and
continuously throughout any mission. The continuum allows maximum use of both
the aircrew’s and WD’s SA while minimizing missed weapons employment
opportunities due to a fixed control structure.

Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_17.jpeg:
Regardless of the level of control the WD and aircrew have standard responsibilities.
At all levels the WD must:

provide a situation brief (PICTURE) as time permits;

define the commit objective (KILL or ID);

provide threat and potential threat information (numbers, formation,
altitude, heading, speed);

commit fighters on the highest priority target;

monitor the intercept/engagement and provide vectors and/or bearing and
range to the target in the event the fighter loses contact on the target; and
monitor the area of responsibility for new targets, and, when necessary,
skip the current engagement and recommit fighters to higher priority
targets.

At all control levels the aircrew must:

position the aircraft and flight as necessary to accomplish the mission;
acknowledge target information as the situation permits;

notify the WD if contact is lost on a target being attacked;

call previously unreported contacts (BRA report, i.e., bearing, range,
altitude);

report essential elements of information (EEI);

report mission results;

advise the WD of fighter status; and

comply with WD directions to “SKIP IT” unless doing so will jeopardize
the flight.

D-11 AAM-4


Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_18.jpeg:
Close Control

Close control provides the greatest degree of WD control in the continuum. It can
vary from simply providing intercept vectors to providing detailed control requiring
specific altitude, speed and heading of the fighter. The use of this control may be
dictated by the mission, or initiated by the aircrew. The aircrew requests detailed
close control by transmitting “GO CLOSE CONTROL,” or, if only vectors are
required, by transmitting “WECTORS.” The WD transmits “UNABLE” if unable to
provide this control when requested.

In addition to all of the applicable common tasks, the WD supplies vectors as briefed
or based on appropriate tactics. Tactics used should be as briefed unless armament,
environmental conditions, target altitude or ROE dictate the use of another tactic.
Altitude, speed and direction are given, if necessary, for battle management or other
command/control reasons. The aircrew completes all of the applicable common

tasks, and then complies with WD directives, or requests “VECTORS.” Close control
may be entered from another level of the continuum by transmitting “GO CLOSE
CONTROL.”

Close control dialog between a flight and GCI/AWACS might take this format:

! Fighter call sign.

! Objective (KILL or ID). Once this is acknowledged, it is not repeated
unless it changes.

! Target position is given in bearing and distance. Bearing is given in three
digits “ZERO NINE ZERO,” and distance is given in whole numbers
“TWENTY-TWO.” “ESTIMATE” is used if the information cannot be
accurately determined. If a “BULLSEYE” or grid system is used, that
information must also be included.

! Target altitude is given in feet or in the AFTTP 3-1 bands, e.g., LOW,
MEDIUM, HIGH, (see Appendix G).

! Flight size and formation is given, e.g., “HEAVY, LINE ABREAST.”

! Target heading/maneuver. Heading given in cardinal direction. Tactical
maneuvers given in clear, concise transmissions: “BANDITS SPLIT,
FLANKING.”

! Threat type/role if known.

! Other specific observations “SLOW,” “FAST.”

Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_20.jpeg:
Tactical control enables maximum use of aircrew and WD radar SA to accomplish the
mission. The WD is not responsible for vectors or intercept geometry. Tactical
control provides the aircrew with target information and commit objective. This is
the standard employment level for operational and training missions.

Aircrew procedures: Communicate to support the SA of all players. Keep the WD
informed of status and intentions. Call sign usage is critical.

WD procedures: Keep aircrews informed on all situations affecting their mission or
execution. Listen.

Broadcast Control

Broadcast control is a means for WDs to support air operations in a covert, saturated
or low SA environment. It is informative and not directive in nature. Target
information is not addressed to a specific aircrew and is passed by referencing a
designated location or grid system. Upon implementation, aircrews should call when
committing, using the BULLSEYE or grid system reference, to enhance the
coordination among fighters on the same frequency.

Broadcast control information is prioritized in the following order:

! Track designation, e.g., BANDIT, BOGEY, GROUP,

! The reference system in use, e.g., BULLSEYE, a geographic reference or a
grid name,

! The bearing and range from reference to target,

! Target heading,

! The estimated number of targets if applicable or known.

When transmitted, this information might sound like, “BANDIT; BULLSEYE; TWO
FIVE ZERO, TWENTY; NORTHWEST; HEAVY.”

AAM-4 D-14


Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_21.jpeg:
A grid system is another reference system used in some theaters. The information is
the same as for other types of broadcast control. However, the area designator and
grid sub-sector replace BULLSEYE information. An example on broadcast control
using a grid system is shown in Figure D-3.

Advisory Control

If the controlling agency loses their radar, shuts down their radar to avoid attack, loses
effectiveness due to countermeasures, or the fighters are outside radar coverage, the
WD goes to advisory control. Advisory control is a radio monitoring mode where the
WD maintains communications with aircrews either directly, through a radio relay or
through another agency or facility. Advisory control allows command authorities to
monitor the air battle, manage fighter flow, pass intelligence, direct aircraft and move
CAPs. The WD indicates that he is operating in the advisory control mode by
transmitting “MIDNIGHT, MIDNIGHT.” The WD still passes available information
on threats, friendly forces, command decisions and other information requested by the
aircrews when able. As in broadcast control, aircrews are responsible for calling
“CONTACT,” “COMMIT” and “ENGAGED,” to keep the WD and other fighters
informed.

Autonomous Control

Autonomous control is used any time the aircrew cannot receive information or
guidance from the controlling agency. This may occur when communications are
lost, degraded or when the fighters are operating outside of the radio coverage.
During autonomous control, which is not preplanned, both the aircrew and WD are
responsible for attempting to reestablish communications and continue making calls
in the blind until communications are reestablished.

Control Considerations

When the aircrew/flight lead checks in, regardless of the level of control, he contacts
the GCI net with his call sign and any deviations/aborts that will affect the fragged
(scheduled) mission. The WD then authenticates (if necessary), and provides a
working frequency to the aircrew. This is also time to give situation briefs
(PICTURE) and IFF/SIF checks. The working WD will be on the working frequency.
The working WD needs to know your armamentByou can respond by giving “as
FRAGGED,” if your armament load is the same as what was briefed for the mission.
If your armament is other than what was briefed, you should give the number of each
type of missile using RADAR and HEAT as appropriate to indicate the type of
missile. RADAR indicates AIM-120 or AIM-7 and HEAT indicates AIM-9 missiles.
You do not need to report the number of 20mm rounds on board, if you have enough
20mm to “COMMIT,” then just state “GUN.”

AAM-4 D - 16


Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_23.jpeg:
Finally, give your fuel state in time on station (in minutes). An initial check-in should
sound like this:

Fit Lead: “DRAGNET, BRUTE 21, 160 AT 60 OFF SEYMOUR
JOHNSON.”
GCI: “ROGER BRUTE 21, DRAGNET HAS RADAR

CONTACT. WHAT STATE?”

Fit Lead: “BRUTE 21, LEAD HAS 4 RADAR, 4 HEAT, GUN,
PLUS 50 MINUTES.”

Return to base (RTB) procedures are the same regardless of the type of control used.
The type of conflict and theater of operations determine the controlling agency’s
priorities and the urgency of recovering fighter aircraft. On initial contact with the
controlling agency, aircrew will give their call sign and recovery base. As conditions
permit, the WD then provides recovery instructions to include base status, copies
in-flight reports, assists in minimum risk procedures and accomplishes a hand-off to
the receiving agency.

Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_25.jpeg:
ANSWERS
Close control

In tactical control aircrews are provided with target information and commit
objectives, but not vectors.

Broadcast control
Advisory control is a radio monitor mode used when the controlling agency
loses radar, shuts down radar to avoid attack, loses effectiveness due to

countermeasures or the fighters are outside radar coverage.

The WD informs you that advisory control is in effect by transmitting
“MIDNIGHT, MIDNIGHT.”

You use autonomous control anytime that you cannot receive information or
guidance from the controlling agency.

OPERATIONAL BREVITY CODE

The operational brevity words in AFTTP 3-1, Volume 1 are the baseline for
communication procedures. This code is a collection of succinct phrases or
individual words used to convey a more complex message in the tactical environment.
It is important that you have a working knowledge of the brevity code that is found in
AFTTP 3-1. Here are some examples:

BENT Identified system inoperative
BUZZER Electronic communications jamming
FADED Previous radar contact is lost
GADGET Fire control radar

HOLDING HANDS Aircraft are in visual formation

LOW Target altitude below 10,000 feet AGL
SNAP Request for immediate vector to target

GCI/aircrew communications join these words, e.g., BENT GADGET means
inoperable radar. A GCI conversation using the brevity codes might sound like this:

GCI: EAGLE 21 WHAT STATE?
(Translation - What type and how much
ordnance and fuel do you have left?)

Aircrew: EAGLE 21 IS WINCHESTER, BINGO, AND
RTB!
(Translation - I do not have anymore radar
missiles, heat seeking missiles or bullets. If I
stay here another five minutes I will run out of
gas and have to walk out; Iam going home!)

AAM-4 D - 20


Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_27.jpeg:
A directive commentary (from WD during close control) or set of standard phrases
are used with some brevity codes, for example:

Heading is given as “VECTOR XXX” in three digits.

Altitude is “MAINTAIN FLIGHT LEVEL.”

Speed is “MAINTAIN MACH POINT X” in Mach number.

Geometry selection, if given, will be “CUTOFF” (fastest course to target),
“STERN?” (roll out behind target), or “PURSUIT” (heading to bogey).

! Turn direction: Left or Right.

In combat, communication with GCI is critical; it must be clear, concise and to the
point. By using the brevity code, you say it all.

AIR-TO-AIR TRAINING RULES
Brief and Debrief Requirements

For normal day-to-day training, briefings and debriefings will be accomplished
face-to-face. When face-to-face briefings and debriefings are either not practical or
possible, telephonic briefings must be conducted. When circumstances prevent
face-to-face or telephonic briefings, airborne briefings may be conducted.
MAJCOMs may authorize alternate briefing procedures for unusual circumstances.

Face-to-face and telephonic briefings should cover the items in the air-to-air
coordination/briefing guide shown in AFI 11-214. The briefing should include, but is
not limited to: working area, scenario, tactics, training rules, “KNOCK-IT-OFP”
criteria, alternate missions, rendezvous and emergencies.

Debriefings will critically assess mission execution. Debriefings are also a very good
place to discuss expanding/changing roles with the WDs to increase their awareness
of air-to-air operations.

Airspace
Training will be conducted in designated airspace. Avoiding lateral airspace spillouts
is a joint WD/aircrew responsibility. Avoiding vertical spillouts is the sole

responsibility of the aircrew. Supersonic flight will only be accomplished in
designated supersonic areas.

AAM-4 D-24


Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_31.jpeg:
Training Responsibilities

The WD is responsible for advising aircrews of any previously unreported aircraft
within 10 miles that are a potential hazard. This information should include the
bearing, range, heading and altitude of the aircraft (if available). The WD must also
advise the aircrew any time that the controlling agency cannot support at least
broadcast control, in which case the aircrew may elect to continue the attack provided
he can provide safe separation. The WD is also responsible for making periodic
“CHECK FUEL” advisories to assist aircrews in fuel awareness. The WD advises the
aircrew when approaching airspace boundaries and provides other pertinent
information, such as airspace changes, weather in the working areas, and system
degrades. Unless prebriefed to the contrary the WD will make the following calls:

! Vectors to position aircraft to set up activity.
! Advise aircrews of Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA).
! A range call at 10 nm from any merge.

The aircrew is responsible for acknowledging all WD airspace and safety-related calls
and staying within the confines of the designated training area.

Training Rules

Training rules (previously called ROE or training ROE) are peacetime rules,
procedures and standards governing air-to-air training that, when violated, jeopardize
flight safety. They should not be confused with rules of engagement which are
specific constraints applicable to operational real-world peacetime, wartime and/or
contingency mission employment. Training rules are listed in AFI 11-214. Rules of
engagement are found in OPlans, contingency plans or other operational documents.

Separation of Aircraft

Hard altitudes or altitude blocks will be assigned to provide vertical separation for
nonvisual setups. A minimum of 1000 feet vertical separation (500 feet vertical
separation below 5000 feet AGL) between altitude blocks is required.

D-25 AAM-4


Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_32.jpeg:
Fighters may not transit or enter the altitude block of any adversary unless the
adversary is:

!
!

beyond 10 nm;

within 10 nm, but not a conflict (i.e., collision potential), based on
situational awareness;

in visual contact; or

fighter verbally confirms the adversary’s altitude and maintains required
vertical separation. Each participant must use “see and avoid” techniques
to ensure his flight path is clear. Any attacker losing sight will maneuver
away from the defender’s last known position. If a defender loses sight
and SA, he will maneuver predictably.

No friendly aircraft will be maneuvered within minimum range of another friendly
aircraft. Minimum range is found in MAJCOM or service directives.

Termination criteria listed in AFI 11-214 apply to air-to-air training. MAJCOM
supplements address specific separation requirements for day and night/weather
operations. The following are examples of termination criteria:

Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_33.jpeg:
Terminate Versus Knock-it-off

Terminate and knock-it-off mean the same thing, but they vary in scope. Terminate
applies to an individual aircraft or flight, but knock-it-off applies to all participants. If
any flight member, WD or ACMI RTO perceives a flight safety hazard, the call
“knock-it-off” will be made, at which time all participants will cease maneuvering

and acknowledge with a call sign. If any participant wants an individual aircraft or
flight to cease maneuvering, clearly identify the aircraft or flight and transmit
“TERMINATE,” followed by a wing rock if conditions permit. The aircraft/flight
will stop maneuvering and acknowledge with a radio call and wing rock if conditions
permit. If any doubt or confusion exists, or safety is jeopardized, use a
“KNOCK-IT-OFF” call so that all participants will immediately cease maneuvering.

MANEUVERING CATEGORIES

To ensure flight safety, a specific level of maneuvering is used to comply with
training rules. There are four maneuvering categories listed in AFI 11-214 for use
during air-to-air training missions. These categories are unlimited, limited, restricted
and nonmaneuvering.

Unlimited

In the unlimited category there are no restrictions except those of the aircraft flight
manual operational limits. Unlimited maneuvering requires you to be above 5000 feet
AGL in day VMC with a discernible horizon.

Limited

During day visual air-to-air operations when descending below 5000’ AGL or
conducting operations below 5000’ AGL, limited is the maximum maneuvering
category. Limited maneuvering is to be used at night or if encountering weather not
meeting cloud clearance or horizon requirement. Limited maneuvering is the same as
unlimited except for the following constraints:

! A defender may react to an attacker with an extension/separation and/or
turn not to exceed 180° after the attacker crosses the defender’s 3/9 line.

! Attackers engaging each other may turn 180° maximum in an attempt to
shoot each other.

! Attackers engaging defenders may turn until the defender terminates the
engagement, a kill is achieved or the defender turns 180°.

Restricted

Restricted maneuvering allows you to make heading changes of up to 60° either side
of course.

Nonmaneuvering
Nonmaneuvering requires that you maintain a constant heading, airspeed and altitude.

Maximum maneuvering during air-to-air training is based on meteorological
conditions (day/night/weather), altitude and configuration.

TEXT

This lesson is your guide to the radar systems available to you in the intercept
environment. It describes GCI and AWACS and the various amounts of information
they provide, and then discusses AFI 11-214 procedures and responsibilities you and
the GCI/AWACS weapons director (WD) need to know to achieve maximum
effectiveness. Next, it discusses the language of GCI, the operational brevity code
system, which allows you to communicate complex ideas with short code words.
Lastly, it discusses the separation and termination criteria and maneuvering categories
used both in practice and real intercepts.

GCI/AWACS CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS

There are several types of ground control intercept (GCI) operations as well as
airborne warning and control system (AWACS). They range from a single manual
radar site to sophisticated automated systems. GCI moves with the battle so that you
always have radar support. As the forward edge of battle area (FEBA) moves, GCI
units are repositioned in a leapfrog fashion with other GCI units or with AWACS
support to provide continuous radar coverage. Figure D-1 shows an example of how
a tactical air control system (TACS), one of the many types of GCI, might operate in a
wartime environment.

Text from AAM-4_Ground_Controlled_Intercepts_page_8.jpeg:
GCI operations are the same regardless of whether you are talking to GCI or the
AWACS. They all employ relatively long-range radars to build the “big picture” of
the air-to-air operation. GCI/AWACS is normally the aircrew’s link to the command
authority. Information is passed to and from the command and control authority, and
is used to direct and control aircraft movement depending on the air order of battle.
Since the most effective method of employing fighter aircraft is to optimize the
interface of command and control, our ultimate goal is to make the GCI weapons
director (WD) a “phantom wingman,” as well as a link with the command and control
authority.

In many cases, the WD can sort out friendlies from enemies, has direct contact with
the command authority, and can pass current intelligence and command decisions
rapidly. As you practice intercepts, the WDs are also improving their skills and
training. During mission debriefs it is important that you communicate both problems
and praise in critiquing your intercepts. In this way GCI WDs will get to know when
you are most vulnerable, when you need more information, what type information you
need and what tactics and techniques work best to accomplish the mission.

GCI=s Mission

GCI sites are designed to provide radar surveillance and threat warning over a specific
area. Within this area, GCIs are also tasked to expedite the rendezvous between
fighters and tankers, as well as provide intercept control and monitoring. Stateside,
GCl=s air defense role is to detect and identify aircraft infringing upon U.S. airspace.
This enables the air defense system to intercept and, if required, destroy intruding
aircraft. Overseas GCI roles include assisting in the offensive counter air (OCA)
tasks of sweep and force protection, and in the defensive counter air (DCA) tasks of
force or base protection.

GCI Procedures

AFI 11-214 provides procedures for air-to-air and air-to-surface operations and
training. It is the single source document for all tactical air forces (TAFs) for those
procedures and is supplemented by each command. It also lays out the interface
between the WD and the aircrew. Finally, there is a glossary of terms in the
appendices that are often used in daily contact with GCI. This glossary is extracted
from AFTTP 3-1, Vol 1.

GCI/AWACS Comparison

Manual Radars

There are many types of manual radar systems deployed throughout the world using
hardened sites as well as mobile radars. These radars make up the tactical air control
system (TACS), (see Figure D-1,) which is a mobile command and control system.
TACS, due to its flexibility, permits tailoring to large or small scale operation in
varying warfare intensities and is capable of operating close to the forward edge of the
battle area (FEBA). Presently, most ground components of the TACS use the mobile
TPS 75 planar array radar.

GCI sites may be permanent or mobile depending upon the site’s main mission.
Hardened sites are used for defense of our borders, major commands and anywhere
else that permanence is required. Because of their design, hardened sites are limited
to their location and static area of coverage. The mobile units are positioned as
needed for the battle. The most forward TACS component is the forward air control
post (FACP) which is a mobile unit located about 50 miles from the FEBA. The
command authorities will be in the control and reporting center (CRC), about 200
miles from the FEBA.

Manual sites have a practical range of 240 nm. Since radar is line of sight, the
minimum altitude that targets can be seen is dependent upon the type of intervening
terrain.

Manual radar has a beam width of about 1.5°, and some sites only track in azimuth
and range. Azimuth resolution is 3°, and altitude resolution, if available, could be in
error as much as V2000 feet at 100 nm and V3000 feet at 175 nm. Due to the radar’s
500-foot range resolution, the radar is very good at discriminating two targets within
10 nm of each other, and is usually workable to 1 nm. This radar has a built-in delay
or error, which is the result of the radar antenna’s 6 rpm rotation. Each 360° sweep
takes 10 seconds which produces a 2 to 3 nm lag in the target’s positioning, when
called to the fighter.

The FACP is the last link in the command, control and communication (C’) chain.
However, they do have an extensive UHF/VHF/HF link to the command authority.

Positional Geometry

The three concepts of range, aspect angle and angle off [heading crossing
angle (HCA)] describe one aircraft’s position relative to another

(Figure D-2). The combination of these terms describes which aircraft has
a positional advantage and how much advantage exists.

Range The distance between two aircraft.

Aspect Angle The relative position of the attacker to the target
without regard to the attacker’s heading. Strictly
speaking, aspect angle is measured from the tail of the
target to the position of the attacker. Tail aspect is
zero and head aspect is 180°.

Angle Off (HCA) The angle between the longitudinal axis of the attacker
and the longitudinal axis of the defender. Whenever
the attacker is pointing at the defender, aspect angle
and angle off are the same.

AAM-5 D-4


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_11.jpeg:
Attack Geometry

There are three available attack pursuit courses: lead, lag and pure
(Figure D-3). The attacker’s nose position and lift vector relative to a
target contribute to the pursuit course flown. These geometries are
three-dimensional.

In-plane If the attacker is in the bandit’s plane of motion, the
position of the attacker’s nose determines the pursuit
course. An attacker pointing at the adversary is in pure
pursuit. An attacker pointing behind the bandit is in lag
pursuit. With the nose pointed in front of the bandit, the
attacker is in lead pursuit.

AAM-05-03

Figure D - 3. Pursuit Curves.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_12.jpeg:
Out-of-plane When out of the defender’s plane of motion, the attacker’s
pursuit course is determined by where the present lift
vector will position the nose when reentering the defender’s
turn plane. For example, after gaining sufficient turning
room out of the adversary’s turn plane, the attacker that
pulls far enough in front of the bandit to arrive back
in-plane with the nose in front of the defender is in lead
pursuit. The same holds true for pure or lag pursuit.

Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ)

The primary goal of offensive BFM is to maneuver to a position to kill the
bandit. The area around the adversary from where you can employ
ordnance defines the weapons employment zone (WEZ). The size of the
WEZ depends on the types of ordnance available, airspeed, altitude,
aspect angle, angle off and aircraft turn capability. See AFTTP 3-1 Vol I
for specific weapon employment zones.

Turning Room/Turn Circle

Turning Room

Turning room is the distance between the two aircraft that either aircraft
may use to accelerate and decrease range or to turn and enter the turn
circle. Turning room exists both in and out of the adversary’s plane of
motion.

Turn Circle

The turn circle is a mental projection of the defensive turn over time
(Figure D-4). The size of the turn circle varies with changes in the
adversary’s TAS and G loading. If the attacker’s range to the defender is
greater than the defenders turn diameter, the attacker is outside the
defender’s turn circle. It is important to recognize when you are inside the
defender’s turn circle because when you are there, the bandit cannot turn
hard enough to move you forward of the 3/9 line.

AAM-5 D-6


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_13.jpeg:
Observing and predicting the defender’s turn will create the visual cues
that allow you to recognize when you enter the defender’s turn circle. If
the attacker observes forward line of sight (LOS) movement by the
defender, then the attacker is inside the defender’s turn circle. Another
visual cue is the defender’s aspect angle remains constant or begins to
decrease.

Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_14.jpeg:
Control Zone

The control zone (Figure D-5) is a position along the bandit’s turn circle
from which you can maintain pressure on or “control” the bandit. From
this position, you can rapidly move into a WEZ once you have achieved an
energy advantage or the bandit makes a mistake.

The available weapons envelopes and the defender’s aircraft performance
define the control zone. It is important to recognize weapons envelopes
and develop judgement as to how far away, in terms of time, you are from
the weapons employment zone. The inner limit of the control zone allows
time to react to bandit maneuvers and position for an accurate gun shot,
or maintain minimum weapons range or minimum separation for training
rules. It also allows the attacker to reposition the nose to establish a lead
pursuit curve to enter a WEZ. The closer you get to the inner limit, the
more important it is to have aspect angle, angle off, and closure under
control. At the outer limit of the control zone, you can have more aspect
angle, angle off and closure problems, but you run the risk of taking
pressure off the bandit.

Considering F-15E performance and energy management at medium
altitude, we can establish some generic physical boundaries on the control
zone (Figure D-5).

AAM-5 D-8


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_15.jpeg:
This control zone is valid for F-15E vs F-15E BFM. When encountering a
BFM situation against a dissimilar adversary (F-16, F-18, MiG-29, Su-27,
etc.), understanding the adversaries’ capabilities helps to determine the
control zone.

OFFENSIVE MANEUVERS

These maneuvers allow you to control overtake, get turning room by flying
out of the bandit’s POM and put you in parameters to kill the bandit.
When used correctly, they help you to maintain the advantage and an
acceptable energy level.

Lead Reposition Maneuver

The lead reposition maneuver (Figure D-6) increases closure, decreases
range and/or reduces angle off. To perform this maneuver, increase bank
angle and pull toward the inside of the bandit’s turn circle (Figure D-7).
By over-rotating you gain additional turn rate capability due to increased
radial G. Pull toward the inside of the bandit’s turn circle to establish
lead pursuit. Once in lead, reduce G and accelerate to increase your
energy state, decrease range and increase closure.

<<

Figure D - 6. Lead Reposition.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_16.jpeg:
While holding lead pursuit on the inside of the bandit’s turn, angle off
decreases and fuselages start to align. However, lead pursuit geometry
increases aspect angle as you maneuver across the defender’s turn circle.
This can lead to high closure rates and a possible overshoot. Do not get
too greedy in your bid for lead and bury your nose. Several small lead
repositions are better than one large one. Additionally, one large lead
reposition may telegraph a less than desirable energy state to the bandit.

Lag Reposition Maneuver

The lag reposition maneuver (Figure D-8) primarily controls excess
closure. If the closure or overtake problem is not severe and is caused
solely by an airspeed advantage with fuselages nearly aligned, then
control overtake with a power reduction and/or G onset. If the overtake
problem is more severe, then use out-of-plane maneuvering. Rotate your
lift vector out of the bandit’s plane of motion and pull to out-of-plane lag
pursuit. Be careful not to over-G while rolling as you reposition your lift
vector. Once the closure/aspect problem is under control, reorient your lift
vector and pull back into the bandit’s plane of motion. By doing several
small lag repositions rather than one or two large ones, you can keep
pressure on the bandit with your nose position.

Figure D - 8. Lag Reposition.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_18.jpeg:
The degree of reposition depends on how much closure exists and your
range to the bandit. The earlier you recognize the problem, the less severe
the maneuver needs to be. During the pull out-of-plane, monitor the
bandit’s track along your canopy (Figure D-9). As the bandit’s movement
slows or stops, roll to establish lead pursuit and continue the attack.

You must be very careful when executing lag repositions. If you fly too
high above the bandit, you will exit the control zone. Additionally, if you
do not recognize the bandit’s lift vector on you as you try to go
out-of-plane, you can be forced out of the control zone. The lag maneuver
also tends to reduce aspect angle as you fly toward the bandit’s extended
6 o’clock, but angle off tends to build rapidly. Remember, whenever your
nose is off the bandit, you provide acceleration opportunities to the bandit
and ease the pressure with which you drive the fight.

Quarter Plane

The quarter plane (Figure D-10) is normally thought of as a last ditch
maneuver to preserve nose-tail separation and maintain a position of
offensive advantage. Use this maneuver when faced with a high angle off,
high aspect, high closure and short range situation. It is nothing more
than an extreme lag reposition. To perform the maneuver, roll at least
90° away from the defender’s plane of motion, reduce power (usually to
idle) and pull with high G to control aspect and closure (Figure D-11).

This aggressive out-of-plane maneuver to lag pursuit reduces closure and
aspect, generates turning room, but angle off continues to build. Ifthe
bandit continues to turn, watch for an increasing LOS rate to help
determine when to reorient your lift vector back onto the bandit. When it
looks like you will maintain nose-tail separation (bandit stops moving
back on your canopy), reorient your lift vector and pull toward the control
zone while advancing power back to afterburner. If the bandit attempts to
deny this turning room, reorient your lift vector toward the bandit’s new 6
o'clock and continue to pull. Eventually the bandit will fall off into a
defensive turn or you will enter a scissors. You must continue to monitor
the bandit for a change in the plane of motion or an attempt to separate.

Since the quarter plane is a “last ditch” maneuver to maintain the
offensive, you must be aware of the common errors. Late recognition of
the need for the quarter plane can result in a flight path overshoot and
probable loss of 3/9-line advantage. Recommitting your nose too low may
allow the bandit to force you into a vertical overshoot.

OFFENSIVE BFM

The name of the game offensively is to achieve a position within a
weapons envelope in the quickest possible time and kill the bandit. A
good working knowledge of your available ordnance and their respective
envelopes is mandatory for success in the air-to-air environment.

Objectives

The primary objective of offensive BFM is to kill the bandit. If you cannot
immediately kill the bandit, maneuver to maintain an offensive advantage
through energy and geometry management. Finally, separate prior to
becoming neutral or defensive. Recognize when the fight is becoming
neutral and get out while you are still in control of the situation.

Offensive BFM Setups

Standard setups are fight floor plus 10,000’ AGL, 480 KCAS and line
abreast at fight start range plus 3000’. Ensure you are recording only the
HUD at the ready call. As a technique, do not reject the HUD pitch ladder
or heading scale. Both aircraft strive to be on altitude +500’, at proper
range and at least 400C to call “READY.” When both call “READY,” lead
will check the flight 45° into the defender. The offender performs a hard
turn and works HOTAS to obtain a radar lock. As a technique, after
locking the bandit, use SRM or GUNS to provide easier range assessment
via the ranging reticle. The offender will call “LOCKED, (RANGE)” and
the defender will reverse to a 2-3 G level turn. The defender is responsible
for controlling the angle to achieve a 4 aspect at the “fight’s on” range.

The offender will maintain pure pursuit (waterline on the TD box) and call
(range) every thousand feet. The fight begins at the briefed “fights on”
range. Aircrews should ensure they have the proper setup airspeed (430
KCAS +10) at the “fights on.” Terminate if the setup parameters are not
precisely achieved.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_22.jpeg:
After a fight terminates, deconflict flight paths, establish a 350 KCAS mil
power climb and strive for a line abreast formation at the proper spacing
for the next setup. Climb to altitude and accelerate to the starting
airspeed. Do not call ready with less than 400 KCAS.

Offensive BFM can be divided into two areas: long range BFM and short
range BFM. Remember that you are not required to do any of these
maneuvers if they are not necessary. However, if the bandit is
uncooperative or you make a mistake, you must maneuver to maintain the
advantage and achieve the desired weapons parameters.

Long Range BFM

Long range offensive BFM begins with a 3/9 advantage at a range outside
of the defender’s projected turn circle (Figure D-12). The initial problem is
one of range. To employ BFM, you must enter the bandit’s turn circle.
Note that the defender has time to generate aspect angle and angle off
problems while the attacker is accelerating toward the turn circle.

The attacker’s goal is to fly to an offset point on the defender’s turn circle,
make a max performance turn (offensive break turn) to a slight flight path
overshoot about one turn radius behind the bandit. Three basic options of
lead, pure and lag pursuit now become players for entry into the bandit’s
turn circle.

AAM-5 D-16


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_23.jpeg:
Lead Pursuit Entry

While outside the turn circle, you can pull all the lead you want. This
entry results in increased aspect, large HCAs, high closure and an
excessive flight path overshoot. You may want to use this when trying for
an AIM-9M followed by a high angle gun shot and a separation (i.e., near
JOKER/BINGO fuel, minimum ordnance and/or fighting a superior
bandit).

, AAM-05-12

Figure D - 12. Lead Entry.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_24.jpeg:
Pure Pursuit Entry

The next option is pure pursuit. When you choose pure pursuit, drive
right at the bandit in the HUD. This forces the defender to turn to honor
your nose, but also lets the bandit build excessive angle problems for you
to solve (Figure D-13). This entry may work well against an inferior
turning bandit, but against a similar turning bandit, it creates similar
problems as the lead pursuit entry.

AAM-5 D-18


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_25.jpeg:
Lag Pursuit Entry

A lag entry to the circle means pointing your nose to a place behind the
bandit and flying to the bandit’s turn circle (Figure D-14). The object is to
get there with as much turning room as you can get without going out the
backside of the turn circle. However, you cannot threaten the bandit with
your nose in lag for long periods of time. This takes pressure off, allows
the bandit to accelerate and could extend the time required for the kill.

Figure D - 14. Lag Entry.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_26.jpeg:
Knowing when you enter the bandit’s turn circle requires constant
assessment of your position relative to the bandit’s. As you enter the turn
circle, the bandit’s aspect angle begins to decrease or stabilize. Following
this, the bandit’s line of sight (LOS) rate across the canopy will increase.
This increase in LOS is the biggest clue that you are entering the bandit’s
turn circle.

You may also need vertical turning room, but use caution getting it. The
bandit may deny turning room below the original plane of motion with a
slightly nose low defensive turn. Going for excessive turning room above
the bandit may allow the bandit to use it against you, energy state
permitting. Since the bandit will most likely not go up, to avoid an
airspeed loss, you can usually go for a slight amount of uphill vertical
turning room as you enter the turn circle.

Displace your pursuit course from the center of the bandit’s turn circle
opposite the direction of the defensive turn. One way to do this is to drive
to where the bandit was when the defensive turn began. Continuously
analyze the bandit’s defensive turn, realizing that, as the radius becomes
smaller, the closer to the center of the circle you will have to set your
initial turn. During this initial move, accelerate to slightly above your
corner velocity, or about 450 knots maximum. On longer range setups, a
slight power reduction may be required to remain below 450 knots.

Approaching the turn circle, the bandit should drift about 30-40° and
approach the canopy bow. Entering the turn circle, begin a max rate turn
to hold the bandit no higher than just below the canopy bow. Smoothly
pull to between the single and double rate beeper to get to the max G
allowable. As a technique, if you are below 450 KCAS, pull the stick about
34 the way back to the seat pan until the aircraft digs in and you feel a

6-7 G onset, and then smoothly pull the stick all the way back to the seat
pan. You should be able to achieve greater than 7.5 Gs with this
technique. However, be very aware of your airspeed and altitude, as this
technique is only valid for airspeeds below 450 KCAS and less than

18,000 ft MSL. Remember that above corner velocity, the beeper precedes
any buffet. As airspeed decreases toward corner, anticipate the need to
blend in full AB to sustain a max rate turn. You may have to modulate
power to get through corner velocity quickly. This max rate turn normally
results in a turn radius as good as or better than the defender’s. Also, the
energy advantage obtained before the attacker’s break turn often results
in a slight flight path overshoot. This slight overshoot should occur no
closer than one turn radius behind the defender. Bring the nose back
inside the turn circle for a second offensive BFM move. This should put
you closer, slower and with fewer angles in relation to the bandit. For

example if you started at 9000 feet, you should now be around 6000 feet.
During the pull back inside, the geometry may allow a low aspect missile
shot against an inferior turning adversary.

Once established on or inside the bandit’s turn circle, use short range
BFM to fly to the control zone. From the control zone you can continue to
pressure the bandit while maintaining or regaining energy and eventually
employ weapons.

Short Range BFM

Short range offensive BFM begins at, or slightly inside, the turn circle and
behind the bandit’s 3/9 line. Once inside the turn circle, the objective is to
control aspect, angle-off and range while maneuvering toward a position
to employ ordnance.

At the start of a short-range BFM engagement, entry into the bandit’s
turn circle is much like the long range BFM problem. Drive to where the
bandit’s break turn started and evaluate the bandit’s break turn. There
are excellent cockpit references for positioning the bandit while continuing
to threaten with your nose (Figures D-15 and D-16). In your lag
maneuver, position the bandit about 20-30° toward the inside of the turn.
This should be near the center of the inside canopy mirror. When the
bandit’s LOS rate accelerates outside of the mirror, roll back in plane or to
lead and pull the bandit to the top of the canopy bow or top of the HUD.
Continue your pull if within weapons engagement zone range limits and
shoot. If unable to pull the bandit to the HUD, perform another lag
maneuver and accelerate. Repeat these maneuvers until you have
achieved a performance advantage, then pull the bandit to the HUD and
kill him. Remember that multiple small maneuvers are more energy
conserving than one large one, so be patient.

After obtaining a tally, the bandit’s reaction will most likely be an
immediate max performance break turn. The quickest shot opportunity
will occur against a poorer turning aircraft. If your max performance turn
keeps your nose in pure or lead pursuit and inside the defender’s turn
circle, go for a gunshot. Be aware that this method requires that you solve
your BFM and gun sight conditions in minimum time.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_28.jpeg:
If you cannot generate a higher rate turn than the adversary, you will not
be able to go pure pursuit in-plane to shoot and you will remain in a lag
position. The result is most likely a slight flight path overshoot, though it
will be a smaller overshoot than the long range BFM setup. As the
bandit’s LOS rate permits, pull into lead pursuit and setup for the
gunshot.

As you close on the bandit for the gunshot, overtake control is critical in
preventing a gross overshoot. Use out-of-plane maneuvering to control
excess closure against a slow defender. However, if inside the turn circle,
power modulation may be all that is required to match the bandit’s LOS
rate and obtain a gunshot. Put your pipper on the bandit and force a jink
out of plane, reducing angles and Ve.

It is normally necessary to modulate power against a performance-limited
bandit. The intent is to stay at a higher energy state which, assuming the
altitudes are close, implies more calibrated knots.

Offensive BFM Errors

In offensive BFM, the most common mistakes have to do with fight
analysis. In analyzing the fight, the first thing to realize is the bandit’s
initial move can determine the type fight it is going to be. If the bandit’s
turn does not bring you through the 3/9 line, you should be able to remain
offensive, and classic offensive BFM applies. However, if the bandit can
get you ahead of the 3/9 line on the initial move, and you make no attempt
to control aspect, you will most likely overshoot and become defensive. In
this situation, many attackers start a quarter plane and zoom, trying to
save a flight path overshoot (thinking offensively), only to have the bandit
pull right to the attacker’s six. Although this maneuver may be successful
against a thrust-limited aircraft, when you try this against an aircraft
with similar capabilities, you will be surprised in a bad way. When you
attack a highly maneuverable aircraft that gets you ahead of the 3/9 line
on the initial move, do not give up all your energy and try to save a flight
path overshoot. Instead, initially fight a neutral fight and use your
energy advantage to regain the offensive.

Another common offensive mistake is power and airspeed control. Again,
the defender drives the fight. The bandits turn rate and radius determine
where you have to be if you want to kill. If you are turning to attack the
bandit from behind the 3/9 line, and the bandit is moving away from your
HUD, you are probably going too fast or not applying enough G. Pull the
throttles or stick back to stop the LOS movement on the canopy and
continue to readjust power and G to maintain the turn performance you
want.

Fight control, or lack of it, is also a common offensive BFM mistake.

Many times bandits who are out of airspeed and ideas are given a “new
lease on life” when the attacker performs a reposition maneuver that is
not necessary or too large. When you pull your nose off the bandit, you
are relaxing pressure and giving the bandit options. As a rule of thumb, if
you can keep the bandit within your canopy bow, the bandit will definitely
feel pressure and should remain predictable. Use pure pursuit only when
ready to employ ordnance, otherwise use lead and lag pursuit maneuvers
to control aspect, angle off and closure problems. These maneuvers should
be as small as possible to keep your nose on and pressuring, while
minimizing the bandit’s options. Using the same size reposition at

6000 feet when you are at 3000 feet will cause excessive angle off and ease
pressure on the bandit. As stated earlier, patience is important. Two
small repositions are better than one large one.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_31.jpeg:
Finally, once you are in the control position, seek to employ ordnance.
Remember the reason you do offensive BFM is to achieve a quick kill. In
the Strike Eagle, prolonged maneuvering in the BFM arena may lead to a
neutral or defensive situation or a one versus many engagement.

Scissors

A scissors is a series of rolls and reversals, caused by the bandit
attempting to reverse and force a slow speed fight. This will happen if you
are late to recognize a range or closure problem. The bandit will attempt
to accentuate the upcoming overshoot by pulling for your 6 o’clock. As you
react with your own roll and pull, a scissors develops (Figure D-17).

AAM-05-17

Figure D - 16. Scissors.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_32.jpeg:
Flat Scissors

A flat scissors is the result of an in-plane overshoot. The first priority is to
stop your forward velocity relative to the bandit. To do so, set the wings
relative to the horizon and pull up. Use idle power to slow forward
velocity initially, followed by max AB to maintain pitch attitude. When
the bandit starts to move forward on the canopy, pull to the bandit's high
6 o’clock to establish a 3/9 line advantage.

Lift vector control in the flat scissors is paramount. Overbanking causes a
loss of lift, which will cause your nose to drop, your ground velocity to
increase, and you will probably give up 3/9 advantage. Maintain a higher
relative nose position and the minimum lateral spacing to keep the bandit
out in front.

Once you have a 3/9-line advantage, use an early reversal (lead turn) at
the next pass to start reducing angle-off and slow the LOS. This in turn
will allow you a higher Pk gun opportunity. It is possible the bandit will
not allow you to slow the LOS sufficiently and force a low LOS snapshot.
You can attempt additional snapshots as long as the bandit decides to stay
in the fight. If the bandit attempts to leave, the bandit’s wings will
telegraph the maneuver. Seeing this, do your best lead turn in-plane and
predict the bandit’s flight path. Remember that a flat scissors is a slow
speed flying contest won by the aircraft more maneuverable at slow speed
and high AOA. If the outcome is in doubt, look for an opportunity to
separate before losing 3/9 advantage.

Major errors in a flat scissors are:

e Not pulling parallel to the horizon and thus increasing horizontal
travel.

e Not pulling toward the bandit’s six allowing too much lateral
separation to develop.

e Not controlling bank angle at slow speed and losing nose position.

e Not taking advantage of early reversal after gaining 3/9 advantage.

AAM-5 D - 26


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_33.jpeg:
Rolling Scissors

A rolling scissors (Figure D-18) generally occurs when the overshoot is in
the vertical (out-of-plane) or an altitude differential exists at the initiation
of a flat scissors. A lower wing-loaded adversary may also force you into a
rolling scissors as a defense.

In a rolling scissors, as your lift vector drops, your forward velocity vector
increases forcing you forward. The fighter on the bottom can accentuate
the forward “flush” by pulling the aircraft into the vertical and now the
roles are reversed. If neither of you transition to a flat scissors when on
top, these role reversals continue until one fighter out flies the other and
gains a sufficient energy advantage to roll toward the other fighter’s six.
In general, a rolling scissors will become a nose low spiral to the floor if
continued. In a continuous rolling scissors, the fighter with the better
maneuverability and ability to point the nose will win. Separating from a
rolling scissors is generally easier than from a flat scissors if done early
and properly. The best time to initiate the separation is during the roll
down while the bandit is pulling up. Errors in rolling scissors are the
same as a flat scissors except the aircraft must be overbanked to achieve
the roll.

Separations

The primary goal of offensive BFM is to maneuver into weapons
parameters. Once you recognize you no longer have the potential to
achieve shot parameters, it is foolish to continue maneuvering against an
adversary. Your goal now is to attempt to separate prior to losing your
offensive position (Figure D-19). Do not wait until a defensive situation
develops before attempting a separation.

Figure D - 18. Separation.

Once you have made the decision to separate, stop turning with the
bandit. Employ ordnance against the bandit to force a reaction while you
turn for separation. If you are unable to employ ordnance, do not close in
an obvious nonlethal position as this wastes energy that could be better
used for the subsequent separation. Once you recognize that you will not
have another shot opportunity, initiate your separation. Unload to
accelerate, but keep the aircraft banked to give the impression that you
are just sliding into deep lag. When at deep six and hopefully out of view,
roll and pull to establish max HCA (150-180°). Once there, unload again
and roll to reacquire the bandit. Be aware of the aircraft’s attitude and
altitude to avoid getting too nose low to avoid a floor kill. It is imperative
that you reacquire the bandit to assess your next move. With the tally,
continue small check turns to continue to increase HCA, being careful not
to over-g. As your speed increases, continue to maintain 8-10 units AOA.

AAM-5 D - 28


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_35.jpeg:
If the bandit reverses, you need to either break into the bandit or continue
to separate out of range, based on your assessment of the WEZ. Both
options necessitate chaff and flares.

Errors in separations include:

e Rolling and pulling too early thus telegraphing your intentions.

e Not pulling hard enough or long enough to establish maximum HCA.
e Not reacquiring the bandit.

e Not maintaining the unload.

e Hitting the ground.

e Breaking into the bandit after achieving a valid separation.

Short Range Radar Employment

Flying good BFM will put you into a WEZ. The AIM-120, AIM-9M and
the gun can all be launched without a radar lock. Fly BFM first and do
HOTAS second. However, for optimum weapons employment, you should
have a radar lock. Inability to achieve a lock on and employ weapons will
extend your BFM engagement, and will increase your vulnerability to
attack from an undetected bandit. The radar auto acquisition modes are
for short range, visual acquisition and lock on. For a complete discussion
of auto acquisition modes, refer to your Dash-34 and the RDR-3 workbook.
It is essential that you know the acquisition limits of each mode so that
you can rapidly determine which mode to select and achieve the lock.

Auto guns mode is a space-stabilized search, meaning that the radar
continues to search the selected volume of airspace as you maneuver. Due
to space stabilization, auto guns is frequently considered a nonvisual
acquisition mode. The advantages of auto guns are large search volume,
slewable search and ability to use the radar for clearing beyond the
immediate fight. It is important to be very precise when slewing your
coverage, especially in altitude. The disadvantages are that the MPRF
wave form used for auto guns does not allow a lock on inside of 3000 feet
and you must reference the radar scope to determine actual altitude
coverage.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_36.jpeg:
Long range boresight, boresight, super search and vertical scan modes are
all heading stabilized, meaning that the airspace searched moves as you
maneuver your aircraft. Each of the modes take priority over auto guns
search. The radar uses a short pulse MPRF waveform to lock on at ranges
as close as 500 feet. Long range boresight is not usually used in the visual
merge arena.

Boresight mode is the most discriminating of the auto acquisition modes
because of the small amount of airspace searched (4° around radar
boreline). Radar discrimination is a big advantage in a multi-aircraft
fight but the disadvantage is that the volume of airspace searched is
small. Because the radar searches around the radar boreline, using this
technique requires pure pursuit geometry until the radar locks on.
Boresight is the most reliable and rapid acquisition mode.

Vertical scan acquisition mode uses a very narrow azimuth search from
+5° to +55° in elevation. The advantage of vertical scan is the search
volume is along the lift vector. The disadvantage is that your lift vector
must be on the bandit during maneuvers and at times this is not
appropriate. The primary problem with using this mode comes from not
recognizing the difference between plane of motion and plane of
symmetry. The planes are aligned only when bank angle is zero, or in
pure vertical maneuvering. Lock on problems occur when the pilot
positions the lift vector on the target (aligns planes of motion) and the
vertical scan search volume (along plane of symmetry) misses the bandit.
An additional BFM error often occurs as the pilot spends too much time
near the bandit’s plane of motion while attempting the lock on, thus
denying or losing turning room. A second positioning error concerns
pulling the bandit through the HUD and below the +5° coverage of
vertical scan. Remember, once the target is at or below the waterline, it is
below vertical scan coverage.

AAM-5 D - 30


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_37.jpeg:
The supersearch acquisition mode offers the advantages of a heading
stabilized search with a relatively large search volume (slewable
supersearch). The disadvantages of supersearch are that the target must
remain relatively stable in the search volume for lock on to occur and that
there is a blind zone from +6° to +18°. The canopy reference is from near
the top of the HUD to just below the canopy bow. The supersearch up
HUD display is somewhat misleading because it depicts coverage where
no coverage exists.

Generally, the pilot will select auto guns before attempting another auto
acquisition mode. This allows the radar to search beyond the immediate
fight while you maneuver and take command of the radar, enabling the
other auto acquisition modes. Selection of auto guns also prevents entry
to TWS modes if a lock on is undetected and the auto acquisition switch is
moved forward or aft. After lock on, selection of MRM from SRM or guns
forces the radar to attempt immediate HPRF upgrade, possibly saving a
minimum range AIM-7 shot opportunity.

INTRODUCTION

In every conflict since WWI, aircraft have been used to destroy other
aircraft. Although aircraft, weapons and arenas have changed, basic
concepts and basic maneuvering have remained the same. With this in
mind, this workbook covers those basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) that
currently apply to the F-15E and the threats we face.

The purpose of air-to-air combat is to destroy the enemy and survive. To
accomplish this task, you may be required to employ BFM. Basic fighter
maneuvers are not exact maneuvers flown to a specific conclusion, but
combinations of maneuvers blended together. How you combine these
maneuvers depends on your continual assessment of the situation. First,
force a reaction from the bandit, predict where the bandit is going and
then maneuver to achieve weapons parameters. You must constantly
reassess the effectiveness of your maneuvers and the reactions of the
bandit. By maintaining a continual process of force, predict and
maneuver, you will achieve the kill or a tactical separation.

Basic fighter maneuvers are a blend of rolls, turns and accelerations to
gain an energy or a positional advantage, or both, over an airborne
adversary. You should remember that the primary purpose of these
maneuvers is to place your aircraft within weapons parameters (offensive)
to kill the bandit or to deny an adversary entry into weapons parameters
(defensive) to survive.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_8.jpeg:
BFM MECHANICS AND DEFINITIONS

BFM is the application of aircraft handling skills to solve the problems of

range, closure,

aspect and angle off in relation to another aircraft. The

three BFM tools are roll, turn and acceleration.

Roll

Turn

Acceleration

AAM-5

Roll allows you to position your lift vector and determine
the plane of motion (POM) in which you turn. Roll also
aids you in keeping sight of the bandit.

A turn allows you to attain weapons employment zones or
defeat your bandit’s attack/weapons. As your instructor
will show you, optimum or max turns can be defined by
aircraft angle of attack.

Energy is an important commodity during air-to-air
maneuvering. Your aircraft will not always do everything
you want it to and maintain a high-energy state. Thus,
you will often need to regain energy. The quickest way to
do this is through a well-executed acceleration. The F-15E
generally does its best acceleration at 8-10 units AOA.

Although getting energy back is your main goal, keep these
in mind:

e Be cognizant of your attitude (do not try to
accelerate going up), altitude (if you hit the ground
you have finished the enemy's job) and airspeed (do
not spend valuable time out of the fight accelerating
if you do not really need the extra airspeed). During
BF, there is a constant trade off between energy
and nose position.

e Be aware of your nose position. Acceleration
maneuvers often result in a nose low attitude.
Allowing your nose to get buried forces you to give
up your newly gained energy to get back in the fight.


Text from AAM-5_OBFM_page_9.jpeg:
BFM and Aircraft Feel

Successful energy management is often the key element in determining
the outcome of a maneuvering fight. The challenge of energy
management is knowing your aircraft’s envelope and developing a
“heads-up” feel for aircraft performance and energy state. AOA control is
essential in performing each of the basic maneuvers. Figure D-1
illustrates some key numbers that provide a reference for “max
performing” the Strike Eagle.

Geometry

In order to execute successful BFM, a pilot must understand the geometric
relationship to the target and how it affects weapon employment
capability. The spatial relationship of two aircraft can be analyzed from
three perspectives: positional geometry, attack geometry and the weapons
envelope.

Positional Geometry

Range, aspect angle and angle-off (heading crossing angle (HCA)) describe
the positional relationship between two aircraft (Figure D-2). These three
factors dictate which aircraft enjoys a positional advantage, and how
much of an advantage it is.

Range - the distance between two aircraft.
Aspect Angle - the relative position of the attacker to the target without
regard to the attacker's heading. Strictly speaking, aspect angle is
measured from the tail of the target to the position of the attacker.
Angle Off - (Heading Crossing Angle or HCA) the angle between the

longitudinal axis of the attacker and the longitudinal axis of the defender,
or simply the difference in their headings.

AAM-6 D-4


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_11.jpeg:
Attack Geometry

There are three available attack pursuit courses: lead, lag and pure
(Figure D-3). Both nose position and lift vector relative to a defender
contribute to the pursuit course that the bandit may fly. These

geometries are 3-dimensional.

In-plane - If the bandit is in the defender’s plane of motion, the position of
the bandit’s nose determines the pursuit course. If the bandit points at
the defender, the bandit is in pure pursuit. If the bandit points behind the
defender, the bandit is in lag pursuit. With the nose pointed in front of
the defender (such as the case in a gunshot), the bandit is in lead pursuit.

AAM-6


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_12.jpeg:
Out-of-plane (vertical) - When the attacker is out of the defender’s plane of
motion (POM), the attacker’s pursuit course is determined by where the
present lift vector will position the nose when the attacker reenters the
defender’s turn plane. For example, if forced out-of-plane by a defender’s
turn, an attacker may have the nose pointed behind the defender during
the reposition. After gaining sufficient turning room, if the attacker pulls
far enough in front of the defender to arrive back in-plane with the nose in
front, then the attacker is in lead pursuit. The same holds true for pure or
lag pursuit.

Weapon Employment Zone (WEZ)

The WEZ is an area in front of the attacker, bounded by his weapons min
and max ranges, where he may successfully employ weapons. It is
determined by the attacker’s ordnance capabilities and is affected by
airspeed, altitude, and aircraft turn capability. The defender can, to a
degree, control aspect, angle-off and range which further affects the
attacker’s weapons capabilities. See AFTTP 3-1 Vol I for specific weapon
employment zones.

Turning Room/Turn Circle

Turning Room

Turning room is the separation between two aircraft that can be used to
accelerate and decrease range, or to turn and enter the turn circle thus
decreasing aspect and angle-off. Turning room can exist in either the
lateral or vertical plane.

Turn Circle

The turn circle is a mental projection of the defensive turn over time.
Obviously, if the defender changes G or airspeed, this imaginary circle’s
radius changes accordingly. It is important to recognize when the attacker
enters the defender’s turn circle. Once the attacker has entered the
defender’s turn circle, the defender can no longer turn hard enough to
move the attacker forward of the 3/9 line. Prior to the attacker entering
the turn circle, the defender can generate angles at will.

There are visual cues that allow the defender to recognize when the
attacker has entered the turn circle. When the attacker stops moving
forward on the canopy during a defensive break turn and begins to move
aft, the attacker has entered the turn circle. In other words, the aspect
angle remains constant or begins to decrease.

AAM-6 D-6


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_13.jpeg:
Vertical Turning

Turn rate and radius are affected by the earth’s gravity. Any time the
aircraft’s lift vector is above the horizon, turn rate is decreased and turn
radius is increased. If a loop were performed at a constant (cockpit) G, the
flight path would scribe an “egg” shape in the sky (Figure D-4). A 4 G loop
would result in effective radial G (Gr) loadings as indicated in the figure.
From the cockpit perspective, a 4 G turn at the top of a loop “turns like” a
5 G horizontal turn.

Figure D - 4. Vertical Turning.


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_14.jpeg:
If an aircraft is able to turn with the lift vector below the horizon, turn
rate increases and radius decreases (assuming constant airspeed and
cockpit G). The converse is true during turns with lift vector above the
horizon (see Figure D-5). From a vertical (directly above) perspective, the
downhill turning aircraft turns inside the aircraft turning uphill. A
downhill turn at key points in a BFM engagement may improve relative
turning performance compared to the adversary.

Turns performed in the “pure” vertical (i.e., no lateral or horizontal
component) deny a trailing (similar) aircraft, at a lower energy state, the
capability to counter the result of the energy differential by performing an
oblique or horizontal turn (Figure D-6).

Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_16.jpeg:
Control Zone

The control zone (Figure D-7) is a position along the defender’s turn circle
from which an attacker can maintain pressure on or “control” the
defender. From the control zone, the attacker can move into a weapons
employment zone once achieving an energy advantage or the defender
makes a mistake.

The dimensions of the control zone are defined in general terms by the
adversary’s weapons and the defender’s aircraft performance. It is
important to recognize weapons envelopes and develop judgement on how
far away, in terms of time, an attacker is from the weapons employment
zone. The inner limit of the control zone will allow time for an attacker to
react to defensive maneuvers, position for an accurate gun shot and allow
minimum weapons range or training rule minimum separation. It also
allows the attacker to reposition the nose to establish a lead pursuit curve
to enter a WEZ. The closer an attacker gets to the inner limit, the more
important it is to have aspect angle, angle off and closure under control as
a high energy defender can develop high LOS rates at close range. At the
outer limit of the control zone, an attacker can still apply pressure without
giving the defender opportunities for regaining energy or changing the
fight. Since the outer limit depends on the defender’s turn circle, it is
important to maintain your energy and G-capability.

Considering F-15E performance and energy management at medium
altitude we can establish some generic physical boundaries on the control
zone (Figure D-7).

Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_17.jpeg:
This control zone is valid for F-15E vs F-15E BFM. When encountering a
BFM situation against a different adversary (F-16, F-18, MiG-29, Su-27,
etc.) understanding the adversary’s capabilities will help you determine
your own control zone.

DEFENSIVE BFM

The objective in defensive BFM is to survive the attack. You must deny or
defeat the attacker’s weapons opportunities and then generate range,
closure, aspect or angle off problems. The first step is to defeat any
weapons in the air and then deny the attacker entry into a weapons
employment zone. To do this you must be knowledgeable of the attacker’s
aircraft and weapon systems capabilities. The most fundamental concern
is to maintain the tally on the attacker. You cannot successfully analyze
and assess the potential of a bandit you do not see. Energy management
is crucial during DBFM. If a bandit has similar capabilities, you must fly
more efficiently and/or exploit any BFM mistakes to defeat that bandit.

Given the time to evaluate all the factors (range, overtake, pilot skill,
aircraft type, etc.) of an attack, the pilot can devise a defensive plan
custom-made for the particular situation. Unfortunately, pilots do not do
their best creative thinking in a high-G turn while looking over their
shoulder at someone trying to kill them. What is needed then is a simple
strategy that is easily remembered and executed. Even though it may not
be the best scheme for every situation, it should guarantee survival by
denying the attacker valid shot parameters. The idea is to force a reaction
by the bandit and not allow the positional advantage for the bandit to
continue.

The defensive strategies described in this section assume a worst case
situation of the bandit at your 5 to 7 o’clock position, with overtake, and a
tally. Obviously, if you know that any of these conditions do not exist,
then you can modify the plan based on the additional information you
have. However, if you are not certain, then it is in your best interest to
assume the worst case and defend accordingly. The elements of these
defensive countermoves will be analyzed with respect to the range and
nose position of the attacker.

Initial Moves

The defender’s initial maneuver generally determines the outcome of the
engagement. You must react quickly and decisively.


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_18.jpeg:
When the bandit is at long range with low closure, an extension may be
appropriate to deny any weapons envelopes. The danger in this option is
that accurate determination of range may be difficult, particularly when
the attacking aircraft is small. If you incorrectly analyze range and/or
closure then the attacker may already be in weapons parameters. As this
is not the desired outcome, we will consider another option.

If the bandit is visually acquired at a range of 2 nm or greater, you can
turn to merge high aspect or possibly engage offensively. With sufficient
energy, you can counter any split-plane maneuvering by pulling into the
bandit’s plane of motion.

If you first detect the bandit inside of 2 nm, your first priority is to deny or
defeat all weapons employment opportunities. Your best opportunity for
survival is to defeat weapons while they are still on the rail. To deny
weapons employment you must rapidly increase aspect and angle off while
decreasing range. Perform an unloaded roll to rapidly bring your lift
vector on or slightly below the bandit and then initiate a turn based on the
bandit’s range, aspect, ordnance and overtake. The closer the bandit is to
weapons parameters, the harder your turn must be. Allow your airspeed
to bleed toward corner velocity during the first part of the turn. Gs during
the first part of the turn are based on the attacker’s range, but in almost
all cases you should achieve at least 6 Gs in the initial turn.

The closer the attacker is to a weapons employment zone, the harder your
turn must be (up to maximum allowable G). You must generate a high
turn rate to rotate your vulnerable cone and a small turn circle to deny
the attacker an early entry for BFM. If your initial airspeed is well above
your sustained corner, you must reduce power (and possibly extend the
speedbrake) while setting your lift vector and pulling to the bandit. As
you approach corner velocity, retract the speedbrake and increase power
up to maximum AB to sustain your turn. If the OWS beeper is on and you
do not feel slight buffet, you are too fast. If you feel moderate buffet with
no OWS beeper, you are too slow. In either case, select the appropriate
power setting and orient your lift vector for maximum performance turns.
As you initiate your turn, employ chaff and/or flares.

During the turn, it is imperative that you monitor the bandit’s position.
The purpose of the turn is to generate aspect and/or closure problems for
the attacker. If this is occurring, the attacker will move forward from the
5 or 7 o'clock position toward your nose. If the attacker is not moving
forward, you must turn harder by slowing toward corner velocity and
increasing G.

Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_19.jpeg:
A hard turn against an in-plane bandit will generate an overshoot if the
bandit does nothing to acquire additional turning room (i.e., perform
BFM). How much of an overshoot depends on the initial aspect, angle-off,
closure, range and the amount of turn generated by the defending fighter.
The more you can increase any of the above factors, the greater the
overshoot will be (Figure D-8). It is to your advantage to generate a large
angle-off problem for the attacker as early as possible. If in doubt, use a
break turn versus a hard turn.

Visual References for Defensive BFM

The weapons employment zone you are concerned with in training is
defined by range, aspect and nose position. Developing a feel for range
comes with experience and should be practiced on all weapon system
checks. Some rules of thumb for the F-15E are: anti-collision beacons
visible at 2500-3000 feet, square intakes discernable at 3000-3500 feet
and external tanks at about 6000 feet.

Pursuit geometry is determined by attacker’s nose position. If an attacker
is in lead pursuit, the attacker’s nose is pointing in front of your aircraft
and you see the bottom of the attacker’s aircraft. When in lag pursuit, the
nose is pointing behind you and you see the top of the aircraft. Depending
on environmental considerations, aspect and pursuit geometry may be
difficult to determine. Aircraft structures such as external tanks or
missiles (lead) and canopy, speed brake or top of engine bays (lag) provide
valuable visual cues. A pure pursuit bandit is nose on and typically closer
than estimated.

You can determine the aspect angle problem you are creating for the
attacker and the attacker’s position relative to the control zone by
reference to your aircraft structure (Figures D-9 and D-10). A nose-on
bandit inside of 9000 feet and aft of your wing tip is approaching a WEZ.
When you are looking over your aileron at the attacker, the attacker is in
the control zone (about 30° aspect angle), assuming appropriate ranges.
Your goal, defensively, is to keep the bandit forward of the wing tip (out of
the control zone) unless that bandit has a lot of heading crossing angle.

Additional references must be used to determine the bandit’s aspect

because you are rarely straight and level while performing BFM. The top
of the vertical tails also equates to approximately 30° aspect.

Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_23.jpeg:
Analyzing the Fight

You can control an engagement in which you are defensive. By making an
appropriate initial move, you can defeat the first attack and force the
bandit to maneuver. An aware bandit will make some BFM maneuver to
help solve the problems you generated in your initial move. The quicker
you can generate BFM problems, the more aggressive and energy
depleting the bandit’s subsequent BFM will be. By driving the fight you
can more accurately predict the bandit’s follow-on maneuvers and assess
the bandit’s potential while preparing for your next maneuver.

First, determine the effectiveness of your initial turn. You should observe
the bandit moving forward from the 5 or 7 o'clock position. If the bandit is
not moving forward you must increase your turn rate (use more G and/or
get closer to corner velocity) to increase aspect and angle off. Now watch
the bandit’s nose position to predict intentions. If the bandit is
established in lead or pure pursuit, continue your turn and expect a high
aspect pass. If the bandit is in plane, prepare for the front quarter gun
attack. Approaching maximum gun range, jink and then look for the
opportunity to separate.

If you see an out of plane maneuver, the bandit is looking to build turning
room for a subsequent attack. A good reference for building out of plane
turning room is that the bandit starts moving toward the side of the
canopy. Your options now are based on your own energy state. If you are
still at relatively high energy, unload and roll to reorient your lift vector
on the bandit, then turn to increase aspect and angle off. If your energy
state is low and the bandit is not threatening, perform an opt turn, or
extend to regain energy. Be careful not to convey your intentions by
rolling wings level. Maintaining the bank does not hurt your acceleration.
It also helps you maintain the tally. Reduce your nose low attitude at the
completion of the maneuver. Do not lose sight! Roll the aircraft or use
quick check turns to keep the bandit in sight.


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_24.jpeg:
During the extension, you must continue to monitor the bandit’s actions.
As you extend away, or when the bandit solves the BFM problem, expect
the bandit to bring the nose in-plane again. Assess range and closure, and
if threatened, turn hard into the bandit. Timing is critical here. If you
allow the bandit into your vulnerable cone inside any weapons ranges, you
may die. Be cognizant of the airspeed you gained during the extension,
and avoid a high-speed, high G, low rate turn. If you see that the bandit
is out of weapons parameters due to range or lack of overtake, your best
move is to continue your separation. Remember that these initial
defensive reactions are designed to help you survive the first moments of
the attack when you acquire the bandit and know little more than the
bandit’s range and nose position. As you learn more about adversary
potential and capability, alter your defense accordingly. Attempt to have
the bandit react to you by being aggressive.

The initial move should force the bandit to overshoot. If the bandit has
good turn performance the overshoot will occur with low angle off. If the
bandit’s turn performance is poor, the angle off will be fairly high. You
now predict any capabilities and intentions based on angle off and aspect.
Against a superior turning bandit, you must continue the hard turn and
wait for a mistake or for a depletion of energy.

If the bandit has its nose in lead but is at low aspect with little or no
apparent closure then the bandit is using positional geometry for closure
and probably arcing for a gunshot. Typically, an arcing bandit will be
nose low in lead and below the horizon. Since the bandit is not
threatening, an extension maneuver may be appropriate depending on
your energy state and the bandit’s weapon load and range, or simply
rotate your lift vector slightly above the bandit while continuing the turn.
This will generate turning room that the low energy, nose low bandit
cannot use but that you can. When sufficient turning room is available
(about 4000 feet), reorient your lift vector to high six and pull to a
separation. Be cautious not to over-rotate and pull back in to a high angle
gunshot. You must pull to a point above the bandit’s aircraft.

If the bandit has fairly high energy, as evidenced by good nose rate and
decreasing angle off from low aspect, you must continue the same
maneuvers as the initial move. Be alert for canopy motion to stop and
then start moving backwards as you turn. The bandit is probably
accelerating in lag (you see the top of the aircraft) or maneuvering for a
lag reposition. You must keep the bandit in sight and prepare for any turn
back to pure pursuit. The key here is to make your hard turn at the same
time or before the bandit. Do not let a bandit reduce angle off while at low
aspect or you will die.

AAM-6 D-18


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_25.jpeg:
Prior to discussing bandits at 9000 feet, 6000 feet and 3000 feet, there are
some general comments that cover all three.

The most common BFM error is losing sight of the bandit. This is often
due to poor lookout technique and bad seat position. Simply attempting to
look straight out the top of the canopy without shifting your body is
uncomfortable, if not impossible, under high G. Try to sit as far back in
the seat as possible and then lean forward and away from the turn. In
this manner you can put your shoulder in the back of the seat for support
and easily see out the top of the canopy or over the top of the seat. This
also allows you to use the larger muscles of the back for movement and
support instead of the neck muscles.

Another common error is lift vector control. Your lift vector should be on
or slightly below the bandit during the initial break turn. Additionally,
max allowable G, chaff/flares and power modulation (2 handed BFM) need
to be used.

A final overall error is failure to analyze the bandit’s pursuit geometry.
Lead and pure pursuit may be hard to discern initially. If the bandit is in
lead, be prepared to jink out-of-plane against a snapshot. Ifthe bandit
stays in pure pursuit, you should expect an overshoot with 90-120°
angle-off, and probably a pass within 2500 feet. If you see lag, the bandit
probably understands how to do BFM! Although a poorer turning bandit
may have to use lag pursuit, continue to fly your best BFM and capitalize
on any errors.

Bandit at 9000 Feet

If acquired in the 5 to 7 o’clock area, at 9000 feet, and presumed to have
overtake, the bandit is near your turn circle. This means that you have
less time to generate angles before the bandit is able to match your turn
rate.

As the bandit is close to valid weapons parameters, you need to
immediately break turn with max allowable G. If ordnance is fired, a
break turn, chaff and flare employment, and immediately slowing to
corner velocity is a must. The goal is to bring the missile to 90° aspect as
quickly as possible and maintain a high LOS with the missile. The range
and aspect at launch dictates how energy depleting your break turn must
be.


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_26.jpeg:
If the attacker’s nose is in lead, you should attempt to analyze the aspect.
A bandit aft of the wing line may be arcing for closure due to lack of
airspeed. In this case you can either attempt to extend away, which may
lead to a missile shot, or continue to turn hard and meet the bandit with
high angles. When a bandit is forward of the wing line, or has the
overtake to effect closure regardless of aspect, you should turn hard with
your lift vector on the bandit to maximize angles and closure. Be prepared
to deny a snapshot.

If the bandit’s nose comes off, the BFM problem you are able to generate
will not be as severe. In other words, generating sufficient aspect to
counter the bandit will be more difficult. If the bandit goes deep to lag, an
optimum turn or extension is probably your best move. However, a bandit
that recognizes your extension early on will quickly drive to your 6 o'clock
and make maintaining a tally difficult. The alternative is to keep turning
at reduced G (4 to 5 Gs) to keep the fight tight, force the bandit to
reposition and bleed off energy attempting to get inside your turn circle.
This should be done at optimum turn (18-22 units) AOA.

Bandit at 6000 Feet

If the bandit is acquired at 5 to 7 o’clock, 6000 feet, and presumed to be
closing, action is critical because any missile-equipped aircraft is already
within weapons parameters.

If the bandit is nose on, a break turn is mandatory. Apply back stick to
achieve maximum allowable G, while modulating power to attain corner
velocity. At the initiation of the break turn, employ chaff and flares.
Approaching corner velocity, select full AB. If you are within 40 knots of
corner or below at the initiation of the turn, maintain full AB. You must
provide a rate problem for both the adversary and any missiles. Assessing
LOS movement is essential to determine if your turn is “working.” If a
missile is in the air, deselect AB and deploy more chaff and flares. Tally is
critical. If the pilot loses tally and calls blind, the WSO is now responsible
for directing defensive maneuvering while talking the pilot’s eyes onto the
bandit.

AAM-6 D - 20


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_27.jpeg:
A bandit that starts at very low aspect and immediately goes to lead
pursuit as you attempt to generate angles is either going for guns or does
not really understand BFM. If the bandit is aft of your wing line and in
lead pursuit, keep your lift vector on and deploy chaff/flares. Unless the
bandit is appreciably nose-off, your turns should be at max allowable G,
with power in mil and deploying chaff/flares. The turn should move the
bandit forward on your canopy. Continue this maximum turn until the
bandit approaches maximum gun range. Then unload and roll to put your
lift vector out of the bandit’s plane of motion and jink. When the bandit’s
nose is no longer in lead, or the bandit is significantly out of plane, unload
and roll to put your lift vector back in a plane parallel with the bandit and
continue the turn.

If the bandit overshoots or repositions, assess the bandit’s movement and
either reverse or reduce G to execute an optimum turn (18-22 units AOA)
to put the bandit in lag, or turn another 30° or so and extend. When
coming back from an extension, you need to turn hard with chaff/flares.
This turn can now be more vertical. Now you are looking for clues of the
bandit’s energy state. How fast is the bandit’s nose coming up? Is the
bandit trapped in lag? Is the nose caught low and inside, out of energy?
Are the bandit’s stabs fully deflected? Your next turn will be above the
bandit until the overshoot and then downhill. When you have the bandit
trapped and out of energy, you can also start an optimum turn (rate fight)
and further neutralize the bandit. Ultimately, you want to separate or
gain the offensive. Generally, it takes less time to separate than go
offensive.


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_28.jpeg:
Bandit with Insufficient Turn Rate

There are two possible reasons for an attacker to go to lag. The first is
that the bandit has insufficient turn rate available to match your turn. If
an inferior turning adversary does not establish lead at sufficient range
against a superior turning aircraft, the attacker will be forced to lag. You
should analyze the aircraft you are fighting (both type and energy state).
If you know you have a turn performance advantage against the bandit
and have forced lag pursuit, keep turning (Figure D-12).

AAM-6 D - 22


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_29.jpeg:
Bandit with Superior Turn Rate

A superior turning bandit may use excess energy to drive to your blind
cone, and then slow the aircraft down by turning harder to point and shoot
unobserved. This maneuver is referred to as a “lag corner” (Figure D-13).

{Fs AAM-06-13

Figure D - 13. Lag Corner.

To counter a lag corner, turn hard to rotate your vulnerable cone and
maintain a tally on the bandit. The farther back the bandit is, the more
effective your turn will be. Once you have increased aspect to the point
that you can maintain a tally, unload to a sustained G (light buffet) and
keep the fight tight. Continue bleeding the bandit’s energy by forcing
repositions out of plane. Be prepared for a guns defense.

Bandit at 3000 Feet
With the bandit at 5 to 7 o’clock and 3000 foot range, action is critical.

Once again, this discussion will be centered on the initial tally at this very
low aspect.

At nose-on you should execute a break turn and attempt to force the
bandit into lag or an overshoot situation. If there is any doubt about nose
position, assume the bandit has established sufficient lead for a gunshot.
You must build angles and increase closure to compound the bandit’s
problem.

Nose in lead requires the initiation of some type of gun defense. A
successful gun attack requires the attacker to be in range, have sufficient
lead and be in your plane of motion. If the attacker has satisfied the first
two requirements, the only option left is to fly out of the attacker’s plane
of motion and bullet stream. How much out of plane is a function of how
long the bandit can maintain a gun attack position. The determining
factors are aspect and overtake. The higher the aspect angle, the more
overtake the attacker will have, assuming you are turning with lift vector
on the bandit. Since the attacker’s position will not be static, as long as
the nose remains in lead the attacker will continue to close and approach
a flight path overshoot. The lower the aspect, the longer the attacker will
maintain a gun firing position because of the lower angular closure and
less HCA.

A gun’s break, or jink, is called for in the higher aspect situation. The
assumption is made here that sufficient aspect has been generated to force
an overshoot, but the attacker has enough lead established approaching
the overshoot point. You must quickly get out of the bandit’s plane of
motion. How much you place your lift vector out of plane depends on the
attacker’s aspect. At 135° of aspect, a roll of probably 30° should be
sufficient. At 45° of aspect, you should do a quick unloaded roll a full 90°
out of the attacker’s plane.

The direction of roll is dependent on several factors: the attacker’s relative
position and vector, the attacker's energy state, your airspeed and your
follow-on intentions. To rotate out of plane, you need to generate turn
rate, and to do this you need airspeed. The rate of your turn is dependent
on radial G, and the effect of gravity is more pronounced at slower speeds.

Your follow-on intentions also determine the direction of break. As
someone closes to gun range, they approach your 3/9 line. If you can
defeat the gun attack, you can then begin to challenge for the 3/9
advantage. The best way to do this is to slow your forward velocity vector
by rotating up and creating a severe closure problem for the attacker.
Remember though, you must first defeat the gun attack by breaking
out-of-plane effectively. Also, you may have to go down in order to
generate sufficient turn rate, even at the expense of a counteroffensive
opportunity. The key here is that after changing your plane of motion

AAM-6 D - 24


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_31.jpeg:
(POM), you need to turn back into the bandit to continue increasing
closure and angle problems.

Gun track defense is called for when the attacker is in a position of low
aspect and controllable overtake so that one single plane defensive move
will not take the attacker out of gun’s position. The problem is to defeat
the initial gun attack with an out-of-plane maneuver while attempting to
force an unsolvable BFM problem that forces the attacker out of this very
lethal position. Guns defense should be unpredictable to the attacker but
predictable to the crew. Have a plan and crew brief it.

An effective guns defense, or jink, consists of three moves. First unload to
break your AOA. This allows you to roll the aircraft quickly. The second
part is a roll to orient your lift vector out of the plane of motion of the
fight. Third, a break turn into your new plane of motion moves the
aircraft out of the attacker’s bullet stream, thus spoiling the shot and
forcing the attacker to maneuver toward the new plane of the fight.

There are several major errors that are often made during any gun
defense. The first is losing tally. To avoid doing this, you should note the
opponent’s position when you initiate the first plane change and predict
where the bandit will go during your defensive maneuver. When you
reorient your lift vector, it may make the bandit move from one side of
your canopy to the other. Know where to find the bandit!

The second most common guns defense error is not initiating the plane of
motion change early enough. Do not wait until the bandit is in gun range
before initiating the plane change. Lead this range by 1-2 seconds (actual
range depends on aspect, closure, and ordnance). This will allow you to
unload, roll and pull to a new plane of motion before the attacker turns
the gun on.

A third error is attempting to roll at high AOA. A rapid plane change is
essential and a slow roll rate may be deadly. Reduce AOA first to achieve
the quickest roll rate, unless the defense is initiated at sufficient airspeed
to guarantee an acceptable roll and turn rate. Surviving a gun attack
takes skill and patience; the most critical error is giving up and settling
into a constant plane turn.


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_32.jpeg:
A fourth error is not getting out of the plane of the fight. While 30-45°
may be sufficient to spoil a high angle gun shot, it is easy to counter for a
bandit at low aspect attempting a guns track. Effectively, all that
happens when you jink in or too near the current plane of motion is that
you solve range problems for the bandit. Think skinny. Related to this is
the tendency to not hold the jink long enough to actually get out of plane.
When you do the break turn, you should note the bandit moving toward
your canopy rails as a key that you are moving out of the plane of motion.

Another error is jinking up with an energy state that is too low. This
causes problems when it is time to jink again. The key is that a single
jink does not make a bandit go away, so you must be prepared for an
attempt by the bandit to solve the problem and you must be prepared to
jink again. Be patient and never give up!

If the attacker’s BFM is timely and effective, and preserves nose/tail
separation, you should continue to pull up into the attacker’s new position
to create a closure problem. As a guide, the move into the vertical should
gain positional advantage. If this move will not gain positional
advantage, a better counter would be an extension while the attacker is
nose off. Attempt to force an “out of sync” situation by pulling toward the
bandit’s belly side, forcing repositions and an ever-changing BFM
problem.

The nose in lag situation is similar to the 6000 foot setup. If the bandit is
forced to lag due to an inferior turn rate, the contest will be won by the
more maneuverable aircraft. If the attacker has superior turn
performance with excess energy and is driving into your blind area to
make a lag corner, you should turn hard until you can maintain a tally
and extend. If the attacker has a small angular problem, this will be a
short extension followed by another break turn. If the bandit is pointed
well behind you at close range, there is a chance the bandit may overshoot
to the outside of your turn. This transition type maneuver is discussed in
the next section.

AAM-6 D - 26


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_33.jpeg:
Transition From the Defensive

In transition maneuvers, if your defensive plan is executed correctly, you
will be afforded an opportunity to separate or force a flight path overshoot,
giving you the chance to reverse and go offensive.

Overshoots
When presented with an unsolvable angular problem, the attacker will

reposition or overshoot (Figure D-14). There are two types of overshoot
geometry.

AAM-06-14

Figure D - 14. Forcing the Overshoot.

The first is a flight path overshoot where the attacker crosses your “smoke
trail” but remains inside your longitudinal axis. If an adversary does this,
it is essential that you continue to turn in the same direction to reacquire
the tally (see the 6000 foot lag) to prevent offering the bandit a low aspect,
low angle-off shot.


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_34.jpeg:
Secondly, there is a longitudinal axis overshoot that will cross the attacker
over to the other side of your aircraft. Your options are now predicated on
three aspects of the overshoot: range, angle-off and closure. The farther
back in range the overshoot occurs, the less likely a role reversal attempt
will succeed. If you cannot reverse and gain the 3/9 line advantage, then
roll to visually acquire the bandit and extend, or turn into the bandit to
force a reposition. The higher the aspect of the attack, the higher the
angle-off will be at the overshoot, the more pronounced the overshoot will
be and the better the likelihood of the defender executing a successful
reversal. The final factor is closure. The more closure the attacker has at
the overshoot, the farther across the longitudinal axis the attacker will go.
The type of overshoot that will allow a role reversal (for similar turning
aircraft) is one where the bandit will come close to your 3/9 line. This
could be anywhere from a high aspect/angle-off co-speed overshoot to a low
aspect/angle-off, high overtake overshoot. The closer the attacker will
pass to your 3/9 line, the less loaded your reversal will have to be to help
the attacker pass your 3/9 line. The farther aft of your 3/9 line the
attacker passes, the more loaded your reversal must be to “help” force the
overshoot.

The key consideration is to confirm the overshoot before executing the
reversal. If in doubt about the reversal, keep the tally and continue
maneuvering in the same direction.

General rules of thumb for reversing are:

e Aspect angle 80-120° (a must, and further predicated by the next
three items)

e Range <3000 feet
e Fast LOS rate

e Low nose rate

Reversals

The next transition maneuver is the reversal (Figure D-15). Not all
overshoots result in a reversal opportunity. If the overshoot occurs at long
range, it should be treated as a 6000 foot nose-in-lag defense. A high
aspect situation enhances the overshoot, but angle-off greater than 90° at
the overshoot results in the bandit ending up aft of your 3/9 line and going
away from you. In this case, a nose-high reversal would leave you slowed
down and probably still defensive.

AAM-06-15

Figure D - 15. Reversal.

If it is not apparent a 3/9 overshoot will occur, you should continue to turn
hard until the overshoot is generated. As the bandit crosses your six,
reduce AOA, roll and reacquire the tally while assessing the bandit’s
potential. If the attacker is well aft of your wing line and remains there,
you should extend. If, however, the attacker is level with you and moving
toward your 3/9 line, set your wings to position your lift vector to the
attacker’s high 6 o'clock and pull to force 3/9 line passage. Your objective
is to stop your lateral movement as quickly as possible. You should not
pull into the bandit’s aircraft, or you will risk flying in front of the bandit’s
nose. This type of reversal can lead to a flat or rolling scissors, if a
definite positional advantage is not gained by the initial pull. If this move
does not gain a shot opportunity, a separation should be initiated by
continuing the pull toward the bandit’s six for HCA, and a nose low
attitude. Unload and roll back to reacquire the tally while extending
away.


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_36.jpeg:
If it is apparent the bandit will overshoot, you may initiate a move prior to
the actual overshoot to gain 3/9 line advantage. If there is sufficient
airspeed to allow a high roll rate while maintaining AOA, a high-G rolling
reversal should be executed by continuing to turn into the bandit and
applying a combination of top rudder and aileron. The advantage of this
reversal technique is that it slows your forward velocity and causes
maximum angular problems for the attacker while initiating
counteroffensive maneuvering. The penalty, however, for an incorrect
assessment is much greater if the bandit makes a move to maintain
positional advantage. You will find yourself nose high, low airspeed and
low on energy. If in doubt, you should turn until the bandit overshoots,
unload, roll and assess your opponent’s situation.

Intercockpit Directive Defensive Commentary

These directive calls assume rear cockpit tally and front cockpit no joy.
Effective crew coordination in the air combat arena is essential for
survival. Mission success may be determined by the quickness and
accuracy of recognition, communication, execution, general aircraft control
and situational awareness in firm understanding of these terms.

“Hard Left/Right”

This directs a defensive turn to prevent an attacker from entering the
defender’s vulnerable cone. Usually combines energy conservation with
turn rate of sufficient intensity to create increasing aspect for an attacker
at longer range. Exact intensity of the turn is a function of the defender’s
energy state and bandit position. As a rule of thumb, start with 5-6 Gs
when above corner velocity (not to exceed configuration G limits) or 22-25
units AOA when below corner velocity. (Note: Your turn is working when
you see forward movement on the canopy.) The pilot should ensure
maximum power is selected and expect this call to be followed
immediately by “Tighten Down/Break Left/Right” or “Ease off/Op turn.”

“Roll Left/Right”

This directs the pilot to roll approximately 10-30° to refine lift vector
placement. If the WSO recognizes the lift vector is oriented slightly above
or below the bandit, call “Roll left/right” or “Roll 20° (degrees) left/right” to
set the lift vector on the attacker. This allows you to maximize your turn
and deny turning room available to the bandit.

AAM-6 D - 30


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_37.jpeg:
“Tighten Down”

This tells the pilot that turn intensity is insufficient for the situation. The
pilot should increase G or AOA (or slow down to turn tighter if above
corner velocity).

“Kase Off/Op Turn”

This tells the pilot that the turn intensity is excessive for the situation.
The pilot should decrease G and AOA and maintain max power. Used to
gain energy while the bandit’s nose is not threatening but a full extension
is unwarranted. This maneuver should be flown at 18-22 units AOA.

“Break Left/Right/Up”

This call is used when a missile launch has occurred or is imminent.
Energy conservation is not a factor. Minimum turn radius and maximum
turn rate are required immediately. The conditions are best achieved at
corner velocity. If called well above corner (500 KCAS+), the pilot should
apply max G allowable, modulate power and use speed brake as required
to slow to corner. Approaching corner, the pilot should reapply maximum
power and get the speed brake in. If called below corner, the pilot should
apply maximum power and maximum obtainable AOA consistent with G
limitations. In both cases, this is a single plane maneuver into the
attacker or the launched missile. Chaff and/or flares should also be
employed with a break turn.

“Reverse Left/Right”

This call is used when a bandit overshoot is in progress and you want to
execute a reversal to attempt to stay and fight. Since you need to
decrease the attacker’s nose-tail separation, loaded roll performance needs
to be optimized. The pilot should maintain the G load and reverse nose
high blending aileron and rudder. The intent here is to increase the
intensity of the bandit overshoot by minimizing nose-tail separation. A
likely follow-on call is “set your wings.”


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_38.jpeg:
“Set Your Wings”

This call is used when a bandit overshoot has occurred. The pilot should
immediately unload to roll quickly with aileron at least far enough to
check the bandit position and reaction. This is not a loaded up, high AOA
rolling-type maneuver. After the roll, expect a follow-up call such as
“pull,” “reverse left/right,” or “hard left/right.”

“Pull”

This call will normally follow a “set the wings” call. With the wings set, a
pull toward the pure vertical will slow or stop horizontal movement and
can generate nose-tail separation with subsequent nose position
advantage. The pilot should pull at maximum AOA limit until the
bandit’s AFT motion against the background has slowed or begun to move
forward.

“Jink”

This call is used to direct a guns defense. Guns jinks are applications of
rolls, accelerations/decelerations and turns which move the aircraft (not
just the controls and control surfaces) and prevent the attacker from
achieving a stabilized guns solution. They should be held just long enough
to establish a new flight path (2-8 seconds). This is a multi-plane,
three-dimensional maneuver. Use caution for G overshoots during the
jinkout as you accelerate past corner velocity. One of the most important
ingredients of a successful jinkout is maintaining tally. Always assess the
bandit’s position after each jink to determine if a follow-on jink is
required.

“Extend”

This is used to gain energy or separate. The pilot should select maximum
power and fly 8-10 units at the call. Rolls can be made at 8-10 units to
maintain tally and/or set the lift vector for future maneuvering.

“Check (Degrees) Left/Right”

The call is used to maintain tally on the bandit during an extension. At
the call, the pilot should generate a hard check turn in the direction
called. Expect a series of check turns and extensions if the bandit
pursues.

AAM-6 D - 32


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_39.jpeg:
“Pitchback Left/Right”

This is used to direct a nose high course reversal from high calibrated
airspeed. The intent is to exchange excess airspeed for altitude, thereby
turning more efficiently and exercising energy management. In maximum
power, the pilot should pull nose high at approximately 6 G (not to exceed
configuration G limits) and pull to simultaneously change heading, reduce
airspeed and gain altitude. The maneuver may resemble a Chandelle,
Immelmann or Half-Cuban Eight. Rollout airspeed will vary based on
how the maneuver is accomplished. Generally, it is a good idea to
terminate with a good tactical minimum of 400 KCAS.

“Sliceback Left/Right”

This is used to direct a nose low course reversal from low or medium
airspeed. The intent is to exchange altitude for instantaneous and
sustained maneuvering capability, thereby exchanging energy for turn
performance. The pilot should roll to position the lift vector below the
horizon and pull to simultaneously change heading, while increasing or
maintaining airspeed. May be done at any power or AOA, but generally
maximum power and AOA to maintain 400 KCAS or greater. Depending
on the situation, this call may be followed by “hard left/right,” “ease off’ or
“rollout.”

“Pitch Left/Right to Slice”

This call is used to direct an efficient course reversal from high calibrated
airspeed. The intent is to sacrifice some energy for a quicker turn. The
pilot should simultaneously pitch up at approximately 6-1/2 G (not to
exceed configuration G limits) and retard power. Play the transition to a
sliceback so that the nose passes down through the horizon near corner
velocity. To continue the maneuver, execute a sliceback as desired.

“Floor”

When fighting BFM, the “floor” is obviously the ground. During training,
an artificial floor will be set accordingly. Most often, the floor is set at
5000 feet AGL or the bottom of the airspace, whichever is higher. You
must consider this floor as the ground, and any floor violation will result
in a floor kill. As most BFM engagements slowly work themselves down
to the floor, it is imperative that one understands the floor fight.


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_4.jpeg:
CRITERION REFERENCED OBJECTIVES (CROs)
1. Identify the basic positional and geometric variables associated
with BFM to include life vector, aspect, angle off and pursuit curves

and how they affect a BFM fight.

2. Identify selected defensive BFM maneuvers, their purpose and
when they should be employed.

AAM-6 B-1


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_40.jpeg:
“Floor Transition”

As a general rule, “he/she who gets to the floor with the most energy
wins.” Additionally, as a defender, the floor can be used as a “weapon” for
an unaware bandit. Since the defender will most often arrive at the floor
first, a timely and well-planned floor transition is important. You must
begin to devote some of your attention to the floor when 4000-5000 feet
above it. As a general technique, begin the floor transition when dive
angle equals 10% of your altitude above the floor. Example: begin the
floor transition when 30° nose low at 8000 feet (assuming a 5000-foot
floor). This should result in a controlled transition and a relatively high
energy state.

“Floor Save”

If you failed to recognize the approaching floor, you must devote all of your
attention to your 12 o’clock, since the PK of the ground is much higher
than the bandit at your 6 o'clock. Once recognized, you must set your
wings level to the horizon and abruptly pull the nose above the horizon.
Based on nose position, energy state and altimeter lag, a cross check of
altitude is important to ensure you have not impacted the floor. This
maneuver is not the best BFM in relation to the bandit, so it is imperative
that once you have defeated the floor, you continue defeating the bandit —
NEVER GIVE UP! Since you have momentarily taken your eyes off the
bandit, a good technique is to reestablish the turn in the same direction
while trying to acquire the bandit again. Once “tally,” you must continue
to fight your best 1 v 1 BFM. Regaining energy will be your first task. Op
turn (if able) at 20 CPU and continue to keep your lift vector on the bandit
while cross checking altitude.

‘

‘Floor Fight”

Once at the floor, you must continue to fight BFM, but your BFM will
change slightly. If you have arrived at the floor with a high energy state
(300 KIAS +) and the bandit’s nose is stuck in lag, a well-performed “Op”
turn (20 CPU) should allow you to rate around the circle, thus increasing
angles and range, and eventually getting to an offensive position. If the
bandit has sufficient energy, he/she may attempt to employ ordnance.
Obviously, guns jinks will be limited in direction. Depending on energy
state and the bandits position, a jink up could be used to force the bandit
into an overshoot situation. Another common technique is to reverse your
direction of turn (a flat scissors). To perform this maneuver, unload, roll
in the opposite direction, break (30 CPU), and then reestablish tally and
refine your lift vector while easing off to 20 CPU. This should result in

Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_41.jpeg:
getting the bandit “out of sync” and again hopefully result in a potential
overshoot situation. Important safety tip: as you reverse your direction,
you are opening up your tail to the bandit and a well-timed flare will
defeat the impending “FOX-II.”

Common DBFM Errors

Common errors during this phase include:

Losing tally
Not maneuvering in relation to the bandit

Not pulling with your lift vector on or slightly below the bandit and
allowing vertical turning room

Extending too long and allowing the bandit to come nose on inside
your vulnerable cone

Poor power control resulting in being too fast with too big a turn
circle, or too slow with no turn rate

Reversing too early, too late or not aggressively enough
Not employing chaff/flares when appropriate
Poorly timed gun jinks

Jinking in plane with the bandit

CONCLUSION

The purpose of this workbook is to provide a logical approach to surviving
an attack by an adversary. There are very few times you want to get
involved in a BFM situation in an F-15E and you NEVER want to get
yourself into a defensive situation. However, if you have somehow
managed to find yourself in one of these engagements, remember three
basic rules:

1. Basic fighter maneuvers are to be accomplished only if required and
only as much as required. They are corrections for the imperfect
setup or to correct errors made by you or forced by the enemy.

2. Continue to maneuver to deny the opponent a shot opportunity.
Never give up!

3. Ifyou can exploit a bandit’s mistakes and become offensive,
maneuver to remain aft of the bandit’s 3/9 line and in position to
shoot. If a shot is not possible, then separate before becoming
defensive.

TEXT
INTRODUCTION

In every conflict since WWI, aircraft have been used to destroy other
aircraft. Although aircraft, weapons and arenas have changed, basic
concepts and basic maneuvering have remained the same. With this in
mind, this workbook covers those basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) that
currently apply to the F-15E and the threat we face.

In air-to-air combat, situations may arise where you will be forced into
defending yourself from an attack until you can either maneuver into an
offensive position of advantage or separate from the fight. To accomplish
this task, you will be required to employ BFM. Basic fighter maneuvers
are not exact maneuvers flown to a specific conclusion, but are
combinations of maneuvers that blend together. The exact combination of
maneuvers depends on a continual assessment of the tactical situation.
Factors that you must analyze include the bandit’s energy state, turn
capability, weapons employment zones (WEZs) based on armament, and
the pursuit curves used (which affects aspect, angle off and range). You
must constantly reassess the effectiveness of your maneuvers versus
reactions by the bandit, thus maintaining a continual process of force,
predict, assess and react until you defeat the bandit by either achieving a
tactical separation, or maneuvering into an offensive position and getting
a kill.

BFM MECHANICS AND DEFINITIONS

BFM is defined as the application of aircraft handling skills to recognize
and solve range, closure, aspect and angle off problems in relation to
another aircraft. In other words, it is the blending of roll, turn and
acceleration to deny or obtain a shot on your opposition.

Roll - Roll allows you to position your lift vector, thus determining the
plane of motion in which you turn. Roll also aids you in keeping sight of
the bandit.

e = Lift vector placement is critical to success in defensive BFM (DBFM).
The lift vector can be visualized under high-G as a vertical plane
extending up through the top of the canopy, perpendicular to the
aircraft’s wings.


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_8.jpeg:
e A maximum rate defensive break turn with the lift vector directly on
the bandit generates the most angles and decreases range. This
effectively denies turning room the bandit may otherwise be able to
exploit.

e Since a pilot normally sits at an angle looking backward over his
shoulders during DBFM, a common tendency is to orient the lift
vector either above or below the bandit. Imagining the lift vector
going straight up between the tails of the F-15E may help a pilot
“visualize” proper placement of the lift vector.

Turn - A turn (which is the most fundamental of the basic fighter
maneuvers) allows you to defeat your bandit’s attack/weapons
employment zones. As your instructor will show you, optimum or max
turns can be defined by aircraft angle of attack.

Break turn - A maximum performance (max) turn.
Hard turn - A energy sustaining turn.

Acceleration - Energy is an extremely important commodity during
air-to-air maneuvering. Your aircraft will not do everything you want it to
and maintain a high energy state. Thus, you will often find the need to
preserve or regain energy. To preserve or gain some energy, a well flown
optimum turn (“opt turn”) can be flown in the 18-22 units AOA regime.
The quickest way to regain energy is through a well-executed extension at
8-10 units AOA. Although getting your energy back is your main goal,
keep these factors in mind.

e Be aware of your nose position and do not allow it to get buried.
Giving up your newly gained energy to avoid the floor and/or giving
the bandit vertical turning room to enter a WEZ may be the end
result of a poorly flown acceleration.

e Becognizant of your attitude (do not try to accelerate going up),
altitude (if you hit the ground you have finished the enemy's job) and
airspeed (if you are slow, acceleration will take longer). There is a
constant trade off between energy and nose position when flying
BFM.

e Holding an acceleration too long will give the bandit an angular
advantage and may not be worth the extra airspeed.

AAM-6 D-2


Text from AAM-6_DBFM_page_9.jpeg:
e Best acceleration occurs at MIN DRAG (8-10 AOA) and MAX AB at
speeds between 300-450 KCAS due to thrust/drag balances.

BFM and Aircraft Feel

Successful energy management is often the key element in determining
the outcome of a maneuvering fight. The challenge of energy
management is to know your aircraft’s envelope and to develop a
“heads-up” feel for aircraft performance and energy state since you will be
looking over your shoulder trying to keep a tally on the bandit. AOA
control is essential in performing each of the basic maneuvers. Figure D-1
illustrates some key numbers that provide a reference for “max
performing” the Strike Eagle. A rule of thumb for max performing the
Strike Eagle is to fly at 8/18/28 or 10/20/30 AOA and not in between.

Geometry

To successfully execute DBFM, you must understand the geometric
relationship between your aircraft and an attacker and how it affects
weapon employment capability. The spatial relationship of two aircraft
can be analyzed from three perspectives: positional geometry, attack
geometry and weapon envelope.

Available Assets

The assets dedicated or available for your package will be spelled out in
the ATO. You must consider all of them when planning the mission.
Tanker numbers and track location will influence your marshal plan,
divert fuel, refueling priority, boom time and availability. An
often-neglected portion of mission planning is how to incorporate
GCI/AWACS into your plan; you must know their capabilities and
limitations. Know what to expect in terms of communications, frequency
usage, chattermark procedures and levels of control. You also need to be
aware of GCI radio/radar blind zones, as they may affect your CAP and/or
search. In circumstances where you can prebrief your controller, be as
specific as possible concerning your commit and engagement criteria, flow
plan and degraded operations options. No GCI is better than bad GCI—do
not contribute to bad GCI by keeping secrets. Consider the controller’s
additional wingmen and brief them accordingly. Include an
environmental brief on your check-in.

All other assets (A/A players, SEAD, other strikers, etc.) will impact your
plan. You need to ensure the plan incorporates them all and provides for
combined force employment.

Combat Air Patrol (CAP)

There are many things to consider as you enter the area. First, ensure the
fence check, trigger check and alpha checks are complete. Next, check the
environment and compare it to the weather brief. Note whether it is
difficult to see the F-15E looking up or down and where the sun is; this
could affect the flow direction of your intercept. Next, check the winds;
they will affect the GMTR setting (above ~50 knots for GMTR chaff). SYS
ALT RESET should be accomplished (prior to EGI installation) because
the radar uses system altitude to display altitudes. Consider all of these
factors (along with the airspace restrictions, AOR, etc.) to determine how
the environment will affect your intercepts. Finally, take alibis from the
formation for information on how our systems are working and if the
intercept plan has to be altered due to limiting factors (limfacs).

There are many different types of CAPs. (See AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17,

Chapter 15 for a detailed discussion of each.) Each type has different
considerations for employment.

AAM-7 D-4


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_11.jpeg:
The CAP is the starting point of the intercept. The principles of the CAP
are proper orientation and placement, use of command, control and
communications when off threat axis, ensuring adequate time and look
angle for search, and preservation of intercept room until committed. The
objectives of the CAP are building a mental three-dimensional picture of
the presentation, making a sound commit decision and committing from
the CAP in the desired formation. Notice that the CAP objectives do not
include labeling the picture. In general, the CAP phase is too early to
begin labeling the picture because it will likely change between the actual
commit and the targeting/shooting phase.

The CAP briefing includes length, location, altitude and formation in the
CAP, or the marshalling point prior to the commit. As a two-ship, you can
expect a fluid formation until the commit. Usually the hot leg (the one
with radars pointed down track) is slower than the cold leg to maximize
radar look time. It is important to CAP in the proper location to ensure
the opportunity to commit early enough to engage bandits in the desired
engagement zone (DEZ).

Another important element of the CAP is the “talker” priority order. On
the hot leg it is usually lead - GCI — wingman. On the cold leg, it is
usually GCI — lead — wingman.

Many factors affect the different CAP considerations. For CAP altitude,
factors include weather, fuel considerations, anticipated threats, terrain,
dissimilar formations and radar footprints. CAP speed factors include fuel
considerations, GCI availability and threat proximity. As a ROT, if in the
mid 20s use 350 CAS, and .9 M if in the 30s. Turns in the CAP will be
based on CAP geometry, winds at altitude and flight lead preference. The
flight lead should brief all CAP parameters and expectations.

Radar Setup

Radar setup is one of the most important aspects of the intercept. It is
extremely important to tailor your radar setup to the tactical and
environmental situation you expect. The following key terms and
concepts will give you a basis for your radar setup decisions. Actual radar
game plans are discussed in AFTTP 3-1.


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_12.jpeg:
PRE

Interleaved PRF is generally the best option for threat detection at all
aspects and long-range. Consider other waveforms when specific threat
parameters (high fast fliers, EW environment, etc.) are known. MPRF
makes it easier to break out formations and helps with maneuvering
contacts, especially those at or near the beam. It also reduces the IPRF
range ambiguities, but sacrifices longer-range detection due to decreased
power output. Remember that MPRF gains down below 5000' and may
increase false returns (“birds”) at low altitude.

Scope Range

Determine the minimum range necessary to detect the threat, analyze
geometry and threat maneuvers, and still have room for the commit (i.e.,
room to establish the DEZ). Set scope range to search this minimum
range and beyond, considering the factor bandit range.

Azimuth Selection

Consider limiting azimuth selection when a single threat axis is available
(lane assignment) and/or when GCI/AWACS coverage will supplement
your own radar coverage.

Frame Store

The primary consideration is crew workload. If one crew member can
spend adequate time in radar interpretation, frame store 1 may be
adequate. If crew duties do not leave much time for radar interpretation,
consider frame store 2. Remember, however, that use of a frame store
option higher than you normally use can be more confusing than helpful.

GMTR

Four GMTR settings are available: LO, MED, HI and CHF. Each setting
sets specific velocity filters for target detection and radar blind zones in
medium PRF. The chaff setting invokes special logic for search, TWS and
manual acquisition functions (not track) in a chaff environment. Your
own altitude, winds, threat axis and probability of encountering chaff
determine the optimum GMTR setting for the mission. Lower GMTR
settings may be necessary for missions requiring detection of slow speed
targets.

Acquisition Symbol Placement

A prebriefed range must be specified to ensure that all flight members are
using the same range to set the altitude coverage. If different reference
ranges are used, gaps in the search coverage may occur. A ROT is to use
meld range (discussed later) as the acq symbol placement range.

Altitude Search Selection

Altitude sanitization and division of elevation area of responsibility (AOR)
are important factors in building a complete picture. Set up scope range
as desired (40-80 nm) with acquisition symbols at briefed meld range.
Divide the elevation coverage into high and low search to build a complete
picture. Overlap radar coverage at least 2000 feet at meld range to avoid
unintentional coverage holes. Refer to Table D-1 in the following example.
If the AOR is 20,000-40,000 feet MSL with acq symbols at 20 nm, it is
impossible to cover this AOR in either 4- or 6-bar. Selecting 4-bar
provides 12,000 feet of coverage, while 6-bar provides 16,000 feet. In
either case, the elevation scan will have to be moved. If using 4-bar, the
scan can be moved in 14" versus 21" for 6-bar (assumes 120° sweep).
However, if the AOR remains the same but the briefed acq symbol range
becomes 25 nm, the 6-bar is a more effective means of covering the AOR.
The bottom line is that by increasing the bar scan from 4 to 6, you get a
33 percent increase in altitude coverage, offset with a 50 percent increase
in search time.

Table D - 1.


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_14.jpeg:
Elevation Coverage — Bar Selection

Time to build each radar frame is determined by sweep rate, number of
bars per frame and azimuth width. Some considerations for limiting
altitude coverage are contrail level, GCI/AWACS coverage, workload,
limited altitude area of responsibility, radar footprint and radar
desensitization.

Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS) and Mission Planning
Support System (MPSS)

The AFMSS and its more modern replacement, the MPSS, are useful tools
for planning and preparing mission data; they will be referred to
collectively as MPSS for purposes of this workbook. Flight planning, fuel
consideration data, mission routes, bull’s-eye points, airspace
restrictions/definitions and offset points can all be generated by MPSS.
Some key mission items that the crew may want displayed in the aircraft
(TSD, radar, INS), as well as communication plans, IFF phasing,
munitions loads and jettison programs can all be loaded in the DTM.

Communication Plan

The first step is to refer to the ATO and SPINs for the current frequency
list. Review the daily ATO for comm plan changes. Determine which
frequencies you are most likely to use and load those in the radio
channels. However, there should be a copy of the complete frequency plan
in the aircraft. Also consider authentication procedures; the ATO should
specify the current authenticators as well as backup and emergency
authentication procedures. Be familiar with each authenticator’s use.
Confirm KY-58 fills are loaded (through 781) and control head is set to
remote (for UFC operation). The same considerations are true for the
Have Quick radio. The time and duration of the flight may require more
than one period of authenticators, frequency plan, Have Quick
frequencies, etc. For Have Quick, consider loading two periods, one in
each radio. Also, note that multiple WODs (Have Quick IT) can be loaded
through the AFMSS for both radios. There may be situations where HQ I
is directed, others where HQ II is directed.

AAM-7 D-8


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_15.jpeg:
DTM List and Sequence Points

A common tendency is to try to display too much data; display only the
data that is essential to the mission. Sequence points and/or list points
can be used for more than defining the route; they can be used as
references for possible contingencies (alternate tanker tracks, divert fields,
etc.), outlining AORs, lanes, known troop concentrations, dump targets,
etc. Use the different mission symbols (sequence, offset, aim and target
points) to determine particular points or areas of interest. For land or
sector caps, points can be entered to define the edges or corners of your
flight’s AOR. This information (your AOR) then appears on the radar
scope and/or TSD, allowing quick assessment of whether the bandit is in
your area or not. Remember that you can display one route on the TSD
while steering to another (and displaying it on the radar). Remember,
when preparing a DTM route load to organize the data points, try not to
display too much data and restore the DTM load to the squadron standard
load (if applicable) at the end of the mission.

IFF Phasing

IFF modes and codes can be programmed for the mission and AAI can be
slaved to the phased IFF. Phasing occurs on the central computer time
(Data 1), so aircrews must ensure phasing and aircraft clock are both
based on the same time (local or Zulu). Remember that EGI defaults the
CC clock to Zulu time. Also, when AAT is slaved to IFF phasing, IFF mode
changes (either manual or phased) force AAI codes to match currently
selected Modes 1 and 3, and AAI Modes 1/2/38 default to correct code.

Aircrew and HUD Data

The aircrew has the option of programming display, scrolling and master
mode selections. HUD titling data and default radar settings for MRM
and SRM can be specified.

Ordnance
The aircrew can specify ordnance loads for combat and training PACS,

both A/A and A/G, and combat jettison options. Configuration data is
used to generate takeoff and landing data (TOLD) information.


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_16.jpeg:
Crew Coordination

The F-15E, with its ordnance (AIM-120s/-7s/-9s), BVR sensors (APG-70,
A/A targeting pod, TEWS, etc.) and within-visual-range tools (large HUD,
auto acq modes), is able to effectively engage any platform in the world.
Having two crew members in the jet has proven to be an important part of
the F-15E’s success or failure. However, the complexity of the mission,
weapons and aircraft systems, and aircrew training and proficiency
frequently make crew coordination the “weak link” in the chain. In
addition to the “standard” crew coordination brief covering all the
administrative duties (EPs, ground ops, system management and other
tasks), a tactical mission demands additional important items.

For a typical air-to-air engagement, crew coordination includes:

e Radar: Who will control the radar during each phase of the
intercept? Considerations should include proficiency,
day/night, medium/low altitude. Pilots must never assume it
is not their job to control the radar. Likewise, WSOs should
not assume the radar belongs to them.

e Targeting pod: Who will operate the A/A targeting pod?
Generally, the crew member not operating the radar should
operate the targeting pod. However, there are times when
one person can and will operate both sensors at once.

e RWR: Who is primarily responsible for the RWR?
Proficiency allowing, both crew members should strive to
include the RWR in their cross-check.

e CMD: Who dispenses CMD and when? How much is
dispensed for each actuation?

As the F-15E continues to evolve (i.e., fighter data link with OFP Suite 4),
crew coordination will become even more vital (and complex) to the
success of the mission. Both pilots and WSOs should strive to be experts
on every system on the aircraft. This will make crew coordination more
efficient and your aircraft more deadly.

AAM-7 D-10


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_17.jpeg:
Visual Lookout

Visual lookout must be crew coordinated prior to the mission. AF TTP 3-8,
Volume XVII has a section devoted to responsibilities and visual search
techniques; this is a “must read.” Each crew must “cage” their clock
positions and elevation descriptions prior to any A/A engagement. This
should consist of using references on the ground and again in the air to
ensure that your “2 o’clock 10 low” is the same as the other crew
member’s. The crew brief should include some kind of system for
deconfliction of effort. One technique is for the WSO to deconflict by
watching the pilot’s head and searching a different piece of sky; another
technique is to be descriptive about where you are searching; e.g., “?M
HIGH, OUTSIDE ....”

Intercockpit Communication

Communication between cockpits should be minimized and limited to
mission essential information. AFTTP 3-1 lists communication brevity
words that apply to intercockpit communication. Normally, each
squadron has additional “standard” comm. Use these as much as possible
to limit self-induced comm jamming. Do not shortchange this important
element in the crew brief. If you have specific information you want at a
particular time, in a particular format, brief it!

Contingency Planning

There are several types of contingency planning, including overall
package/mission contingencies and flight A/A game plan contingencies.
We will address overall contingencies here and game plan contingencies
later.

Weather

Mission planning must include a bad-weather plan for all aspects of the
mission, which include marshal deconfliction, attack deconfliction,
weapons delivery, threat assessment, tanker plan, etc. Minimum weather
requirements may be spelled out in the ATO.


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_18.jpeg:
Package Fallout/Late

You need to consider the minimum assets necessary to accomplish your
mission. How many A/A players are required? What is the limited tanker
plan? What is the minimum SEAD package required? How long can the
mission be slipped and what are the procedures for ensuring that all
players get the word? Again, many of these may be spelled out in the
ATO and will differ from mission to mission. Remember that many of
your assets may be coming from different bases or AORs.

Intercept Geometry/Tactics

The objective of the intercept is to position the flight to kill groups while
avoiding being killed. The goal of the intercept is to use proper geometry
to place the flight in a positional advantage while maximizing time
available to work the radar. This is accomplished by maximizing the
F-15E’s WEZ while minimizing the bandit’s WEZ.

The basic game plan is mission, threat and weapons load dependent.
These factors plus the number of threat groups will dictate if launch and
leave (LL) or launch and decide (LD) tactics should be employed. Risk
level is also important and should be spelled out by HHQ. As a ROT, use
the following guidelines:

e High risk: We are willing to accept potential losses due to a
merge.

e Medium risk: A merge is not desirable, but is acceptable.

e Low risk: Losses or a merge is not acceptable.

Launch and Leave

Taking shots and performing an out/abort maneuver outside of
decision/abort range performs the launch and leave tactic. It ensures
defeating the bandit’s WEZ and avoiding a merge. Launch and leave
tactics will usually need to be performed from medium altitude if any
shots need to be taken. Due to reduced shot ranges, launch and leave
from low altitude is almost impossible.

AAM-7 D-12


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_19.jpeg:
Launch and Decide

The basic flow should initially heat up the intercept, then WEZ manage
outside of the bandit’s maximum shot range (typically outside our meld
range). Target, take shots and crank to continue WEZ management and
F-pole. Launch and decide tactics normally assume a continuous flow
toward the target/bandits, which is also known as “worming” to the merge
(“bonsai”). However, the “skate” (launch and leave) option can also be
performed if A-pole/F-pole range allows—hence the “decide” portion of the
name. Both tactics are discussed in depth in AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17,
Chapter 15.

An offset slows the intercept down, allowing time to build the picture
when bandits are maneuvering, run the ID matrix and start the WEZ
management process. Generally, wingmen will offset outside the flight,
allowing a visual search toward the bandits that goes through lead, which
simplifies visual lookout and position keeping. The 30° scribe on the radar
works well for establishing offset while keeping contacts on all radars.

Group targeting plans and problems drive intercept options. Two
considerations that must be applied to each intercept are factor bandit
range (FBR) and shot depth (SD). FBR is the minimum range between
threat groups that allows the F-15E to achieve F-pole on the closest group
and still maintain first launch opportunity (FLO) on all groups outside of
this range. All groups within this range must be targeted. Groups
outside FBR can be subsequently engaged or avoided. In order to
maximize firepower, groups that fall outside FBR should not be included
in initial targeting. Threat weapons capability, F-15E weapons capability,
closure and proficiency drive FBR. Shot depth (SD) is how far missile
shots will be taken into groups. SD is tactic dependent and will be
different when using launch and decide (LD) or launch and leave (LL).
Rules of thumb for FBR, SD and threat WEZs can be found in AFTTP 3-1,
Volume 17, Chapter 15. Three intercept options often briefed are CATA,
the single-side offset and the bracket.

CATA

This intercept type is the fastest and allows the maximum range shot. It
consists of finding the enemy, putting him on the CATA and running hot
until shot range. The disadvantages are decreased time to picture build,
target/sort, EID and shoot. It also solves his intercept problem for him.

Single-Side Offset

The element takes offset on one side of the bandit formation (Figure D-1).
The goal is to use the superior F-15E radar capability to detect the target
and offset the formation. It is imperative that the wingman maneuver to
the deployed position immediately.

Between initial offset range and pure pursuit range, the flight assesses
the bandit(s), sorts or makes targeting assignments and employs
ordnance. The wingman’s position is critical for the sort plan, visual
lookout and radar gimbal protection.

e Once the bracket starts to develop, any bandit reaction results in
turning room for at least one F-15E.

e At least one F-15E sees enough profile for a VID.

e Good visual lookout until bracket develops.

Disadvantages

Another contingency is a late threat detection where your flight has been
bracketed and there is not enough intercept room to enter from the
outside. Now the flight will be forced to split and perform an inside-out
intercept (Figure D-3).

Hook-ID

Since no flight or intercept is ever perfect, contingencies must be planned
to cover the most likely breakdowns or problems. Several of these
problems can be discussed together. These are single-radar plan, forced
VID or radar/missile problems in one aircraft. To overcome these
contingencies, use a hotter single-side offset with the bad radar/wingman
deployed in a position to employ ordnance upon lead arriving at the merge
and declaring the contact hostile or timing out his shots. This profile is
commonly called the hook-ID and puts the wingman in a favorable
offensive position at the merge (Figure D-4).

INTERCEPT BASICS

An air-to-air game plan is based on many things. The following discussion
of air-to-air game plan and mechanics is very general in nature and does
not presume any of the following:

Mission (OCA, DCA)

Flight makeup (two-ship, four-ship)

Risk level (high, medium, low)

Tactic (launch and leave, launch and decide)

Radar versus group (may include multitargeting with
AIM-120s), radar versus contact

Ordnance (AIM-120s/-7s/-9s)
Missile management (desired missile/contact ratio)

Threat (long-burn radar, short-burn radar, limited-aspect
radar, heat).

Every air-to-air game plan should take these variables into consideration
and be built around them. Remember that the air-to-air plan is never
“standard’—only bits and pieces of it are.

During the planning process, your “range ladder” should account for the
above variables. In general, your range ladder should produce a blue air
first launch opportunity (FLO) and should be built back from that
predicted range. Aircrew should memorize missile shot range rules of
thumb for different missiles at different shooter altitudes.


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_29.jpeg:
As you plan, brief, execute and debrief the A/A plan, continually ask the
following three questions:

1. Formation: Lead — are you executing the briefed flow,
intercept and tactics? Wingman — are you in position or
correcting to be there?

Zz. Radar: Lead/wingman — are you in your assigned AOR or
targeting IAW the plan or lead’s directive?

3. Communication: Lead/wingman — are you using brevity,
following the comm flow plan, listening and hearing?

Communication and Picture Building

The ability to engage the enemy requires the use of clear, concise,
accurate, situational awareness-building communications. In short,
effective communications can make or break the intercept. This does not
mean talking excessively.

The two most important factors in an efficient, effective comm plan are
brevity and accuracy. Of these two, accuracy is paramount. We always
strive to communicate IAW AFTTP 3-1, but there may be times when
plain English is required to communicate accurately. Additional keys to
communication are listening and good pacing. You will not communicate
well if you do not listen and build a picture based on what you hear. Also,
there is no communication if everyone is stepping on one another. Brief a
comm flow (i.e., GCI, Eagle 1, Eagle 3) and then adhere to it. If your back
is to the fight, GCI is the primary talker, followed by lead, then number
two. If your radars are pointing down track, the fighters should talk with
GCI filling in. A good flow of communication will set the stage for a fluid,
error-free intercept.

The discussion of B/E versus BRA is normally a heated debate. In most
instances, B/E comm makes the most sense to the fighters as well as other
blue air assets (F-15Cs, AWACS, GCI, etc.). BRA format should be used
only when it makes sense (““POP-UP” “GROUP,” F-15Ks are together).
Preface all calls with “BULL’S-EYE” or “BRA” unless otherwise briefed.
Reference AFTTP 3-1 guidelines for proper communication
recommendations. This comm plan is a CAF-wide standard used by
AWACS, GCI, F-15C, etc. Attachment 1 to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 1 (Dec
99) contains brevity words and terminology.

Calling the Picture and Labels

Fundamentals

Group criteria will be [AW AFTTP 3-1, which is currently 3 nm (as an
addition, use 15,000' altitude). Group definition may be briefed
nonstandard (i.e., 5 nm, 10,000'). A group is nothing more than a hit on
your radar scope. A group may have one, two or more contacts within it.
For example, four MiG-29s flying in close formation would be a single
group. Depending on their inner-group distance, your radar beam width
and your distance from them, your radar may begin to break the
individual contacts out of the group. If two MiG-29s were flying line
abreast, 10 nm from one another, your radar scope presentation would be
two groups. As the MiGs get closer, you may be able to determine each
group contains only one MiG (single contact).

“BULL’S-EYE” or “BRA” will preface all calls to reduce or eliminate
ambiguity. Digital bull’s-eye is the format that will be used for
bull’s-eye-referenced calls (the eight cardinal directions will not normally
be used).

A full call sign will be associated with every radio transmission.

Core information will include the number of groups, bull’s-eye location,
altitude and tracking direction. One group will be called “GROUP,” not
“single group.” In addition, when using core information to anchor the
location of groups, do not say “... FIRST GROUP B/E 360/10, SECOND
GROUP B/E 040/20”. Just call them “GROUP’—no number—and anchor
the location (e.g., “... GROUP B/E 360/10, GROUP B/E 040/20”).

If an aircrew member has amplifying information on a group, they should
use the group’s location. For example, “EAGLE 1, GROUP B/E 360/10,
HITS 35,000.” By sticking to this rule, aircrew will avoid the ambiguous
type call (e.g., “EAGLE 1, HITS 2ND GROUP, 35,000”). Groups within

5 nm of the B/E will be labeled “over bull.”

For anchoring group location, the group closest to the fighters will be
anchored off bull’s-eye first, followed by the next closest, and so on. If
multiple groups are equal distance from the fighters, the group closest to
the bull’s-eye will be anchored first.

AAM-7 D - 24


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_31.jpeg:
If more than three groups are detected, aircrew will call the number of
groups, but will only anchor the closest group to the fighters. For
example, “EAGLE 1, 4 GROUPS, CLOSEST GROUP BULL’S-EYE
270/25, HITS 15,000, FLANK WEST.”

Fill-in information should include (but is not limited to) number of
contacts within a group, the inner-group formation, eyeballs and any ID
criteria met (i.e., “SPADES”).

Labeling the picture will help fighter targeting and help the flight lead
decide how to direct the actual intercept geometry and targeting. For
example, a wide azimuth presentation may warrant a single-side offset
type intercept while a pure range presentation may call for a hotter, pure
intercept. Attempt to establish a group picture prior to targeting/meld
range or bypass labeling altogether—use only core information. Common
sense and the tactical presentation should drive labeling. Some general
rules of thumb for when to label are:

e Fighters have committed, bogies/bandits are on a steady
heading (2 or more hits), formation is determinable and
labeling will help aircrew SA.

e Groups are within bounding range (one package). Groups
within a specific range (i.e., 25 nm) will be a package.
Groups outside bounding range will be labeled second
package.

Before reviewing the various picture labels, it is important to remember
not to “force the picture.” If one of the following picture labels does not
apply to your particular presentation, it is best to simply call each group
out one by one with respect to B/E than to try and make a predefined
picture label fit.

As for the labels used to describe two groups, there are two major
categories: azimuth and range. If the groups are an azimuth
relationship, name the groups using the four cardinal directions; i.e.,
northern, southern, etc. If the groups are in a range relationship, name
the groups using “LEAD GROUP” and “TRAIL GROUP.” The use of
“SIDE-SIDE” and “NEAR-FAR’” are reserved for inner-group relationships
(i.e., sorting).


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_32.jpeg:
A possible fill-in to a presentation is “ECHELON.” If the two echelon
groups are wider than they are long, call “... TWO GROUPS, AZIMUTH
SPLIT 10, ECHELON NORTHWEST, SOUTHERN B/E ....” Ifthe two
echelon groups are longer than they are wide, call “... 2 GROUPS, RANGE
SPLIT 10, KCHELON SOUTHWEST, LEAD GROUP B/E ....”

Other labels are used when we are faced with three or more groups. Some
examples of these three or more group presentations are wall, ladder,

champagne and vic (Figures D-5 and D-6).

For three or more group labels, the range or azimuth split called is the
distance between the outer edges.

Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_33.jpeg:
In a four-group wall, name the outside groups with cardinal directions, as
in a two-group azimuth, “northern” and “southern.” The other groups
inside the wall can be called as “southern middle” and “northern middle.”
For example, Eagle 1 calls “... LOCKED B/E 270/10, 25,000.” By using
the names mentioned above, Eagle 2 can respond, “EAGLE 1, YOU'RE
LOCKED NORTHERN GROUP, NORTHERN MIDDLE GROUP B/E
230/14.”

IAW AFTTP 3-1 definitions, champagne is an attack of three distinct
groups with two in front and one behind. The leading two groups are
attempting to bracket with the trailing third group flying up the middle.
Vic is defined as three groups/contacts with a single closest in range and
an element/two groups in trail. When calling the distances between
groups in a champagne, the azimuth split will be called first and the range
split will be called in the next transmission. When calling the distances
between groups in a vic, the range split will be called first, then the
azimuth split in the next transmission. (Currently, AFTTP 3-1,

Volume 17 directs champagne and vic labels to be called the same; e.g.,
azimuth first, then range.) However, if it looks only slightly like a
champagne or vic, it will be called a three-ship wall.

In a vic, the group closest to the fighters will be called the lead group and
the other two will be called “TRAILERS” (northern trailer and southern
trailer in a vic headed east toward the fighters).

In champagne, the two groups closest to the fighters will be called lead
groups, and the group closest to the fighters will be anchored off B/E. The
third group in a champagne will be called the “TRAILER.”

IAW AFTTP 3-1, Volume 1, if aircrews see more than three contacts, but
the specified number cannot be accurately determined, “HEAVY” will be
used by itself. However, if aircrews can accurately count the number of
contacts in a group, they will provide the specific number of contacts.

For maneuvering groups, recognize and call the maneuver. For example,
“EAGLE 1, LEAD GROUP MANEUVER.” After the group is steady on a
heading, call the group “FLANKING/BEAMING/DRAGGING.”

In general, if a previously reported group is not processed for two
consecutive sweeps, it will be reported as “FADED” and the term
“ESTIMATE” will be used to anchor where it faded.

Labels may be changed by calling “NEW PICTURE.” However, labels will
not be changed inside a prebriefed range (typically meld range). If no
such range is prebriefed, use the briefed targeting/meld range as the
cutoff.

If aircrews detect a previously unreported group, a “NEW PICTURE” may
need to be called. If the group is detected outside meld/target range, it
will be called a new group and anchored off B/E. Then call a new picture
if able; e.g., “EAGLE 1, NEW PICTURE, THREE-GROUP LADDER,

Intercept Flow

The overall flow of the intercept is based on several factors. These include
environmentals (“Can we come out of the sun, isolate against a cloud deck,
etc.?”), package flow (“Is the package we are defending going a particular
direction? We do not want to drag the threat to the strike package.”), our
prebriefed tactics (CATA, SSO or bracket), desired intercept geometry
(perhaps the most important factor), etc. The flow is important to build
overall SA of the flight and the rest of the package during and after
engagements, and can be broken down into several different phases.

Search

Search responsibilities are assigned in the briefing. Give some thought to
your radar coverage and base it on threat, experience level, AOR and
radar setup. Figure D-9 shows typical overlapping search blocks.
Typically, leads will search an AOR in which they expect the threat.
Initially search in 120° sweep (except in turns) until all factor groups can
be contained in a narrower sweep. At an acq symbol placement of 25 nm,
120° gives 50 nm of azimuth coverage.

AAM-07-09

Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_38.jpeg:
It is important to search the extremes of your coverage first. The footprint of
the radar is smaller at the extremes and it is easier for a bandit to fly
through your coverage where the footprint is small (Figure D-10).

Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_39.jpeg:
The two most important things to remember when searching with the radar
are discipline and patience. Discipline means sanitizing your area of
responsibility by staying in it. To properly sanitize you must use the briefed
acq symbol placement when setting your coverage. Then, move you acq
symbols to the expected azimuth and range of the bandits. Moving your acq
symbols to the predicted (or called) range of the targets will help you build a
mental picture of the presentation and will optimize HPRF at that range.
Use flight mates, AWACS, GCI, etc. to build a picture of what is happening
outside your AOR. Listen and be patient. Patience means allowing the radar
to do the work; e.g., ensuring a full sweep before resetting your coverage.
How do you know your radar has done a full sweep? You can hack a clock
(21 seconds for two full sweeps in 6-bar, INLV) or look at the bottom left of
your radar scope where it shows the bar scan of the radar. When that scan
comes up again, the radar has finished one full sweep. For example, the
radar reads 6 MED when you look at it; when it reads 6 MED again, it has
swept two full times.

Learn how to interpret the radar scope. The radar screen is twice as wide as
itis long. For example, at the 20 mile range bar, 120° sweep is 40 miles wide.
Further, the width of one 30° block on the radar equates to 2 the range (i.e.,
at 60 nm, one block is 60/2 = 30 miles wide; at 40 nm, one block is 40/2 = 20
miles wide). Finally, the acq symbols are roughly 6° wide—at 30 miles, they
are 3 miles wide (as a rule of thumb, acq range equals distance across). In
addition, altitude is given in RWS with acq symbols over a contact (accurate
+/- 5000'). All of these things can help you build a picture and make good,
SA-building calls without locking. This allows you to continue looking at the
big picture.

One last issue is TWS. Avoid using TWS within meld +5 nm to meld, unless
targeting with a radar-versus-group plan. In any case, NEVER try to search
with TWS; it has too small a search block to be effective as a search tool.

Sample

Once groups are detected, the flight must build SA on them. Are they bandits
or friendlies, are they hot or cold, high or low, fast or slow, etc.? Single target
track (STT) gives the most information on a specific target but other systems
can assist in determining information about a group. EWWS, TWS, acq
symbol/altitude coffin, AAI, EID, NCTR, Highlight mode and apparent drift
can give data on various groups. This information will be used to determine
if a commit should be initiated. Fast targets require a hotter intercept profile
than slow targets. Ifthe primary game plan is an offset intercept, a hot
target (16 AA) requires more maneuvering to gain the offset than a colder
target. Note the displayed shot ranges during a sample lock. They will give
you a good indication of when to take your final lock or how to modify your
other ranges (target, meld, sort, LNLT, etc.). Also, depending on ID criteria,
STT or HDTWS may be needed for an NCTR. Remember that the longer you
are locked to a specific target, the lower your SA on what the rest of the group
is doing or what is happening with other groups.

AAT/EID/PID

In today’s BVR environment, electronic identification is critical. Getting a
“HOSTILE” call out early gets you in the mindset of killing early in the
intercept. On the other hand, a quick “FRIENDLY” call can free your brain
from trying to keep track of someone who is not trying to kill you. EID can be
accomplished without locking a target and can be used to ensure “clear field
of fire” to the bandit. If you see a friendly reply, do not lock.

With our avionics, AAI and EID use can be confusing. A sound technique is
to set up the EID to the criteria spelled out in the ROEs. Set the AAI to find
flight members. Get in the habit of going aft in the RCP and inboard in the
FCP to determine which contacts are bandits. The bottom line is do not shoot
diamonds, whether in AAI or EID.

AAM-7 D - 34


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_41.jpeg:
Some important terms for identification criteria and communication follow.

e BANDIT — a positively identified enemy aircraft. The term is a
function of identification and does not necessarily imply
direction or authority to engage.

e Hostile — a bandit upon which clearance to fire is authorized
IAW theater ROEs.

The requirements to satisfy BVR ID criteria will be sortie/scenario
dependent. The identification matrix required to ID a group “HOSTILE”
might include the need to have a positive enemy indication, a lack of friendly
indication or both. In addition, a visual identification (VID) may fulfill the
requirements to employ ordnance. The ability to meet BVR ID criteria can
come from onboard systems, offboard systems or a combination of both.

NOTE: Most current theaters require both a positive enemy indication and a
lack of friendly indication to ensure the aircraft within a group is/are enemy
owned and operated.

Positive Enemy Indications
The following may or may not be used to satisfy a positive enemy indication.

e Point of origin (POO) — a group operating beyond a political
boundary, FEBA, FLOT or another specified enemy safe area
may be called a bandit. AWACS will also use the term
“OUTLAW” in this situation.

e NCTR —- an unambiguous return will be indicated with “PRINT
.” The fill-in may be called in the clear or called with
a code word.

e Mode X — a Mode X return will be indicated by the word “ECHO”
IAW AFTTP 3-1.

e AWACS/GCI may “DECLARE” a group hostile using
information such as POO, IFF, situational awareness, etc.
Declarations are normally used for aircraft lacking onboard
interrogation equipment (F-16).


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_42.jpeg:
Lack of Friendly Indication

In order to satisfy lack of friendly requirements, a completed check of
identification friend or foe (IFF)/selective identification feature (SIF) codes
must be accomplished. If using STT/PDT, processing must be completed, not
just initiated.

e “PAINTS” will be used (IAW AFTTP 3-1 “friendly IFF
interrogation return”) to mean a group does NOT meet “lack of
friendly” criteria; i.e., the group IS squawking one or more of the
required friendly modes/codes.

@ “SPADES” will be used IAW AFTTP 3-1 “lack of required
friendly IFF reply”) to mean a group DOES meet the “lack of
friendly” criteria; i.e., the group in question is NOT squawking
required modes 1, 2, 3C or 4, depending on SPINs.

Commit

Commit criteria is ROE dependent. The briefing usually includes commit
criteria (e.g., within 40 nm of CAP point or in the area of responsibility with
aspect 9 H-12 C). You can expect different commit criteria on each sortie.
Sometimes aspect, airspeed and range define the commit; other times the
location of the radar contacts defines it. Generally, fighters commit in order
to engage targets in a desired engagement zone (DEZ). The DEZ may be
defined by the particular AOR or by the flight lead. The bottom line in the
air is that the wingman can recommend, but lead has the hammer on the
commit. The briefed criteria are a guide, rather than a contract, for the flight
to commit.

Aborted Commit

If the fighters have committed, there are certain times to abort the commit
and return to the CAP. Reasons may include bandits dragging at long range
or outside the DEZ, bandits greatly outnumber the fighters, no PID, EA, etc.
Aborted commit should be included in the plan and understood by all players.

The mechanics for a commit should include a climb to maximize your WEZ
and ensure first launch opportunity (FLO) and acceleration to above the
mach (if able). Jettison the fuel tanks if ROE/squadron standards
dictate/allow, but remember that once you jettison them, they are gone for
good. Take fuel considerations into the jettison decision.

Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_43.jpeg:
Sanitize

Realize that the sample phase may occur several times during the search
phase. However, you need to ensure that all threats in your AOR have been
identified. This is the sanitization phase. A good rule of thumb is to make
sure you resanitize your AOR 5 nm prior to the meld. Remember to search
the extremes first.

Target

The targeting phase starts at the commit when the picture is being built. In
general, target groups and sort within groups. Fighter numbers and
ordnance, bandit numbers and ordnance, and the planned fighter tactic will
determine how the targeting will be accomplished. The targeting plan may
be for the fighters to target radar versus group (assigning a radar to each
factor group and multitargeting using TWS and AIM-120s) or radar versus
contact (assigning more than one radar to each group, sort within that group
and shoot each contact with AIM-7s/-120s). If the targeting plan is
well-briefed (and well-understood) the actual targeting should be obvious and
should not require directive comm from lead.

It is important to understand the concept of owning and sharing groups for
targeting to be effective. If you are targeting in accordance with the briefed
plan or have been directively targeted to a group, you own that group. This
means that you are the primary targeter and it is your responsibility to
kill/maintain SA on all contacts in that group. If your group subsequently
maneuvers and meets your return to search (RTS) criteria, you are still
responsible for the group until you ensure a positive handoff to another flight
member, AWACS or GCI. In general, flight leads and element leads will own
groups as the primary targeters. If a meld has been called on a group, then
other flight members designated to meld are sharing that group (secondary
targeters). When sharing, the secondary targeter will pick up the secondary
sort responsibility (i.e., as the wingman [far, respective side, AOR altitude]).

As an example of this concept, assume the fighters step with a primary plan
of radar versus group, multitargeting using TWS and AIM-120s. The initial
picture shows a single group with four contacts, but the fighters are only
loaded with three AIM-120s each. A single fighter cannot multitarget into
the group and account for all contacts. Lead may call, “EAGLE 2, MELD
BULL 360-50-21,000, FOUR CONTACTS, AZIMUTH.” With a single call
(meld), lead has just directed a change from radar versus group (each fighter
owning a group) to radar versus contact (both fighters sharing a group). Note
here, the fighters must still multitarget into the heavy group in order to
account for all contacts.


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_44.jpeg:
This brings up the roles of primary and secondary targeters. The primary
targeter is the fighter responsible for targeting a specific group. Specific
responsibilities are:

e Locking the group at the briefed range

e ID if required

e Multitargeting or calling the meld if sharing is required

e Communicating sort responsibilities if required

e Eyeball count

e Maintaining STT/PDT on respective side or highest threat

e Communicating bandit maneuvers

The secondary targeter is responsible for assisting the primary targeter.
Specific responsibilities include:

e Sanitizing and melding around primary targeter’s group (if
required)

@ Targeting spitters
@ Targeting pop-ups
e Sharing the group (if called in)

e Targeting the group when directed (shots trashed, heavy group,
etc.)

Realize that all these are prebriefed responsibilities. Lead always has the
hammer for directive targeting.

Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_45.jpeg:
Meld

Meld range depends on desired weapons employment range. AFTTP 3-1,
Volume 17, Chapter 15 discusses considerations for weapon employment
ranges. Minimal sort range should be 2-3 nm outside shot range, although
this may be increased due to ID requirements. In order to ensure all flight
members will see the threat picture, meld range must be an additional
5-10 nm outside sort range. Therefore, if you want to shoot NLT 20 nm, a
25 nm sort range and a 30 nm meld range might be appropriate.

The purpose of the meld is to see the picture—to find sort responsibility or
initiate targeting. When melding radars it is important to put your radar in
a position to (in decreasing priority) find your sort, see the entire picture and
bias altitude to your area of responsibility. Whether you own a group alone
(targeting) or are sharing a group (sorting), the mechanics of melding are the
same. The four basic mechanics are 60° sweep, MPRF, acq symbols leading
the group and set altitude coverage. At the meld call, acq symbols should be
initially placed at the briefed lock/sort range, then the altitude coverage set to
find your responsibility.

Initially, center your altitude coverage on the called altitude or on the last
known altitude of the group. As your proficiency increases, a good rule of
thumb is to bias your altitude coverage 5000' below/above the target, towards
your wingman’s AOR. For example, if you have the high search and the
target is at 18,000' put the bottom of your radar coverage to 13,000'. The
range to meld radars is weapons load, altitude and threat dependent.
Generally, meld in time to complete EID and sort for FLO/desired launch
range.

If planning to sort (share), the most important information is the group
altitude —“EAGLE 2, MELD, 25,000.”

Assume the group is within 30° of the nose and at the prebriefed meld range.
If this is not the case, then this information should be added to the meld call:
“EAGLE 2, MELD, 25,000, BRA 360-25.”

Additionally, the inner group picture should be called ASAP after the meld
call. If no picture is called, expect the wingmen to sort IAW the brief
according to the radar-apparent picture—“EAGLE 2, MELD 25,000,
SIDE-SIDE.”


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_46.jpeg:
The actions and comm, if clean after the meld, should also be briefed. In
general, if you are unable to see the picture on your scope after two full
sweeps, call “CLEAN.” The fighter with the picture should select TWS and
multitarget if able. If unable, the fighter with the picture should tell the
clean fighter where to look to find the sort. If both fighters are clean at the
meld, the flight lead should call a “de-meld.” This is a directive call to return
to search in your respective AOR. A common technique is to bring your acq
symbols 3-5 nm in front of the last known contact to set your coverage. This
will ensure adequate overlap in coverage at the closest possible range to the
lost contact.

Lock No Later Than (LNLT)/Sort

Lock range is established to ensure first launch opportunity (FLO) against an
adversary. If a valid sort can be accomplished, all players should lock/sort at
this predetermined range. If a valid sort cannot be accomplished, the
primary targeter (normally the flight lead/element lead) should lock to ensure
FLO. If owning the group alone, TWS should be selected after the initial shot
if more than one contact is known or expected.

The objective of sorting is to ensure all targets within a group are engaged to
achieve maximum kills premerge. A meld call should always precede a sort.
If no meld call is made, it is assumed the primary targeter is multitargeting
and the wingman will stay in search to sanitize for pop-ups/spitters. Radar
apparent geometry drives the sort, not necessarily the formation bandits are
flying. Possible radar-apparent formations are:

Side-Side (azimuth) — One side of acq symbols fits between returns
Near-Far* (range) — Distinct range breakout (generally = 2 nm)

High-Low (altitude) — May appear as one return but at two separate
altitudes

“Recall near-far is used for inner-group formation (sorting), while lead-trail is
used when labeling groups in range (picture building, targeting).

AAM-7 D - 40


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_47.jpeg:
The primary sort plan should be to match your formation. When sorting in
range, leads take the closest bandit, wingmen the farthest. When sorting in
azimuth, take the bandit that matches your position in the formation (your
side). If planned to be in a trail formation ( NAV FLIR trail), it should be
briefed how to handle a side-side sort. For example, inside-out is a method of
dealing with this. The lead sorts from the nose out, and the wingman sorts
from the side of the scope in. Multitargeting (more targets than missiles)
should be addressed as a contingency in the brief. It may be more useful to
brief a cardinal direction (i.e., lead sorts northern, and wingman sorts
southern).

If a valid sort is accomplished, call your sort with the appropriate label—
“EAGLE 2 SORTED FAR.” If unsure that a valid sort is achieved, call
“LOCKED” with the B/E and altitude. When locking and unsure of a valid
sort, the rule of 2s (altitude 2000', range 2 nm or heading 20°) is a good rule
of thumb to determine if you actually have a good sort. In that case, the call
sounds like: “EAGLE 2, LOCKED, B/E 230, 20, 20,000.”

The response should be one of two possible responses:

“EAGLE 1, SORTED NEAR, B/E 235, 25, 15,000” — lead just told you
that the flight is sorted and Eagle 2 is sorted far.

or

“EAGLE 1, LOCKED SAME, HEADING 180” — Eagle 1 has used the
rule of 2s, and the altitude and range of his contact were within two of
yours.

Now you must look at the heading of your bandit to see if there is greater
than 20° difference. If good (greater than 20°), call “EAGLE 2, HEADING
210, GOOD SORT.” If bad (within 20°), call “EAGLE 2 BAD SORT, BAD
SORT.”

Normally, the first to realize the bad sort will break lock and attempt to
achieve a valid sort. One caveat is if missiles are already in the air. In this
case, call “BAD SORT, FOX 3 THERE,” and flight lead will make the call on
who will break lock and sanitize to find the sort.


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_48.jpeg:
Remember that sorted does not mean locked. Nevertheless, once you are
sorted, you have a contract to monitor your responsibility and kill when in
position to do so. Sort on the shortest-range scope you can. This gives the
largest apparent breakout on the radar. When locking into a near-far
formation, bring the acq symbols in from the front of the formation to lock the
lead group, and from the back to lock the trailer. If locking into an azimuth
sort, come in from outside your man. This helps you lock the correct contact.
Also, try to lead your lock to allow the contact to “fly” into your mini-raster
because the radar shows history. Another technique is called spearing. This
is using the tip of the inside acq symbol to spear your sort contract

(Figure D-11). Generally, lock range is dependent on bandit altitude (WEZ).
A good rule of thumb for NLT lock range is 20 nm.

Shot

This is also mission, risk level, weapons load, altitude and threat dependent.
Weapons employment should be planned and briefed. Brief primary shooters,
noting the element leads are not required to be the primary shooters. In fact,
the scenario may drive wingmen as the primary shooters, while the element
leads hold missiles and keep their radars in RWS, waiting for the dust to
settle from the initial shots. This is a frequent F-15C employment tactic.

Regardless of your mission or loadout, missile management is always critical.
Your plan may call for a “shoot-look-shoot” (shoot, assess shot, shoot again if
necessary) or “shoot-shoot-look” (shoot two, assess shots) option. Typically,
attempt to shoot at DMC = 30-50. You can increase the DMC by centering
the dot; if on a CATA intercept, this will consist of a loft. A typical increase
with a loft is 10-30 DMC. The effectiveness is dependent on the altitudes of
both the shooter and the target. The goal is a single-shot kill. Monitor initial
shots and take follow-up shots out of a crank if necessary. After the initial
shot, crank at least 50-60° cold on the scope (on the fence works well). A
crank is a hard turn (4-5 Gs) as quickly as possible after the shot. You should
also descend and slow down (but maintain a tactical airspeed). You need to
watch bandit maneuvers while maintaining the crank so as not to gimbal.
Remember the difference between the HUD’s aspect stick and the radar
B-scope’s relative heading stick; do not confuse the two. During an
aggressive crank, a quick glance at the radar’s heading stick may make the
target appear to be maneuvering. Check the target’s displayed heading or
assess aspect changes via the HUD’s aspect stick. If the situation allows,
crank in the direction that supports your lead/wingman. The objective of the
crank is to decrease the bandit’s WEZ and maximize your F-pole. Remember
that you do not get the expanded F-pole if you are shooting out of TWS, so
plan to keep the TWS volume on the radar, and use no more than 4 Gs prior
to MPRF active.

STUDENT PREPARATION REQUIREMENTS

BEFORE CLASS

1. Study the information contained in the workbook and complete the
End of Text Quiz.

2. Read AFTTP 3-1, Volume 1, Attachment 1, the Operational Brevity
Words, Terminology, and Air-to-Air Communications Standards.


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_50.jpeg:
Crank Priorities

The following will give you a basic guideline to help you make the best
decision. Realize that it is you on the line and any decision is better than no
decision. Crank priorities are

1. Away from spikes. If you are spiked, you have to assume that
you are in or close to a WEZ. Crank in the closest direction to
put the spike on the beam.

2. Away from known factor threats. If other threats are or may be

a factor, crank away to isolate all the threats to one side.

3. With the briefed flow/mutual support. Large packages may
have a briefed flow; therefore, it would be in your best interest to
follow it and not be shot by a trigger-happy viper. Otherwise,
crank with your flight lead to maintain mutual support.

4. Against your bandit and away from his nose.

5. Toward green airspace. GCI or SA will be able to determine
this.

It is in your best interest to know the picture/threats when you take your
APG-70 from RWS to STT. Do not forget to communicate your actions so those

around you know what you are doing.

Decision Range

Decision range is the range at which you must decide to press the attack or go
out. The winning, losing, neutral decision is also made at this range. See
AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17, Chapter 15 for definitions and explanations.

Abort Range

Abort range is the last-chance range to go out and avoid a merge. See
AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17, Chapter 15 for definitions and explanations.

Shot Depth

Shot depth is how far into a threat display missiles will be shot. See

Split

This is guidance provided to the wingman. When the position/maneuvers of
the target pull the wingmen away from their formation position, they must
decide whether to leave formation or pass the target to GCI and maintain
formation. Split criteria are generally briefed as a target aspect at a given
range. This also applies to pop-up groups inside of meld range. A good rule
of thumb is to split if bogey/bandit aspect is greater than the range inside
FBR. It should be briefed whether split criteria is auto or must be requested.
Regardless, comm should be exchanged to increase all flight members’ SA.
The basic floating/split comm includes:

e Floating: Target has reached 45° and you must turn to
maintain radar SA.

e Split: At visual limits. Request to leave formation to prosecute
the attack.

e Crossing: Crossing lead’s 6 o’clock to maintain radar SA/STT.

Drop/Monitor

Maneuvering bandits can create confusion and a breakdown in your flight’s
formation integrity. You want to avoid having the target maneuvers scatter
your flight, lose all mutual support and have little or no SA about the overall
merge environment. Additionally, and probably more important, you do not
want to stay in STT on a bandit that is outside of a WEZ for an extended
amount of time and allow an untargeted bandit to arrive within a WEZ and
shoot. Generally, monitor or return to search (RTS) when outside of a WEZ
and:

e target beam aspect, outside of 15 nm

e target drag aspect, outside of 10 nm
Meeting RTS criteria does not mean “DROP.” You must always maintain SA
on your targeting/sort responsibility. Try to get a tally-ho or the targeting
pod on the group before returning to search. Also, select MPRF and 60°

sweep to maintain the highest chance of maintaining hits on the radar.

The “DROP” means that you have handed the responsibility for that group or
threat to another agency/flight (GCI, F-15C or other A/A assets).


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_52.jpeg:
ALL-ASPECT MISSILE DEFENSE (AAMD)

The key to properly defending is to always know your spike status, shot
status and range. It is also very important to know whether you were spiked
before or after your shot, especially when shooting AIM-7s. When offensively
engaging a threat BVR, you will use a decision and abort range based on the
threat. AFTTP 3-1 contains a good discussion of recommended decision/abort
ranges. These ranges will ensure you can defeat any front-quarter shots
kinematically and be outside of a rear-quarter WEZ after the maneuver. If
outside abort range, you have a choice to abort or notch. If inside abort
range, you are forced to notch. To decide if an abort is necessary you need to
decide if you are winning or losing. In short, if you are naked and supporting
a missile, you are winning. If you are spiked within the threat’s shot range
and have not shot, you are losing. If in a losing situation outside abort range
or if you do not feel you have good SA inside meld, prior to abort range, then
abort. To perform an abort, slice the aircraft 135° in AB to put the
bandit/bogey on your tail in minimum time while max performing the aircraft
(sliceback). If you find yourself in a losing situation inside abort range, make
a hard descending turn to the notch, dispense chaff, start looking for a tally
and thinking about IRMD. Asa rule, attempt to abort as a flight or element,
but notch as a singleton. Remember that the flight lead is the ultimate
authority. Ifthe flight lead calls an abort, it is directive; the wingman’s call
is descriptive.

Visual Arena

For most game plans, the goal is to shoot beyond visual range (BVR) and
remain BVR. However, some conditions/scenarios may require a merge. The
first thing to do is effectively pass the radar/visual responsibilities between
cockpits. Denying the bandit tally and acquiring tally is a huge advantage.
Also, going blind or stripped is a possibility in this phase. Do not keep
secrets—if you are “BLIND” call it. Call “STRIPPED” if outside briefed
formation and unable to tactically return.

AAM-7 D - 46


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_53.jpeg:
INFRARED MISSILE DEFENSE (IRMD)

Prior to the merge, IRMD becomes a player. Try to get as much speed as
possible prior to the 10 nm point. IRMD effectiveness depends on the threat
missile. In general, against less than fourth-generation heaters, the
following technique is good. At 10 nm start cooling down by getting out of AB
if the bandit is hot (> 16 AA). At 8 nm stand up your throttles, if able.
Around 5 nm, get the power back to idle and flare if you are spiked. If
performing AAMD, use 8 nm for out of AB, 5 nm stand up the throttles, and
3 nm power to idle and flares with a break into the bandit to deny IR missile
shots. Use timing to estimate 8, 5 and 3 nm, and a tally to determine when
to break into the bandit. Crew coordinate who will employ countermeasures.
This way both crew members will not put them out at the same time and
waste them.

Merge

At the merge, the possibility for ACM engaged/supporting roles exists. Use
proper comm (334 FS/DOW ACM comm handout) so there is a definite role
for each fighter. If multiple bandits are alive, clearing your flight path and
maintaining tally visual of all players is imperative. It is important to keep
the visual to avoid collisions into one another. A second consideration is the
flow to additional groups. Most likely the supporting fighter is monitoring
additional groups and will direct the flow to additional groups at the end of
the engagement.

Egress/Separation

Getting a quick separation is your number one priority when egressing a
fight. Air-to-air engagements and fireballs tend to draw a crowd and you
probably do not want to be there when more players arrive. The direction of
the separation is secondary. Ideally, you would like to separate toward a
friendly area, but that may not be feasible. So, head “the same way, same
day” and regroup. Always remember to change your altitude block when
able. Then turn back to the friendly area as a flight. Just in case the flight
separates, there needs to be a rendezvous plan. Also, consider your fuel and
ordnance state when egressing a fight. Have a short-range radar game plan.


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_54.jpeg:
SHORT-RANGE RADAR

Anytime you are clearing a merge or turning the flight to a direction that has
not been sanitized, employ short-range radar mechanics to clear your flight
path. Imagine building a bubble around your formation as you roll out on the
new heading. Always work from near to far. In general, use AUTO GUNS to
your side of the formation, biased into your AOR. Each sweep in AUTO
GUNS takes about 6 seconds. After one sweep in your AOR, bias the
coverage into the other AOR for one sweep. Always remember to look
visually into the AOR opposite of the AUTO GUNS search. After a frame in
each AOR (approximately 12 seconds), return to 20 nm scope, MPRF and
120° sweep. Place acquisition symbols at half scope (10 nm) and set the
prebriefed altitude coverage for a minimum of one full frame before returning
to long-range search. Remember that on a 20 nm scope you actually have
coverage out to 30 nm with the range limited cue capability of the APG-70.

Short-Range Commits

The actions in a short-range commit depend on range. Contacts outside meld
range will be handled IAW the briefed long-range plan. Remember that
groups outside meld will be prefaced with core information using DBE
information.

Inside of meld range, things need to happen fast because we do not have time
to build a picture and target. Inside of meld, call “POP-UP” with BRA.
Normally the flight lead will either target you there, or tell you to sanitize
because he is employing ordnance there. If you see more than one contact,
call a meld and sort appropriately (Figure D-12).

Inside FBR, the bandit is possibly in a WEZ and there is no time to meld and
sort. In this case, revert to ACM comm and roles. Call “ENGAGED” with
BRA (if acquired on the radar) or a clock position (if acquired visually). ID
and shoot ASAP! The flight lead will call you off using engaged comm if
necessary. Remember to check your spike status and react accordingly
(Figure D-12).

Figure D - 12.

Defensive Response

Similar to AAMD, the key is to be continuously aware of your spike status. If
against a correlated threat on the radar, the reaction will be basically the
same as the previous AAMD discussion. However, in a tactical environment,
you may be spiked from an unknown bandit. It is paramount to have a plan
to be able to survive. In general, uncorrelated far spikes (a spike from a
direction other than the bandits you see on your radar) can be reacted to

offensively. Turn to put a radar in the direction of the spike and use

short-range radar to find, ID and kill. Uncorrelated medium and near spikes
must be treated differently because the bandit may be in a WEZ. In general,
the spiked fighter will turn in the shortest direction to the notch and the
naked fighter will turn to the bearing of the spike, so use short-range radar

and visual lookout to find and kill.


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_56.jpeg:
CONTINGENCIES

The following is a list of different contingencies that may need to be

considered:

AAM-7

If there is a single contact or unsortable group, who locks and
shoots? That depends on what lead briefs, which is personal
preference, and depends on the experience level of each flight
member.

SKOSH/WINCHESTER: Automatic RTB or continue for radar
SA, ete.

Fighter fallout: Who will pick up primary talker, targeter and
shooter roles? How will the formation change?

GADGET BENT: Give the “tactical” lead to the good radar and
fly an offset intercept to the visual arena.

AAI/EID BENT: The good AAI has the hammer on bandit calls.

RWR/CMD/ICS BENT: For CMD, RWR and ICS problems,
leave it up to each crew to make a personal decision. One
technique is to have one good RWR in the element and assume
the same spike status.

Electronic attack (EA): In general, counter deception techniques
(“MUSIC”) with MPRF and counter noise techniques
(“STROBES”) with HPRF. In addition, switching radar
channels and offsetting the formation out of the jamming
pattern may be effective.

Return to search: Lastly, when does the flight return to search
and monitor a maneuvering bandit? That is threat dependent,
but typically use 10 nm for a dragger and 15 nm for a contact in
the beam.

High fast flyer (HFF): Define the HFF in the brief.
Engagement will likely include aggressive intercept geometry
and a climb to obtain near co-altitude and a hot (> 16 AA)
aspect. Missile choice is also a factor (AIM-7 versus AIM-120).

MISSION PLANNING

One of the most important aspects contributing to mission success is
premission planning. When planning for a mission, remember that there
is no single, best solution to any given tactical situation. The prudent
flight leader considers all available tactical options to develop a game plan
that accomplishes the mission objectives and is executable by the
least-experienced member of the flight.

Mission Planning Sources

Air Tasking Order (ATO)

The first source available for mission planning is the ATO. It is commonly
referred to as the frag and is written by the theater air component
commander. It directs the mission and the required assets. The mission
objectives drive all the subsequent planning and are balanced with force
survival to arrive at the combat plan. The frag also contains information
the individual flight leads will need to execute the mission. It will list the
call signs, ordnance, targets, TOTs, mission commander, package
elements, tanker information and any other support assets. Special
instructions (SPINs) and notes usually accompany it. Each mission will
be directed to the notes that will give additional information about the
mission or package. The SPINs and notes provide the coordination
instructions for composite force operations and include general
information that could explain the objectives or emphasize areas of
command concern. The SPINs are usually broken down into monthly,
weekly and daily SPINs. The monthly SPINs contain general information
or things that do not change; e.g., the overall engagement criteria, the
EID/PID criteria, the active tanker tracks, etc. The weekly SPINs contain
information that changes more rapidly; e.g., radio frequencies, code words,
changes to the monthly SPINs, etc. The daily SPINs have only those
things that change on a daily basis; e.g., IFF modes and codes, transition
levels or SAR codes. All of these documents should be checked to make
sure they all agree and do not hamper the mission. Changes to the ATO
or SPINs must be coordinated through the ATO production agency.


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_8.jpeg:
Airspace Control Order (ACO)/Airspace Control Plan (ACP)

The ACO is used to implement airspace control procedures. The aircrew
must be intimately familiar with this document to prevent degradation of
friendly air defense tactics or even worse, being shot down by friendly
forces. Key information listed in the ACO includes minimum risk routing
(MRR), missile engagement zones (MEZs), fighter engagement zones
(FEZs), kill zones, kill boxes, preset CAP points, AWACS orbits and
tanker tracks.

Intelligence

The intelligence section provides “big picture” data concerning the
air/ground/electronic order of battle. Intelligence also provides some
detailed information concerning enemy defenses, probable points of
encountering defenses, number of and type of systems, avionics capability
and tactics (observed and estimated). One approach to using intelligence
is to build a big picture, then develop the plan. Fine tune the plan with
detailed analysis of available intelligence data.

Weather

The weather shop estimates weather conditions for the area of operations.
Use this data to determine how weather may limit or enhance some of
your options. Consider tops and bottoms of cloud layers, visibility, contrail
level, solar azimuth and elevation, moon illumination, weather
restrictions at divert fields and how the weather may affect the support
assets. Weather condition estimates are likely to be less accurate the
further you operate from friendly territory.

AAM-7 D-2


Text from AAM-7_2_v_X_Intercepts_page_9.jpeg:
Mission Planning Considerations

With the “big picture” data, you are ready to plan the specifics for your
mission. The following list is not all-inclusive, but contains some
considerations for mission planning.

Weather

Cloud layers may force you higher or lower than the desired altitude.
Consider how much clear air above and below the cloud layers will be
optimum for visual lookout and threat reactions; the minimum altitude
may be spelled out for you in the ROKs. Contrails highlight you visually
but can be used to limit your radar search. In-flight visibility may force
the flight into tighter visual formations (reducing 6 o’clock coverage) or
may force a detached mutual support formation (radar trail), limiting the
wingman’s radar lookout. Sun angle may determine an offset direction
and final attack geometry. TDA/IR visibility may also influence the
attack profile or direction. If at night, moon illumination and elevation
need to be considered. Winds, at altitude and for the weapon time of fall,
must be considered when planning the mission; severe crosswinds or
head/tailwinds may be a determining factor for target attacks and fuel
planning. Finally, weather is a factor in determining fuel requirements
for diverts, or which diverts are even available.

Terrain

Selection of ingress and egress altitudes involves a number of trade-offs.
Consider the mission objective, threat capability, crew workload and radar
detection as the primary issues when determining penetration altitudes.
Terrain masking may offer good concealment but may limit your own
radar detection and weapons capabilities. Low altitude may severely
affect friendly GCI capability. MSL versus AGL must be considered for
threat assessment, ejection altitudes, RWR considerations and weapons
effects. Do not forget to determine radar blind zones and possible ambush
CAP locations for your own formation’s radar game plan.

Lead Turn

The lead turn (Figure D-1) is your primary tool in high aspect BFM. A
lead turn is simply an attempt to decrease angle-off prior to passing the
opponent’s 3/9 line (turning prior to 3/9 passage). It can be done in any
plane (horizontal, vertical, or a combination). If you can out turn the
bandit because of your superior aircraft or more favorable airspeed
conditions, maneuver for lateral separation early. Do not expect
spectacular results after the first lead turn since a sequence of such
maneuvers is usually required to achieve a position in a weapons
envelope. You are just trying to gain a position of offensive advantage so
you can use your offensive maneuvers to slide into a weapons envelope,
and shoot something at the bandit. The lead turn is not a one time only
maneuver. It is available at every merge and should be considered every
time there is a high aspect pass. It requires patience, for rarely will you
gain the offensive after one lead turn. If you continually gain angles at
every merge, you should eventually reach a point where you can drive the
fight for a kill. The bandit can deny you a lead turn by turning into you
(i.e., attempting to lead turn you). The result of both aircraft lead turning
is a close aboard high aspect pass.

AAM-8 D-4


Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_11.jpeg:
The goal of a lead turn is to reduce angle off prior to a 3/9 line passage. In
a perfectly executed lead turn, you would roll out in the bandit's six o'clock
area in the control zone, as in Figure D-1. This perfect lead turn occurs
when you have the correct amount of offset (horizontal and vertical), start
the lead turn at the right time, use the proper amount of G, and the
bandit allows you to do it.

The first task is to build the required amount of offset. This can be done
at the terminal stages of an intercept or visually after a long range tally-
ho. It is always preferable to gain turning room in both the horizontal and
vertical. This way, a single move by an unaware attacker will not take
away all your turning room. As a general rule of thumb you need 4000 to
7000 feet of turning room. Visually this can be established by placing a
high aspect bandit outside the canopy bow high (level with the upper
mirrors) or low (inside the crotch of the canopy bow) as in Figure D-2. If
after placing the bandit here you see a turn into you, the bandit is lead
turning you.

You should bring the bandit back to the nose and expect a high aspect
merge.

AAM-08-02

Figure D - 2.


Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_12.jpeg:
Since pure horizontal or vertical conversions may not be tactically sound,
it may be best to use a combination. While establishing horizontal
turning room, it is your option either to get vertical turning room above or
below. Going above gives you the advantages of radial G, a smaller turn
radius (hence less required offset), easier ability to maintain your energy
state, and an easier to judge entry (because you are closer). The
disadvantages are that you are providing the bandit a lookup radar shot
and your IR missiles may be looking into a hot clutter environment.
Going below gives you the advantages of radar ground clutter, the
possibility to highlight the bandit against the sky/clouds, and it is easier
to keep sight of the bandit. The disadvantages are that you need to have
more airspeed which leads to a larger turn radius (more offset required),
more G on the conversion (more of a chance to over-G), and a harder entry
to judge. Of course, environmental considerations such as clouds or sun
levels may drive you to one or the other.

The time to start a lead turn is when you notice an increase in the bandit's
line-of-sight. When you initially offset the bandit on the outside of the
canopy bow, the bandit will appear to be stationary. As the range closes
and the offset builds, the bandit will start to move on your canopy. When
this movement starts to increase “dramatically”, it is time to initiate the
lead turn.

AAM-8 D-6


Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_13.jpeg:
To perform a lead turn: unload, rotate your lift vector in front (lead) of the
bandit, and initiate your pull. Generally the pull needs to be at least 5-6
Gs, but could be more or less. A low to high lead turn requires more G, a
high to low less G. Remember, the goal is to lead turn into an unaware
bandit's control zone (i.e., approximately 3000 feet in the stern). As you
begin the lead turn the bandit will be in the vicinity of your canopy bow.
As you continue your pull the bandit will start to track toward the HUD
for about the first third to half of the turn and then gradually start
drifting up and away from the HUD. If the bandit stays stationary on the
canopy after the first part of the turn, you are on a collision course and
will collide if nothing changes. If this happens you will need to
momentarily ease off your pull (lag) to allow a line-of-sight rate to develop,
then get back onto the pull. If after the first part of the turn the bandit
continues to track through the HUD and toward the nose, you are turning
in front of the bandit (you started your lead turn too early). This is called
a “no respect” lead turn. If you take no action, and the bandit recognizes
your error, you may be defensive very shortly as in Figure D-3. Again,
you will need to momentarily ease off your pull (lag) to allow a line-of-
sight rate to develop, then get back onto the pull.

Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_14.jpeg:
In summary, the lead turn is the most efficient way to win from a neutral
pass. The only time you would not want to lead turn is when you want to
bugout from the merge or want to separate for energy and then comeback
and fight. In this case, you want to stay in pure pursuit as long as
possible to create the highest HCA for the most effective separation.

Common Errors in Performing Lead Turns

e Recognizing LOS rate late or not using available turning room-
allows bandit to lead turn you, angle off is not reduced at merge.

e Lead turning before LOS becomes apparent-may put you in front of
bandit. Adjust lift vector on bandit's six and pull to pass close aboard
(turning room permitting) but always behind the bandit.

e Not lead turning after the first merge-lead turns are authorized more
than once per engagement. Do not accept continuous high aspect

passes, continue to lead turn until the bandit is dead.

e Not prepared for the merge-lean forward in seat so that you can look
past the seat and maintain the tally.

e Pure pursuit too long trying to get an auto acquisition lock on-
therefore, no turning room is achieved.

e Forgetting the separation option and ending up anchored or
defensive.

AAM-8 D-8


Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_15.jpeg:
HIGH ASPECT BFM
Initial Moves

Assuming bugging out is not your plan, you are left with three options at
the pass.

e Blow-through-extend and comeback

e Hard turn at the pass (horizontal or oblique)
@ Go vertical

Extend and Comeback

As you merge, monitor the bandit’s direction of turn, maintain tally and
perform a separation maneuver in full AB. This option is good if your
energy is low, if entering with limited SA, or if merging with a better
turning aircraft. It also gives you turning room for a front aspect AIM-9
or AIM-120 shot. However, it is easy to lose tally during the extension,
due to rapidly increasing range, and also during the high G turn back into
the fight. More importantly, you give up your initial positional advantage
and it is dangerous against an all aspect threat. The bandit may be using
your time in extension to get turned around for a shot.

Hard Turn at the Pass

This is not a bad first move when you know the bandit can turn well but
you do not know the bandit’s energy state. It is easier to keep tally and at
corner velocity, the F-15E may have a turn rate advantage over most
bandits. Also, if the bandit elects to separate, this is the quickest way to
achieve weapons parameters and shoot him. On the other hand, it tends
to anchor the fight and requires high energy. If done incorrectly, you can
deplete all of your energy and quickly become defensive or at least
anchored.


Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_16.jpeg:
Vertical Fight

The vertical fight usually results in an energy management fight which is
not a bad move against an energy/thrust deficient bandit. Initially you
want to use the pure vertical. Do not go oblique. Get the AB in early and
use max rate over the top. Since this kind of fight is unpredictable, you
may cause the bandit to lose sight. It allows you to exploit your potential
energy and use radial G. However, it is hard to keep tally and may give
the bandit a blue sky background for the shot.

Now that you have made your first move, each of these three maneuver
options can turn into a one-circle or two-circle fight. A one versus two-
circle fight is not simply your decision, but a combination of both yours
and the your bandit's strategies. The decision for a one or two-circle fight
will be made by the aircraft that turns last.

If you have made a significant lead turn, you are usually committed to
continuing your turn in that direction. To reverse your turn to force a
certain type of fight will mean throwing away the angles that you have
already built in the lead turn which equates to the bandit having that
many angles worth of advantage at the merge.

Two-Circle and One-Circle Fights

Two-Circle Fight

A two-circle fight (Figure D-4) occurs when you fly across each others
extended six flight path. The second merge normally occurs after
approximately 270° of turn. The two-circle fight gives you the opportunity
to fight an intimidation fight (max turn and point at the bandit at longer
ranges) or an energy fight (sustained turn, conserve energy, and watch).
It allows you to use your better turn rate/radius, allows use of all aspect
weaponry and HOTAS, and if things are not going well, it provides a
better separation opportunity. The two-circle fight offers you a chance for
an AIM-9, AIM-7, or AIM-120 shot, but it is the long way around thus
requiring much more distance/time to kill the bandit. Also, do not forget it
gives the bandit the same options and maintaining a tally may be more
difficult against a smaller aircraft.

Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_18.jpeg:
The two-circle fight may be used for some of the following reasons:
Performance of Aircraft

The bandit is a better turning aircraft.

Airspeed

Your airspeed is much higher than the bandit’s thus drastically increasing
your turn radius versus the bandit’s.

Energy

A two-circle fight tends to be a much faster fight than a one-circle fight
allowing greater separation potential.

Weapons

Provides you more room for all-aspect weapons employment and better
HOTAS capability.

Unknown Bandit

Allows you time to evaluate the bandit’s aircraft and flying skill and offers
better opportunity for separation.

AAM-8 D-12


Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_19.jpeg:
One-Circle Fight

Both aircraft turn the same way (Figure D-5). It is clearly the shortest
route to a min time kill opportunity. Additionally, it jams the bandit’s
long range ordnance and is good against a turn deficient bandit. There
are some disadvantages though. You are giving up turning room. The
fight will probably beat your energy down and your all-aspect missiles will
also be jammed. This type of fight is usually only attempted when you
enjoy a significant turn advantage over your adversary.

—

AAM-08-05

Figure D - 5. One-Circle Fight.

Some considerations for a one-circle fight are:
Performance of Aircraft

Your turn radius is smaller than the bandit’s. Example: F-15E versus F-4
type aircraft.

Airspeed

The bandit’s airspeed is much greater than yours (rate/radius).

Handling Characteristics

Your aircraft's slow-speed handling is much better than the bandit’s.
One-circle fights can end up in a scissors.

Tactical Surprise

Many times the bandit may be surprised by this move and make a
mistake giving you an advantage.

A one-circle fight normally is not a sustained energy fight, it is a nose
position fight. So, once committed, you must get your nose to the bandit
quickly and force the fight by aggressive lead turns.

High Aspect BFM Considerations

High Speed/Poor Turning Bandit

When fighting a bandit that has excellent thrust but poor turn capability,
you must intimidate the bandit and force a defensive turn that will
deplete energy. Above corner airspeed, your jets are the same; but once
you are both below corner, you have the advantage.

Here you want to go for a one-circle fight. You want to get inside the
bandit’s turn circle ASAP, without bleeding off all of your airspeed. You
may have exclusive use of the vertical against this type of bandit; use it to
help you get inside the larger turn circle. Hit the merge with 450 knots
and slow to corner where you can out-rate the bandit in the turn. Use lag
as required but keep the pressure on to keep the bandit turning and losing
energy. You can expect the bandit to extend whenever possible to try to
keep the fight fast and at some point, take the fight up and give you a
chance to make a mistake and get too slow.

Take FOX 1s, 2s and 3s and force defensive maneuvers that deplete
energy. Keep your nose in control of the horizon. At the top of the egg
below 350 knots you can use horizontal turning room because the bandit
cannot exploit the room above you. Take a small bite with a vertical lead
turn on each pass but do not get greedy.

AAM-8 D-14


Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_21.jpeg:
Common errors are pulling too late to use the lead turn available resulting
in no appreciable gain, not forcing the bandit to slow below 420 knots and
exploiting your turn rate advantage, or depleting all your energy and
ending up slow and in the middle of the bandit’s turn circle with no shot
opportunity.

Slow Speed/Good Turning Bandit

Since this bandit is probably thrust limited, AB allows you to better
sustain your turns and energy and to exploit the vertical. The bandit, on
the other hand, will probably be able to generate max angles at slow
speeds and would like to get you in a knife fight. Therefore, keep your
energy high enough to sustain it during turns while driving the bandit’s
energy down to a point that gives you a total sanctuary in the vertical. A
game plan might be to force a two-circle fight. Get the bandit to bleed off
energy early and go for a level or low to high lead turning pass. Now with
an energy and airspeed advantage, take the fight vertical using an
optimum pull. Climb well above the bandit and put your lift vector in lead
(vertical). You can expect the bandit to try to force you to make an energy
mistake. The key is the 2nd and 3rd merge. If the bandit lead turns low,
go high to counter it. If you both take it up, use AB and airspeed to build
exclusive vertical turning room. Use 5-6 Gs and not 7-8 Gs in the pull.
The bandit will probably be able to go over the top once or twice and then
no longer. Once you are above the bandit, go for the control position. Use
your lift vector and slowly work toward guns. Remember if you decide to
go for a snapshot, have over-the-top airspeed otherwise, the bandit may
try to arc your oblique turn.

The most common errors in this type fight are not keeping continuous
pressure on the bandit and allowing a slow bandit to intimidate you with
nose position and become energy equal to you. Also, another error is using
max turns instead of sustained turns thereby depleting your own energy
and denying yourself the vertical.

Good Turn Rate and Radius Bandit

This is a very tough opponent to fight. If you end up in a fight with this
type of bandit, you would like to exploit the HOTAS and all-aspect missile
capability of the F-15E. Remember though, this bandit may have very
good capabilities as well (including the AA-11s off-boresight capability).

For this type of bandit, you want to make the kill as quickly as possible.

Give the bandit a secondary BFM problem by putting ordnance in the air
as soon as possible. Try to take the fight two-circle to allow you to use

D-15 AAM-8


Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_22.jpeg:
your all-aspect capability. Use whatever auto acq mode will give you the
fastest lock, but remember no-lock AIM-120s (if you are sure there are no
friendlies near or you can ensure shot deconfliction) or boresight AIM-9s if
anything delays your radar lock. You must respect the bandit’s nose, so
maneuver as appropriate and remember to employ chaff and/or flares as
appropriate. Sustain or regain energy when possible and strive to gain a
lead turn advantage on subsequent merges. If you are not gaining or
seem to be losing advantage on each pass, look for opportunities to
separate. Knowing your enemy and their ordnance capabilities can save
your life in this situation.

Common errors are not flying your best 1v1 BFM and missing shot
opportunities. Proper energy management is crucial against this type of
bandit. Do not allow the bandit to win the rate fight as a result of your
mistakes.

CONCLUSION

The important fact to be remembered is that regardless of the degree of
maneuvering affordable, once engaged you must employ your best 1v1
BFM until the kill is achieved or the situation dictates or permits a
separation. To be well versed across the entire spectrum of BFM, you
must be exposed to all elements, high speed and low speed, offensive and
defensive, during your training. This is the only way to ensure that when
the time arises, you will have the skills necessary to employ your jet
effectively and efficiently in combat.

INTRODUCTION

An understanding of the concepts and maneuvers related to high aspect
BFM (HABFM) is a crucial step in your training in the Strike Eagle. You
must understand how to perform a lead turn before attempting the two-
ship maneuvers you will be expected to perform during ACM to defeat a
bandit. More importantly, this is a realistic way to start an air-to-air
engagement since the normal entry to a fight in the “real world” starts
with an intercept leading to a high aspect merge with an adversary.
HABFM may also be necessary for short range engagements with
previously undetected bandits.

You must understand the basic concepts of offensive BFM and defensive
BFM and apply them to succeed in turning a high aspect pass into a fight
where you have a position of advantage. In high aspect BFM, you will
learn to maneuver to an offensive advantage from a high aspect setup,
and learn when and how to separate from the fight if the situation
deteriorates.

BFM MECHANICS AND DEFINITIONS

High aspect BFM objectives are similar to offensive BFM: maneuver to a
WEZ and kill the bandit, maneuver to an offensive position, or separate
before becoming defensive.

As you learned from OBFM and DBFM, good energy management is
crucial for you to gain and maintain an advantage during any BFM
situation. Energy includes not only the kinetic energy you gain by
pushing up your throttles, but also the potential energy you gain by using
the vertical to your advantage.

Capability to use vertical turning room on the initial maneuver to achieve
offensive advantage is a concept new to you at this point. While you
probably want to start a fight very near to corner velocity for OBFM and
DBFM, it may be necessary to be above corner velocity at the start of a
high aspect BFM engagement. This is especially true if making a low-to-
high lead turn on a bandit since you will lose energy during the uphill
turn. You must monitor your speed, G available, and maneuvering
capability to maximize your ability to exploit turning room.

AAM-8


Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_8.jpeg:
When you meet another bandit head-on in a visual engagement, you have
three basic options or combinations of options.

e FOX-1, FOX-2, or FOX-3 from front, then:

° Blow-through to bugout
° Separate for energy then re-engage, or
° Turn to engage

You may elect any of these options initially depending upon conditions, or
may elect to employ a sequence of these options. If the ROE, your
remaining ordnance, and your weapons system's status permit, your first
move will probably be to shoot a FOX-1, FOX-2, or FOX-3 from the front
quadrant. Use your auto-acquisition modes to acquire the radar lock-on
(if you do not have one already), satisfy the parameters for the weapon
selected, and shoot. You can also employ the AIM-9M or the AIM-120
visually without a lock. Remember deconfliction criteria especially when
launching without a lock. If you can launch the first missile, the situation
is now 2v1 in your favor. Even if your missile is defeated, the bandit’s
energy state should be significantly lower and you have improved your
odds for successfully employing one of your other options. If the bandit
launches the first missile, you will have to react defensively to defeat that
missile before you can continue the engagement. You may, however, have
an opportunity to launch your own missile as you initiate your defensive
reaction.

During the early stages of the 1v1 engagement, you have an excellent
chance to bugout from the fight if conditions such as fuel, weapons,
aircraft problems, or other bandits in the neighborhood make this your
most intelligent option. You will have high heading crossing angles so you
can accelerate, blow-through the merge and depart the fight using a
separation maneuver. If your bandit does not see you, try to deny a tally
by maintaining as close to pure pursuit as possible until you merge. If the
bandit sees you and starts to turn toward you, take a pure pursuit type
course to minimize turning room and consider a very high angle gun
attack (turning room permitting) as you merge. Remember, the bandit
may try to use the gun against you also.

The option to engage in a turning fight is your third (and probably least
desired) alternative. If conditions are favorable and/or your mission
requires you to eliminate the bandit, you should lead turn and pick your
entry for a one/two-circle fight.

AAM-8 D-2


Text from AAM-8_High_BFM_page_9.jpeg:
Turning Room

Turning room is displacement from an adversary’s flight path plane that
allows you to execute a turn to roll out at six o’clock. In a perfect world,
the bandit would never see you and allow you to pick the amount of
turning room you need to execute a lead turn and roll out directly at six
o’clock. While your bandit may be generous enough to allow you to do this
during a lead turn exercise in training, you probably will not be lucky
enough for this to happen in a tactical situation unless the bandit is no-joy
with no situation awareness (SA).

The amount of turning room you will be able to acquire and use will vary,
but if you desire to do a well-timed 180° lead turn to roll out at a bandit’s
six o’clock, you would need one turn diameter (yours, not the bandit’s).
Remember the turn diameter will vary based on your TAS and G. Using
the vertical also affects the size of the turn diameter as you work with
(going downhill) or against (going uphill) God’s G. Tactical decisions that
may affect your choice of turning room above, below, or in the same
horizontal plane are addressed in MCM 3-1.

A key point to remember is that turning room available to you is also
available to the bandit. If the bandit sees you and chooses to start and
lead turn on you, it will affect your game plan.

Deconfliction

The most important concept when discussing roles/responsibilities is that
of deconfliction. The support fighter owns the deconfliction hammer at all
times until a proper role exchange occurs. Realize the bandit determines
who the engaged fighter should be and may necessitate the need for a role
swap. The control zone is an inherently dangerous region since offensive
BFM drives attacking fighters into this small airspace. Therefore, it is
imperative that support fighters ensure the engaged fighter is not a factor
before entering the control zone. As the support fighter, you should avoid
all actions that will hamper the engaged fighter’s ability to fulfill the
primary responsibility of killing the bandit. This does not preclude the
support fighter from employing all-aspect weapons against the bandit as
soon as shot deconfliction (discussed later) requirements have been met.

Role Establishment

Engaged

By default, the flight lead is the engaged fighter until clearing the
wingman to engage. The most effective elements are those in which there
is a fairly fluid exchange of roles in response to the bandit’s maneuvering
decisions. Roles are established by an “KNGAGED?” call by one fighter or
the other. The hierarchy to determine who should be calling “ENGAGED”
is most defensive fighter, most offensive fighter, then flight lead. The
initial “ENGAGED?” call requires a response from the other aircraft for the
role establishment to occur. The best way to respond would be

“EAGLE 2,” which would imply that you were tally the bandit and picking
up the support fighter role. Some flight leads may want to hear

“EAGLE 2, TALLY” as a response. As the engaged fighter, you are either
defensive or offensive as discussed in the following paragraphs.

Defensive

The defensive role is whom the bandit is actively attacking. This can
begin in the BVR or visual arena. Ifa fighter is reacting defensively, that
fighter should be the engaged fighter. If a role swap is required, it will not
be accomplished until a positive handoff through radio communications is
achieved. For example, “EAGLE 1, DEFENSIVE, BANDIT MY SIX, 6000
FT,” would require a response of “EAGLE 2” to establish roles. In general,
“DEFENSIVE” is equivalent to an “ENGAGED?” call, which sets up the
proper engaged/support fighter roles.

AAM-9 D-4


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_11.jpeg:
Offensive

If the bandit is unaware, then the fighter with the most offensive entry
should call “ENGAGED.” If the bandit is reacting to a fighter, then that
fighter should call “ENGAGED.” For example, “EAGLE 1, TALLY 1, BRA
020/55, 5000, ENGAGED.” As a wingman, you should always strive to be
the engaged fighter; it is your chance to be aggressive. The flight lead will
reign you in if required.

Flight Lead

If everything previously discussed is equal and no one has yet called
“ENGAGED,” then the flight lead is engaged. Once the bandit reacts, it
should become clear who should subsequently call “ENGAGED” in
relation to the above-mentioned criteria.

Support

Any fighter who is not an engaged fighter automatically assumes a
support role. A support fighter maintains this role until it is absolutely
clear to all involved fighters via communication that the support fighter
has incurred the engaged role, including by going defensive.

Role Exchange
Once roles have been established, they do not switch without confirmation
from the engaged fighter. There must be a simple rule that applies to all

situations to determine when the roles need to swap.

Engaged Fighter is Offensive/Neutral

It is important to remember that the support fighter does not need to be
the engaged fighter to employ ordnance, as long as the flight path and
weapons deconfliction can be maintained. If the engaged fighter is
neutral/stagnated in an offensive position and the support fighter has a
better entry into the control zone, then the support fighter should call
“ENGAGED” to request the role exchange. The support fighter will
maintain deconfliction until the role swap has occurred through
communication. The support fighter should call “ENGAGED” prior to
maneuvering the jet into a position where a potential flight path conflict
might exist. In addition, the support fighter should not call “ENGAGED”
too early, thereby reducing pressure on the bandit. The timing of the
“ENGAGED” call is critical.


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_12.jpeg:
Support Fighter Becomes Defensive

The roles should swap when the support fighter becomes defensive and
can no longer perform support fighter responsibilities. This will require
communication for the swap to be complete. It should be noted, however,
that the roles do not have to swap as long as the support fighter can
maintain the support fighter’s responsibilities. For example, if Eagle 1 is
out of the fight looking for a reentry and the bandit’s nose passes through
Eagle 1 (the support fighter), but the bandit does not continue to
prosecute an attack on Eagle 1, then Eagle 1 would not call “ENGAGED.”
The most efficient ACM occurs when there is harmony between who the
bandit has chosen to engage and the roles established through F-15E
communication.

Engaged Communication

Once a fighter calls “ENGAGED” according to the criteria, the following
comm terms will be among the possible responses available to both
aircrews:

e PRESS — A directive call to the flight member who just called
“ENGAGED” to continue the attack. The individual saying
the word “PRESS” is now accepting the support role and will
ensure deconfliction. Roles are swapped.

e UNABLE -— This response indicates the engaged fighter is
unable to disengage/pick up the support role without
jeopardizing continued survival, or the need to attack an
additional bandit entering the fight will not allow the
engaged fighter to pick up the support role. Roles are not

swapped.

The flight lead has an additional response available:

e NEGATIVE - This simply means “no.” The flight lead, based
on inherent authority, is unwilling to disengage/flow in the
manner requested. The wingman must maintain the support
role. Roles are not swapped.

AAM-9 D-6


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_13.jpeg:
Flow, Roles Exchanged

Once the engaged fighter responds in the affirmative (i.e., “PRESS”) to a
role exchange request, the roles are exchanged. However, even if the
“PRESS” call is received, prudence dictates that the newly engaged fighter
should exercise caution as the support fighter (or any other involved
aircraft) deconflicts. The engaged fighter must continue to clear its own
flight path and remain predictable.

Flow, No Exchange of Roles

If the engaged fighter is blind or unable to exit the fight without being
shot, the engaged fighter should call “UNABLE.” If the engaged fighter
has denied a role exchange, the support fighter must flow to deconflict
with the fight and continue in the support role. However, this does not
preclude the support fighter from shooting if a clear field of fire becomes
available (and flight path deconfliction is assured). The only way for a
wingman to deny a role exchange is through an “UNABLE” call. The
flight lead may use “NEGATIVE” for several reasons. For example, if the
support fighter is not in a good position when calling “ENGAGED.”

Special Case Engage/Support Communication
Break Turns

A great deal of confusion can occur when a bandit arrives in a position
that forces the element to execute a break turn. If a break turn is called,
the F-15E on the inside of the turn will be the engaged fighter until it
becomes obvious (bandit’s pursuit course or F-15E RWR) who the bandit is
attacking. The fighter on the outside of the turn will have the easiest
time maintaining flight path deconfliction while still executing smart
BFM. Whoever called the break turn should be talking the other fighter’s
eyes onto the bandit until “TALLY” is called.

Bandit Switches

The bandit could elect to switch the attack to another F-15E at anytime.
The primary indicators of a switch are bandit nose position (consider
bandit radar/heat nose and HMS capabilities, as applicable) and F-15E
spike status. The first fighter to realize the switch should use directive
communication as required to initiate the appropriate defensive response
and add any necessary descriptive commentary. The responses are as
described earlier. For example, “EAGLE 4, BANDIT SWITCHED,
ENGAGED.” As a technique, the flight lead may brief that a “BANDIT
SWITCHED” call with an acknowledgement from the other fighter
completes a role exchange. This technique helps to minimize
communication.

D-7 AAM-9


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_14.jpeg:
ACM COMMUNICATIONS

Effective communication is essential to maximize the element’s potential.
A key factor in role establishment and coordinated employment is
communication of critical information during the engagement. This is
where the roles and responsibilities are confirmed so there is no doubt as
to who the engaged fighter is and who the support fighter is. Aircrews
must use standard terminology in order to avoid confusion, enhance SA
and minimize excessive radio transmission time. Standard transmissions
using brevity code result in a lot of information passed in relatively few
words. On the other hand, if standard terminology does not fit the
situation, clearly and concisely state what needs to be said. Nonstandard
radio terminology (RT), lack of call signs and excessive communication can
cause confusion and misunderstanding at a critical time. Communication
discipline is necessary. No one else on the tactical frequency needs to hear
this intraflight communication; the intensity of the communication
required may totally saturate whatever frequency is being used.
Therefore, use the auxiliary radio to the maximum extent possible for
ACM communication.

Format

The format depends on whether the element is starting out offensive or
defensive. There are four categories of communication words that apply to
ACM: directive, descriptive, informative and engaged/support
communication. This discussion is presented in terms of an engaged
element. However, it applies with any number of involved F-15Ks.

AAM-9 D-8


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_15.jpeg:
Communication Categories

Directive Commentary

Directive commentary tells the other fighter in the element to do
something. The first priority is to get the element maneuvering in
minimum time to defeat any potential bandit attack and establish roles.
Tell the element what to do by using the call sign of the fighter you are
talking to and then filling in important additional information with
descriptive commentary. For example, if the F-15E wingman (Eagle 2)
visually detects a bandit approaching weapons parameters from the flight
lead’s right side, the call “EAGLE 1, BREAK RIGHT!” should be made.
Eagle 1 now has the engaged role (the defensive fighter), while Eagle 2 is
the support fighter. Eagle 2, currently with the highest SA on the bandit,
attempts to kill the bandit while deconflicting with Eagle 1, who may be
blind and no joy during the defensive break. Examples of directive calls
are:

@ BREAK (with direction)  ) CHECK
e HARD (with direction) ® COME BACK
e FLARE e COME OFF

@ SEPARATE (with direction) e CONTINUE

e JINK e DEPLOY

e BLOW THROUGH e HOOK

e BRACKET @ PUSH IT UP

e BUGOUT ® REFERENCE (with
direction)

An important point to remember is that when a wingman uses a directive
term/word, it is a request and the flight lead reserves the right to
approve/deny the wingman’s requested action. When the flight lead uses
a directive term, it is just that—lead has the hammer!

Descriptive Commentary

Descriptive commentary consists of telling the other fighters where to look
or what is happening. Descriptive calls can also be used to ask questions.
After initiating a reaction with directive communication, fill in with
descriptive commentary, as required, to coordinate between involved
fighters. Descriptive commentary should include call sign and one or
more of the following items as the situation requires:

e Type of aircraft or threat identification (bandit/bogey)
e Left or right (side of aircraft)

e Clock position

e High/level/low

e Range

For example, “EAGLE 1, BANDIT RIGHT 3 O’CLOCK, 2 MILES, LOW.”
Other example descriptive terms include:

e BANDIT e NO JOY

e BLIND e OFF

e BOGEY e POSIT

e BUDDY LOCK e RAYGUN

e FOX e SLOW

e GREEN e STATUS

e KILL e SWITCHED
e LOCKED e TALLY

e LOW e TRASHED

Informative/Situational Awareness Building Communication

Informative communication is used to build situational awareness.

Examples include:

OFFENSIVE/DEFENSIVE

ANCHORED

IN

OUT

SWITCHED

SPIKE

SPLIT

CHECK GAS

Informative calls use the call sign of the aircraft talking.

Plain English

While communication discipline is of the utmost importance in the air
combat arena, killing the bandit in minimum time while ensuring F-15E
deconfliction is paramount. If at a loss for what to say, revert to plain

English to convey intentions to the other fighter.

Engaged Communication Format

When engaging from a radar contact or during longer-range tally-ho’s use

BRA format. For example, “EAGLE 1, TALLY 1, BRA 020/5, 5000,

ENGAGED.” When closer, communication may degrade to clock position
and relative altitude such as “EAGLE 1, TALLY 1, RIGHT 1 O'CLOCK,
LOW, ENGAGED.”

AAM-9


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_18.jpeg:
Merge Communication

At the merge, there are four brevity terms to indicate the flight’s status:

ANCHORED - Call “ANCHORED?” if anticipating turning
more than 90° to shoot a bandit.

DEFENSIVE — A bandit is forcing the aircraft to react for
survival. The defensive fighter should be the engaged
fighter, thus not responsible for deconfliction. It implies soon
to be anchored.

ENGAGED — The caller is maneuvering with intent to kill
the bandit. In addition, using this term begins the process of
establishing ACM roles.

BREAK - This call is a directive to perform an immediate
maximum performance turn in the indicated direction. It
assumes a defensive situation.

Brevity Definitions

AAM-9

OUT (with direction) — Informative call indicating a turn to a
cold aspect relative to the threat. In the ACM environment,
this call is optional. The support fighter normally uses this
call after a role exchange when leaving the fight to regain
energy.

IN (with direction) — Informative call indicating a turn to a
hot aspect relative to the threat. In the ACM environment,
this call is optional. The support fighter normally uses it
after regaining energy and starting the turn back toward the
fight.

STATUS — Request for an individual’s tactical situation. In
the ACM environment, this call is used to confirm which
aircraft is the bandit. A quick way to establish
bandit/friendly is to call out what is seen. For example,
“EAGLE 1, STATUS, HIGH/LOW.” The description should
be concise and discriminating. If Eagle 1 were above the
bandit, the expected reply would be “EAGLE 1, HIGH.”
Other discriminators might be offensive/defensive, left
turn/right turn, nose high/nose low, north/south,
pushing/pulling, etc.


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_19.jpeg:
SEPARATE -— Leaving a specific engagement; may or may
not reenter.

BUGOUT - Separation from that particular engagement/
attack/operation with no intent to reengage/return.

BLIND — No visual contact with friendly aircraft; opposite of
VISUAL.

BLOW THROUGH - Directive/informative call that indicates
aircraft will continue straight ahead at the merge and not
turn with target.

BREAK (with direction) — Directive to perform an immediate
maximum performance turn in the indicated direction. This
call assumes a defensive situation.

DEFENSIVE -— Aircraft is in a defensive position and is
maneuvering with respect to A/A threat. In establishing
ACM roles, the aircraft calling “DEFENSIVE” initially
assumes the engaged role.

ENGAGED — Maneuvering with the intent of achieving a
kill. The term is also used to initiate the establishment of
ACM roles.

FOX — Air-to-air weapons employment.
HARD (with direction) — High G energy sustaining turn.

MERGE(D) — Information that friendlies and targets have
arrived in the same visual arena. This call indicates radar
returns have come together.

NEGATIVE -— Simply means no, requested action is denied
(reserved for flight lead).

NO JOY — Aircrew does not have visual contact with the
target/bandit; opposite of TALLY.

POSIT — Request for position; response normally in terms of
clock position, cardinal direction, geographic landmark or off
a common reference point.

Basic Rules for Good Flight Communication

Do not waste words. Know and use the standard brevity code from
AFTTP 3-1.

Always be directive, pause with the microphone unkeyed (to listen),
observe the directive action being performed, then be descriptive. When
needed, repeat the directive call. Even in a permissive communications
environment, a couple of seconds may mean the difference between
survival and a long walk home.

Speak slowly and distinctly. If you are not understood, you are not
contributing to flight situational awareness. Consider limitations of

secure and Have Quick radios.

Listen! Communication is two-way and requires you to listen on the
radio. This also means to keep intercockpit communication to a minimum.

AAM-9 D-14


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_21.jpeg:
WEAPONS DECONFLICTION

Once the roles are established by use of good ACM communication, the
next step usually involves the employment of ordnance. Under normal
circumstances, the engaged fighter is either pressuring the bandit
offensively or in a defensive situation near the bandit. From these
positions, shot deconfliction is not normally a concern for the engaged
fighter. However, one of the support fighter’s primary concerns should be
shot deconfliction to avoid fratricide.

AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17 has specific doctrine for shot deconfliction but the
flight lead may use simplified rules of thumb. These should be briefed and
understood thoroughly. The support fighter is capable and allowed to
employ ordnance from various positions in relation to the fight. Because
of this, the support fighter needs to pay special attention to the rules for
shot deconfliction and use the appropriate weapon for the situation
presented. It is critical that you are able to employ ordnance within these
rules, since fratricide is obviously unacceptable in all circumstances.

Refer to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17 for information on the AIM-7, AIM-9 and
AIM-120 shot deconfliction criteria. Only the gun will be addressed here.

For a variety of reasons, the gun may be the only weapon available. The
biggest advantage of using the gun is that it is very discriminating when
used properly and can produce a clean, surgical kill. It is also all-aspect
with a minimum range driven only by the desire of the F-15E aircrew to
avoid collision with bandit debris. The disadvantage is the high level of
concentration required to be effective. In addition, slowing down to use
the gun in a multibogey environment is not conducive to long-term
survival.


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_22.jpeg:
OFFENSIVE ACM

Offensive ACM emphasizes working as a two-ship to kill the threat. Once
again, the key to successful employment of the two-ship depends on your
ability to work with your lead and fulfill the element contracts of engaged
and support fighters. Key ingredients of this phase include formations,
radar search patterns, intercept procedures as a two-ship, weapons
employment, merge/postmerge tactics, good BFM skills and intraflight
communication.

Formations and radar search patterns depend on the individual flight
lead’s desires. Intercepts are primarily single-side offsets (lower aspect
targets) and brackets (high aspect targets). Weapons employment
depends on the rules of engagement (VID versus BVR).

Normally, an offensive ACM objective is to turn at the merge and kill the
bandit in minimum time using a fluid attack system. By the merge,
someone should be designated as the engaged fighter and someone should
be the support fighter. If engaged, your primary goal should be weapons
employment and killing the bandit or at least keeping the bandit
predictable. As the support fighter, maneuver as required to support the
engaged fighter. The best support you can give is to kill the bandit so the
flight does not get anchored!

2 v 1 Intercepts

Approaching the merge, the element must determine what ACM actions
are needed. Gaining the tally, determining how many bandits are alive,
deciding on the appropriate tactic, identifying friend or foe and merging
with an advantage are all important parts of the ACM problem at the
merge.

The two most common scenarios that will cause 2 v 1 merges are a
remaining bandit after BVR shots or a VID requirement of a bogey in your
AOR. It is assumed for the purposes of training that the element can
recognize a remaining bandit and employ premerge to kill. The VID
situation is a different problem altogether.

Basic intercept tactics remain the same with single-side offset and bracket

being the primary options. For the purposes of ACM, the intercept
discussion is joined at the VID decision.

AAM-9 D-16


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_23.jpeg:
Single-Side Offset (SSO)

With an unaware or low aspect bogey (< 15 AA), the VID scenario from a
SSO is simply a stern conversion as an element. However, the wingman
must gain enough separation from lead at the merge to be able to employ
ordnance once the bogey is declared a bandit. This is accomplished by
deploying to a wider formation and gaining an altitude stack. The flight
lead flies the normal pursuit geometry and goes pure NLT 10 nm. The
wingman should use the bogey’s altitude to determine whether to stack
high or low. Coming from the opposite portion of the sky as lead will help
deny tally two.

Gaining a split of approximately 3-4 nm will help the wingman keep
visual while ensuring the bogey cannot minimum range any WEZs if it
turns into the wingman at the merge. When taking this turning room, the
wingman must avoid gimballing the contact while trying to get the desired
split, striving to be pure NLT 7 nm.

Both members of the element need to work for the tally (always assuming
more than one). The wingman needs to keep both tally and visual to avoid
shot deconfliction problems postmerge.

As lead approaches the merge, the wingman should be assessing available
shots and selecting the appropriate weapon for the situation. Expect to
hear “EAGLE 1, ENGAGED, BOGEY” at some point. The best answer for
the support fighter is “EAGLE 2, TALLY,” thereby establishing roles.
After visually identifying the bogey, lead will say “EAGLE 1, MERGED,
HOSTILE, HOSTILE” and with shot deconfliction requirements met, the
wingman should employ ordnance to kill.


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_24.jpeg:
If the wingman has sufficient separation and altitude split, entry into the
fight should be simple regardless of the bandit’s first move. If the bandit
turns belly up to engage lead, the wingman flies BFM to maneuver to a
shot(s) and kills before the following merge. If the bandit turns into the
wingman and is unaware, the wingman should use a front aspect weapon
and follow up with BFM using the established vertical turning room. In
either case shown in Figure D-1, if the wingman is unable to employ
ordnance or gain a kill, the wingman is expected to BFM the bandit and
call “EAGLE 2, ENGAGED?” if necessary.

Bracket

In the case of the aware or high aspect bogey (= 16 AA), the flight lead can
choose to bracket the bogey NLT 15 nm. Whether from a SSO or flying
directly at the bogey, the wingman may need to maneuver away from the
bogey’s nose and stack opposite of lead to help the bracket. Forcing the
bogey to look in two different areas will help to deny tally two. The
primary goal of the bracket is to force the bogey to commit on one of the
fighters.

The bracket is a visual formation flown to approximately 4-5 nm wide and
usually bracketing the bogey in altitude, although this may not always be
possible. The radio call should be “EAGLE 1, BRACKET, BOGEY, BRA
030/20, 15,000.” Again, the wingman should take care not to gimbal when
maneuvering and be pure as soon as the geometry will allow.
Determining who the bogey is committed on can be done with the tally or
with the radar and the bogey’s aspect. For this example, the wingman
will recognize the bogey’s aspect decreasing and should communicate
“EAGLE 1, BOGEY’S HOT ON YOU.” At this point, the wingman should
go pure and, in effect, lead turn the bogey to enter the merge in a position
of advantage.

Approaching the merge, lead should call “EAGLE 1, ENGAGED” and the
wingman can best acknowledge with an “EAGLE 2, TALLY” call. At the
merge (Figure D-2), the wingman has similar choices for shots and
engaging the bogey once lead declares “EAGLE 1, MERGED, HOSTILE,
HOSTILE.” Again, shot deconfliction and flying BFM to kill the bandit
are the keys to success.

Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_26.jpeg:
Separation

From either scenario, assuming lead is responsible for the VID and the
wingman for affecting a quick kill, the next step is for the element to
separate from the fireball. This is where the support fighter’s SA is
needed to help the flight escape. The engaged fighter is usually slow after
flying BFM to kill the bandit, so initially the engaged fighter will want to
separate straight ahead. The support fighter can help by directing a new
heading based on where safe airspace is and where both fighters can
regain mutual support. The bottom line is someone needs to get on the
radio and initiate the separation with a heading. The flight lead will
probably have to refine the heading to expedite the rejoin to tactical
formation once out of the immediate area.

The first goal of the separation is to leave the area of the fireball, which
may attract attention. Proper mechanics for the separation are critical for
both fighters. Best acceleration, visual lookout and spike inventory are
important to getting out of the immediate area. Once the initial
maneuvering has begun, the element can use check turns to get back to
tactical formation and increase mutual support.

An important part of mutual support is visual lookout, so be careful not to
get buried in the jet and forget to check six. This is one benefit of a
two-seat aircraft. The WSO can focus on checking six and gaining/keeping
the visual. The pilot, on the other hand, should focus on short-range radar
work.

Short-range radar work starts with AUTO GUNS in the direction of the
separation or any turns during the separation. First, each pilot should
clear the area off the nose for immediate threats. Do not forget to visually
search for other bandits out of the radar’s coverage. Once the AUTO
GUNS search has cleared that area, each pilot should bias the coverage to
the briefed search area. Remember to accurately place the acquisition
symbols whenever slewing to avoid burying the search in the dirt or
looking up into space. After 10-15 seconds of search, the pilot should
select short-range missile (SRM) to expand coverage and search area to
20 nm. Once this area is clear, the pilot can select medium range missile
and initiate a radar/visual handoff, as briefed, to the WSO.

Whether separating from an alive threat or bugging out after a kill, the
mechanics of the separation, the regaining of mutual support, the
short-range radar game plan and the visual lookout for bandits are all
important steps to successfully escaping a merge/engagement with a
bandit.

AAM-9 D - 20


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_27.jpeg:
Postmerge Maneuvering

A number of maneuver options exist after a merge based on the results of
the merge and the actions of the bandit. If the bandit remains unaware
until after the merge, stern entry maneuvering will be required. Stern
entries may include the support fighter exiting the fight and maneuvering
for areentry. Initially, these reentries will be practiced from perch setups
as described in the Air-to-Air Phase Manual.

If the bandit becomes aware of at least one of the fighters prior to the
merge, high aspect maneuvering will be required. These situations will
usually involve one fighter anchored in a HABFM fight and the other
maneuvering for a reentry or weapons separation to employ ordnance.
These situations are initially presented in the first 180° of turn during the
intercepts. These more dynamic situations will be started from butterfly
OACM setups. For any of the above situations, it is important for the
support fighter to understand the mechanics of how to reenter the fight,
although it should be emphasized that a complete reentry may not always
be required. The primary goal should be to kill the bandit.


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_28.jpeg:
Reentering the Fight as the Support Fighter

Support Fighter Position

The support fighter’s position must allow for fulfilling the responsibilities
as previously listed. In addition, the support fighter must be able to
assume the engaged fighter responsibilities if the situation dictates. In
relation to the fight, the support fighter should strive to stay 2-5 nm away.
This range window keeps the support fighter far enough away to deny the
bandit a shot opportunity, but close enough to keep tally and visual.
Extending further than 5 nm makes the fight difficult to see and it will
take too long to reenter the fight. Your goal is to only go far enough to
gain turning room and find an entry to a WEZ (which may be all-aspect
ordnance from well outside the fight). Also, your flight path should keep
the fight between 7 o’clock and 10 o’clock or 5 o’clock and 2 o’clock. Do not
allow the fight to drift to 6 o’clock; if you do, you may quickly extend
beyond visual range. Pointing directly at the fight is only good for
ordnance employment or entry into the fight. The support fighter’s flight
path should be a series of hard turns and extensions outside the fight.
Airspeed should be approximately 425-450 KCAS (near corner velocity)
with power as necessary to maintain energy (4-6 Gs). The extensions
should be 5-10 seconds maximum, allowing energy to be gained/
maintained while turning in an unpredictable manner. By stacking no
closer than 2000 feet vertically to the fight, the support fighter can
preclude bandit tallies while preserving turning room. The closer you are
to the fight, the more vertical turning room is required to allow an entry
and deny the bandit a shot opportunity.

Support fighter reentries can occur in either stabilized turning fights or
slow speed neutral fights. In either case, the support fighter must exit the
fight, gain turning room (as above) and look to reenter the fight in one of
the following three ways.

Support Fighter Reentries

Two types of reentries are the co-flow entry (also called the fan entry) and
the counter-flow entry. Depending on the progression of the fight, the
direction of turning in the fight and the position of the fight relative to the
support fighter, one type will be more advantageous than the other. You
might not always be able to choose which type you will use. Your first
priority is to get away from the fight to obtain turning room. Put the fight
at 5 or 7 o'clock. Once you have done this, you will need to turn back to
begin setting up your entry. Put the fight at 10 or 2 o’clock. The direction
you turn dictates a co-flow or a counter-flow entry.

AAM-9 D - 22


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_29.jpeg:
When coming back you need to make a conscious decision which way to
turn. Among the things to consider are keeping the tally/visual,
preserving turning room, not flying in front of the bandit and not
highlighting yourself. As a general rule, turn back in the direction that
will allow you to (in order of preference) not become threatened, keep the
tally/visual, have the quickest entry/shot and continue to turn in the
direction you are already going.

If your choice of entry requires a change of direction, then the earlier you
decide, the closer to the fight you will be and the easier it will be to keep
tally/visual. This reversal needs to be an initial hard turn to place the
fight on the other side of the tail, which will aid in rapid regain of
tally/visual.

Co-Flow Entry

The co-flow entry (Figure D-3) is one in which the support fighter enters
the fight going the same direction as the bandit.

Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_30.jpeg:
The advantage of the co-flow entry is that the line of sight is less;
therefore, it is easier to judge your entry. The disadvantage is that it
requires the bandit to be predictable and to not have you in sight. With
sufficient vertical turning room (5000-8000 feet), the co-flow entry can be
made from inside the bandit’s turn circle. It should be obvious that
airspeed awareness and power modulation will become a factor if
attempting more vertical entries.

Counter-Flow Entry

The counter-flow entry involves the support fighter and the bandit turning
in opposite directions (Figure D-4).

f BANDIT

AAM-09-04

Figure D - 4. Counter-Flow Entry.

The advantage of the counter-flow entry is that the bandit will probably
not see the support fighter (assuming a benign background and a good
vertical split). The disadvantage is that the higher closure rates make the
entry harder to judge.

Judging your reentries will be based on the bandit’s nose position relative
to you and your distance from the fight. The rule of thumb for when to
start your reentry is the bandit’s nose passing through your position
relative to the fight. This rule of thumb is based on being approximately
2-3 nm away from the fight. If the altitude stack is sufficient, the bandit
will not be able to threaten you easily. Be aware, if the engaged fighter
does not fly good BFM, the bandit will be free of pressure and may be able
to change flight paths enough to threaten you. So, while waiting for your
reentry cues, be ready to use CMD and defeat the missile threat.

AAM-9 D - 24


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_31.jpeg:
Once the bandit’s nose position passes, you will need to rotate your lift
vector and lead turn the bandit. As you begin the reentry, it is a good
technique to notify the engaged fighter of your intentions with an
“EAGLE 2, IN FROM HIGH” call, for example. In-plane or out-of-plane
maneuvering will depend on the turning room available. HOTAS and
energy management are important areas to control as you enter the fight.
When choosing an auto acquisition mode, remember to consider the
proximity of the engaged fighter and the bandit. Boresight will be the
most discriminating mode. If you have radar problems or inadvertently
lock the engaged fighter, be ready to reattempt the lock or use a boresight
AIM-9. While pointing at the fight during the reentry, be sure to control
your airspeed to ensure you do not enter too fast or arrive at the bandit’s
turn circle with no energy. You should not hesitate to take deconflicted
shots. Just prior to reaching a position where you can maintain pressure
on the bandit and can accept the responsibilities of the engaged fighter,
you should call “EAGLE 2, ENGAGED.” Be ready for an “UNABLE” or
“NEGATIVE” call and the need to maintain deconfliction. You may also
have to give visual information to the flight lead. Follow-on BFM is very
critical here. Pointing at the bandit while entering the fight will lead to a
fast, high HCA entry and usually an overshoot. In the event of an
“UNABLE” or “NEGATIVE” call, have a plan to abort your entry and
maneuver for a new reentry if necessary.


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_32.jpeg:
Slow Speed Fight Entry

The third way of reentering a fight involves entering a slow speed fight
that may be in a scissors or a tree. This is the hardest fight to enter and
requires the most communication to ensure intentions are understood.

The key to reentering a slow speed fight is to know that it is slow speed.
Entering with extra energy is still required but you will not want a
300-400 knot advantage. Initially, you will want to position yourself to
gain a perspective on the fight. This perspective and a “POSIT” or
“STATUS” call can help you be sure of which aircraft is which if you are
uncertain. If you are entering a tree or scissors, attempt to start your
entry behind the fight with 45-90° of angle-off. This will allow you to
maintain good tally/visual, keep some extra energy and maintain 3/9
control (Figure D-5).

Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_33.jpeg:
You will need to time your entry and shots to avoid crossing problems in
the slow speed fight. There is no need to call “ENGAGED” as the support
fighter since the response would be “UNABLE.” Just determine which
aircraft is the bandit, ensure shot deconfliction and kill the bandit as soon
as possible. The two things you cannot afford to do are to get three
aircraft slow in the same airspace or to dash through the middle of a slow
speed fight. It may be required to use the radio and directive
communication to ensure deconfliction. For example, “EAGLE 1, COME
OFF, HARD RIGHT NOW!” would build in some separation for a
deconflicted shot. Realize that you had better kill the bandit or you could
put your flight lead in a precarious position!

Areas to Avoid

In order to fulfill the support fighter responsibilities, you should avoid
being directly below or within 2 nm of the fight for prolonged periods.

Entering directly from below the fight poses problems. The fight is
probably descending down toward you, which may take away some of the
turning room you have just acquired. Also, you will bleed off energy as
you try to bring your nose up to enter the fight.

Trying to enter the fight from within 2 nm (horizontally) should be
avoided as well. Inside 12,000 feet, the support fighter may not have the
required turning room and G available to employ ordnance. This causes
(at best) rushed shots and (at worst) missed opportunities to engage.
More distance allows the support fighter time to predict the entry and
react to the situation. Flying inside 12,000 feet may also allow the bandit
opportunities to employ ordnance against you while the engaged fighter is
maneuvering and not posing an immediate threat.

Entering From Above the Fight

Depending on your experience, flying directly above the fight may force
the support fighter to focus attention on the fight geometry instead of
clearing the area for other bandits. If this type of entry is attempted, the
support fighter should be able to align turn circles easily, but must avoid
getting too fast during the entry.

This maneuver can be difficult and often results in an overshoot because
of the inability to slow down enough in a very nose low attitude. This is
known as the “high speed cheerleader” pass through the fight. However,
if done correctly, entering the fight from above can be an effective
maneuver.

Reentry Exercises

When the bandit breaks into the support fighter, the best BFM maneuver
is to maneuver to the bandit’s turn circle for a lag maneuver. Once at the
turn circle, the support fighter will probably have lots of heading crossing
angles, but the flight lead should be pressuring the bandit around the
turn circle. At this point, the support fighter makes a choice of turning in
the same direction as the fight (co-flow) (Figure D-6) or turning in the
opposite direction (counter-flow) (Figure D-7). When going co-flow,
keeping the tally will help get the fight to 5 o’clock. When switching the
turn direction to counter-flow, using the visual on lead will help to place
the fight at 7 o’clock. On exiting the turn circle, the support fighter should
aggressively climb or descend to get out-of-plane, and extend away from
the fight for some horizontal turning room. Co-flow entries take a little
longer to develop, but are more easily controlled. Going counter-flow
generally results in the earliest reentry opportunity, but timing the entry
can be difficult.

High Aspect ACM Setups

While bracket and SSO entries to the merge were used to tie the intercept
to the merge, the scenarios included an unaware bandit whose
maneuvering was limited postmerge to BFM on the identifying fighter.
High aspect ACM is used to practice the more likely scenario of an aware
bandit at the merge and/or of a short-range pickup by the element, which
limits time to take turning room and requires quick reactions and
communication to affect a kill.

The short-range scenario provided by the butterfly setup should begin
with a “SNAPLOCK” or tally initiated “ENGAGED” call. The flight lead
should brief any rules for engaging short-range contacts. The roles must
be established. For this workbook, the wingman will begin as the support
fighter. Approaching the merge with the roles established allows both
fighters to better fulfill their roles while flying the best possible BFM.
Typically, if not announced over the radio, the aircraft merging with the
bandit is assumed to be the engaged fighter. The other fighter should be
able to gain a lead turn and fulfill support responsibilities as required.

In general, bracketing a high aspect bandit results in the earliest
opportunity for the fighter element to employ ordnance against the bandit.
A smart bandit will attempt to keep both fighters on the same side of his
aircraft. Do not let him! The bandit that turns away presents a WEZ to
the support fighter right away. The bandit that turns into the wingman is
a little more difficult to handle.


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_36.jpeg:
High Aspect, Bracket, Turn Into, No Switch

The support fighter should get a lead turn and, depending on turning
room available, be able to shoot once lead is clear of the merge. If the
turning room is insufficient or shot deconfliction is a problem, as in
short-range pickups, the support fighter may be able to use the vertical to
quickly kill the bandit. The caution here is that the original engaged
fighter will most likely be anchored in a one-circle fight and the engaging
wingman will be trailing the bandit through a subsequent merge(s).

This makes deconfliction a problem. As the engaged fighter, if lead is
unable to leave the neutral situation due to BFM requirements or becomes
anchored or defensive, the wingman should expect to maintain
deconfliction responsibilities when maneuvering to kill the bandit. Shot
deconfliction problems will require patience due to the slow speed nature
of the fight.

If the vertical is unavailable, the support fighter should plan to execute a
fight exit to reentry. Slow speed fight reentry techniques will be critical.
From either case, expect the fighter in the one-circle fight to need to
separate straight ahead initially to gain airspeed (Figure D-8).

High Aspect Bracket, Turn Into, Switch

The bandit may become aware of the support fighter as it approaches the
merge. In this case, expect the bandit to min range the engaged fighter’s
ordnance and break defensively into the lead turning support fighter.
This will be made clear when the bandit turns into the support fighter’s
plane of motion. Awareness of what both fighters are doing becomes
critical here. Whichever aircraft sees the switch needs to call “BANDIT
SWITCHED.” The support fighter should consider calling “ENGAGED,
ANCHORED, ONE-/TWO-CIRCLE,” expecting to hear “PRESS” to
exchange roles following a bandit switch (Figure D-8). If the bandit
continues to fight Eagle 2, Eagle 1 should have an easy co-flow entry,
provided the vertical is used properly. If the bandit switches back to
Eagle 1 for a one-circle fight, another “BANDIT SWITCHED?” call should
be made and if necessary, another role exchange should be accomplished.
Eagle 1 should have some extra lead turn and the support fighter should
be given an exit for a reentry as shown in Figure D-9.

An aware bandit or a late pickup may force the fighter formation to
engage in an offset formation. These scenarios are discussed based on
limited turning room and lead starting as the engaged fighter.

High Aspect, Offset, Turn Into, No Switch

Attacking a high aspect bandit from an offset formation provides some
more difficult choices. However, the first priority is to fly your best BFM
while maintaining flight path deconfliction, so lead turn, lead turn, lead
turn (Figure D-10)! At the merge, it may be difficult to determine which
fighter the bandit is turning with, so clear communication is critical in
this engagement. If you are sure that you are the support fighter, you
may use your lead turn advantage and the vertical to achieve the first
shot. Be aware of your flight lead’s position for potential shot
deconfliction problems.

The support fighter will not always be able to achieve a quick shot and
may need to maneuver to the control zone. As the support fighter becomes
the engaged fighter, deconfliction should shift to the element lead as the
support fighter. However, it is important to recognize the merge problems
associated with this scenario. Figure D-11 shows how a role exchange
occurs during a subsequent merge. If the roles were swapped late in the
two-circle fight, the new support fighter (lead) may still need to merge to
defend against the bandit’s missiles. The new engaged fighter will need to
keep some SA on both aircraft and shot deconfliction until after the merge
when the new support fighter can separate for a reentry.

High Aspect, Offset, Turn Into, Switch

A disadvantage in this type of engagement with an aware bandit is that
both the engaged and support fighter are on the same side of the bandit’s
canopy. This makes it easy for the bandit to keep track of both fighters
and may make it possible for the bandit to switch between the two
fighters multiple times. If the bandit switches at the merge to the support
fighter, two options exist. The first option involves both fighters turning
two-circle (Figure D-12), which should allow lead to rate fight to an
advantage while the wingman continues to fight two-circle looking for an
advantage from another switch by the bandit. This scenario may lead to
subsequent merges but one of the fighters should have an advantage.
Poor BFM by either fighter here usually results in a free-switching bandit
in the middle of the formation.

The second option is for one of the fighters to take the bandit single-circle
at the merge to force a predictable fight and to keep the fighters aft of the
bandit’s 3/9 line (Figure D-13). This is usually best done by the second
fighter merging with the bandit if BFM will allow. The disadvantage here
is that one of the fighters must “get in the phone booth” with the bandit
while the other fighter works for the entry, sorts out who is who in the
single-circle fight and waits for shot deconfliction to happen.

There are many permutations possible in a high aspect ACM engagement.
The bandit may enjoy some initial freedom to switch, but should become
defensive quickly if the element is working together and fulfilling their
roles. No matter which scenario, the basic tenets remain the same—fly
your best BFM, maintain flight path deconfliction and maneuver to kill
the bandit.

AAM-9 D - 36


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_43.jpeg:
Engaging Other Threats

The support fighter’s job is to keep the engaged fighter free to kill the
bandit. In part, this means killing any bandit who may become a factor to
the fight. Often, the support fighter gets a tally on another bandit looking
for an entry on the engaged fighter. The support fighter must engage this
new threat and quickly kill the bandit before the engaged fighter is forced
to react. Radar contacts may present a threat as well. These contacts
must be analyzed in terms of their range and aspect in relation to the
fight. Normally, split criteria are briefed to give the support fighter a
decision making aid on whether to engage this new threat or monitor/drop
it. For more on split criteria refer to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17.

Separation/Bugout

As discussed in the 2 v 1 intercepts section, the end result of each
engagement needs to be a separation from the bandit or a bugout from the
fireball. Deciding whether to reengage an alive bandit will be the flight
lead’s responsibility or based on defensive BFM requirements. If able to
bugout, exiting the area near the fireball is the primary concern. Regain
mutual support and formation as soon as the situation allows.

DEFENSIVE ACM

In order to prosecute/defeat a short-range attack, the bandit must first be
detected. Detecting bandits is a continuous effort. Element members
must clear the area around their flight for new bandits and multiquadrant
attacks. The complete attention of both element members cannot be
focused on a single bandit attacking them. The support fighter, in
particular, must be alert for additional bandits. Detection can occur
visually, with radar, RWR or from a GCI/AWACS point out. To
successfully defeat a short-range attack, visual acquisition by at least one
element member early in the defensive initial move sequence is essential.
Once the bandits are detected, a rapid assessment must be made of the
threat. If bandits are out of range and have insufficient closure, extend.
Bandits at or approaching weapons parameters must be countered with
an initial move by the element. In general, adhere to the following steps:
detect bandit(s), direct an initial move, defeat any attack with proper
BFM and AAMD, provide mutual support within the element and gain the
offensive or disengage/separate.


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_44.jpeg:
The basis of successful two-ship defense is a system of well thought out
initial moves. The moves must effectively negate the initial attack. They
must be aggressive and designed to rotate the vulnerable cones away from
the threat. There is no room for error; initial moves must be simple and
easy to remember. Lastly, initial moves must become almost second
nature; only practice will help.

When the bandit is sighted in the aft quadrant approaching missile range
you should avoid putting both aircraft in the same area at the same time.
When possible, split the element laterally and vertically (i.e., good tactical
formation). In addition, the aircrew with the tally should simultaneously
start a hard/break turn into the bandit, direct the flight to maneuver with
communication and dispense chaff/flares as required. The aircrew
without a tally should turn as directed, dispense preemptive chaff/flares,
pull maximum Gs and attempt to acquire the tally.

The difference between a hard and break turn is power selection and
G-loading. In both cases, turn the aircraft to rotate your vulnerable cone
while bringing the threat to your nose. If the bandit is definitely outside
of weapons parameters and you have good energy, you may be able to
perform a good 8-10 AOA extension in full AB and separate out of the
fight. Be sure the bandit is far enough outside of a WEZ that you are
willing to bet your (and your wingman’s) life on it! A hard turn should be
called if a bandit is maneuvering for a shot but definitely not in weapons
parameters. Maximum AB in a hard turn assures maximum energy, but
be careful not to enter a WEZ in full AB. If the bandit is in position to
shoot or has taken a shot, a break turn in mil power or less while
dispensing chaff and flares offers the best defense. Afterburner should be
selected as soon as the bandit’s nose is no longer in position to shoot, or is
outside valid weapons parameters. If it is evident that the bandit intends
to pursue the attack, stores jettison may be appropriate, if so configured.

If it is apparent from the beginning that the flight cannot separate, the
object should be to defeat any bandit ordnance, sandwich the bandit and
achieve a kill or separation, or force the bandit to separate. The bandit
determines who is engaged; the other fighter maneuvers to bring ordnance
to bear. However, communication is still required so there is no
misunderstanding as to who the support fighter is (deconfliction
responsibility).

Visual Lookout Responsibilities and Range Estimation

Primary areas for visual search are shown in Figure D-14. (The
designations 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B indicate the flight position and crew
position; e.g., 1A refers to the lead pilot, 2B refers to the wingman’s WSO.)
As the tactical situation changes, primary areas of visual search
responsibilities also change. Visibility across the formation to the outside
is degraded with increasing distance. At the maximum horizontal and
vertical separation, a bandit may arrive in a weapons envelope behind a
fighter before being visually acquired. Therefore, tactical formation
spreads depend on the size and type of threat expected.

Figure D - 14. Primary Areas of Visual Search.

Note that the pilots have primary responsibility for lookout forward of the
3/9 line and WSOs have the responsibility aft of the 3/9 line. A good
technique is to crew coordinate your visual lookout. For example, the pilot
would say, “I’m outside and to the right” and the WSO would concentrate
visual lookout on the left of the formation. Remember that an extra pair
of eyes is a great advantage in the visual arena. Do not squander that
advantage by having both crew members searching the same piece of sky.


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_46.jpeg:
Figure D-15 shows the references for range estimation behind your
leader’s aircraft from line abreast formation. By using aircraft references
for 30° aft (just off the inlet ramp) and 60° aft Gust off trailing edge of the
wingtip), you can estimate how far behind the formation the bandit is. A
simple rule of thumb exists for the 45° aft reference of looking down the
wing line: the bandit’s range behind your wingman is equal to your line
abreast tactical range. For example, if you are 9000 feet line abreast from
your wingman, then the bandit is 9000 feet behind your wingman.
Getting exact ranges is not important, but knowing whether or not the
bandit is in a WEZ will determine whether you call for a break turn
versus a hard turn.

Bandit Attack Options

A single bandit has four basic attack options: no switch, early switch, late
switch and uncommitted bandit at six. This section discusses each option
and an appropriate response.

No Switch

The bandit attacks one element member and does not switch. Response:
both Eagles should break into the bandit. In Figure D-16, the bandit
attacks Eagle 1 who flies the best possible defensive BFM while Eagle 2
flies the best possible offensive BFM to employ a missile. Eagle 2 must
use caution during the initial move to control the radar and AIM-9M
because of the potential for fratricide as the bandit and Eagle 1 are in
close proximity after 90-120° of turn when the shot opportunity occurs.
Eagle 1 cannot immediately separate from this attack unless the bandit
goes for pure pursuit and a high-angle snapshot. Eagle 2 must be
prepared to continue flying BFM should shot deconfliction, poor HOTAS or
bandit maneuvering deny the quick kill.

Early Switch

In this example, the bandit attacks Eagle 2, but switches quickly to

Eagle 1 (Figure D-17). The bandit starts the switch prior to losing 3/9 line
advantage (thus, early switch) on Eagle 1. Caution: do not confuse bandit
BFM with an early switch. Response: when the bandit switches, Eagle 1
should call “BANDIT SWITCHED.” Eagle 2 should continue to turn until
tally, then extend for energy and turning room, get out of plane and set up
an entry. Normally the flight cannot separate from an early switch.

Eagle 1 is now engaged and Eagle 2 has the option for a co-flow or
counter-flow entry.

Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_50.jpeg:
Late Switch

The bandit attacks Eagle 1 and then switches to Eagle 2 when ahead of
Eagle 2’s 3/9 line (Figure D-18). Response: Eagle 1 executes the initial
move in the called direction and strives for a tally. Eagle 2 breaks into the
bandit. When the bandit switches, Eagle 2 calls “BANDIT SWITCHED”
and meets the bandit at high aspect. The element can normally separate
on a late switch if Eagle 2 flies good BFM and merges 180 out with the
bandit. In this case, Eagle 2 is closest to the bandit and should make the
separation call. The separation normally looks like a 1-3 nm echelon/trail.
Eagle 2 must keep a tally during the separation to decide whether to
continue the separation or react defensively again. The element’s goal is
to separate and leave or to build enough separation to engage the bandit
high aspect after turning to engage.

Uncommitted Bandit

The bandit’s relative position may not clearly identify the F-15E under
attack. The bandit can come from any aspect. A quick assessment of the
bandit’s lethality to the flight must be made based on range and nose
position. If the bandit has not reached weapons employment parameters,
an extension (while monitoring the bandit) may be appropriate. If the
bandit presents a threat or continues to close, a prompt flight reaction is
required. This discussion addresses the principles valid for all potential
bandit attack axes. The initial move should accomplish five things: deny
a shot, present the bandit with maximum BFM problems, force the bandit
to commit on one or the other fighter, maximize the element’s offensive
potential after the initial move and clearly establish engaged (defensive)
and support fighter roles. Next, let us discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of a same direction break versus cross-turn, followed by
some examples.

There are several advantages to breaking in the same direction. The
aircraft on the outside of the turn is able to maintain tally throughout the
turn. The bandit must immediately commit against one fighter or the
other. The bandit’s offensive potential versus each fighter is no longer
identical. The element is in a position to establish defensive and support
fighter roles based on bandit reaction. Both aircraft can devote full
attention to flying the best BFM against the bandit since flight path
deconfliction is not difficult. Finally, each element member is able to
isolate the threat axis on the same side of their respective aircraft.

The second, but less desirable option, is to break the element toward each
other in a cross-turn or hard-to-six turn. There are several disadvantages
of the cross-turn including both fighters being in the same piece of sky,
which allows the bandit to delay the decision on which fighter to engage
until seeing a definite advantage. Also, element deconfliction is more
difficult initially, when the fighters should be more focused on the bandit.
A good stack by the wingman will reduce the deconfliction problem. A
cross-turn break may occur unintentionally for several reasons: a
simultaneous break call by both fighters (stepping on each other on the
radios) or in the heat of battle confusing which direction is left or right. If
this should happen, your best move is to continue the turn and be sure to
deconflict flight paths.


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_52.jpeg:
Now let us look at some examples. Like everything in air-to-air, your
reaction to a bandit at your flight’s mutual six depends on several factors.
How far back is the bandit? Who is the bandit threatening most? With a

bandit at the fighter element’s mutual six, it is in each fighter’s best
interest to turn into the bandit. The most likely scenario is for one fighter
to pick up the tally and call the flight to break. Assume Eagle 1 sees the
bandit and calls “EAGLE, BREAK RIGHT.” This is an acceptable
response. If one aircraft is able to assess that the bandit is threatening
the other, he can call “EAGLE X, BREAK LEFT/RIGHT,” and can break
in the other direction to engage the bandit. The bottom line is that as
soon as a bandit is detected, the fighters must start moving and this
begins with communication. The appropriate action depends on the
fighter’s assessment of the bandit at the tally.

TEXT

ACM is the link between basic intercepts and basic fighter maneuvers
(BFM). This lesson encompasses the critical elements of ACM, which
include premerge mechanics, element roles and responsibilities, element
communication, weapons employment, postmerge maneuvering, air
combat situational awareness and negating or separating from a threat.
While ACM is certainly not limited to a two-ship, the following discussion
will focus on the 2 v 1 employment aspects of a fighter element.

The three topics generic to all of ACM are fighter roles and
responsibilities, communication and weapons employment requirements.
These ACM elements are the foundation on which two aircraft can employ
to effectively kill or defeat a threat within lethal range.

FIGHTER ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

AFTTP 3-1 breaks down the possible roles of fighter aircraft into engaged
and support fighters. Each fighter in the formation must know what their
role is in an engagement to properly execute an attack or defeat a threat.
Once these roles are established, the responsibilities associated with each
role can be fulfilled. In all cases, every fighter is responsible for flying
effective BFM to avoid unnecessary losses and/or delays in killing or
defeating the threat.

Engaged Fighter versus Engaged

The difference between the term engaged and acting in the role of the
engaged fighter needs to be clarified. Engaged, as defined by AFTTP 3-1,
Volume 1, simply means the F-15E is maneuvering with the intent to kill.
This can apply anywhere on the BFM spectrum from offensive to
defensive. The majority of the time, this will apply to both F-15Ks.
However, setting the engaged fighter/support fighter roles must determine
two things: (1) who is doing their best BFM to kill/survive (engaged
fighter) and (2) who is ultimately responsible for deconfliction while also
executing smart BFM (support fighter).


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_8.jpeg:
Engaged and Support Roles

In an engagement, specific responsibilities must be assigned to each
aircraft. Effective communication is vital to fulfilling each fighter’s
responsibilities. In a 2 v 1 engagement, only one aircraft can be the
engaged fighter. The other aircraft assumes the support fighter
responsibilities. Roles can change several times during an engagement.
The appropriate responsibilities must be handed off and confirmed with
radio calls and aircraft maneuvers.

Engaged Fighter Responsibilities

e Best BFM to kill/survive — The engaged fighter executes its best
BFM to ultimately result in killing/surviving, no matter where it is
on the BFM spectrum—offensive/high aspect/defensive. The
engaged fighter’s game plan is the same as it would be if fighting
the bandit alone.

e Clear the F-15E’s flight path — Although the support fighter is
ultimately responsible for deconfliction, it does not relieve the
engaged fighter of clearing its own flight path. The engaged fighter
should strive to be tally and visual.

e Allow the support fighter to engage. If the support fighter becomes
defensive or has a more advantageous offensive entry and calls
“ENGAGED,” then the engaged fighter, if conditions permit, should
exchange the engaged/support fighter roles.

AAM-9 D-2


Text from AAM-9_ACM_page_9.jpeg:
Support Fighter Responsibilities

The support fighter’s list of responsibilities is longer because the job
changes with how offensive or defensive the engaged fighter is. The first
two responsibilities stand alone as the highest objectives for the support
fighter. Everything else is secondary. As the engaged fighter transitions
to being more offensive, the secondary responsibilities become as
important.

Maintain flight path deconfliction with the engaged fighter and
bandit. Beyond visual range (BVR), the support fighter must
remain visual. In the visual arena, the support fighter must
remain tally/visual or have constant SA of the bandit/engaged
fighter to ensure there is no chance of a flight path conflict.

Execute smart BFM maneuvers to avoid being shot and employ
ordnance with a clear field of fire. Smart BFM refers to the support
fighter’s maneuvering based on the engaged fighter’s BFM position.
If the engaged fighter is offensive, the support fighter’s goal is to
maneuver to achieve weapons separation for a missile shot. If the
engaged fighter is defensive, then the support fighter must
maneuver for immediate weapons employment. In this case, either
a missile or control zone entry to a gunshot is appropriate.

Secondary responsibilities include:

e Clear the fight for other adversaries that are a factor to the
element.

e Direct a defensive response or specific maneuver for weapons
deconfliction.

e Check own six.

e Maintain overall SA (area orientation, fuel and separation
opportunities).

These roles allow two aircraft to fight a threat with limited
communication and maximum awareness of what each fighter is
responsible for during an engagement.

PACS DISPLAY

The PACS display is accessible in both cockpits on the MPD/MPCD. It is
the part of the armament control system that is most used. Through it,
the aircrew can identify munitions on the stations, program firing/delivery
options, etc., and then monitor and release. Also, if desired, it is possible
to set up a training program to simulate all of the above.

Top Level PACS Menu
ARMT (armament) is one of the choices on MPD/MPCD Menu 1 and is

where to start. By pressing PB #2, the top level PACS menu is called up
(Figure D-3).

WEAPONS CONTROLS
Besides the PACS display, there are several other weapons controls.
Master Modes

A/A missiles can be fired in any master mode except A/G. A/G weapons
can only be delivered in A/G master mode. The trigger (FCP) is hot in all
master modes, if the gun is electrically and mechanically armed and the
master arm switch isin ARM. However, the gun will not fire unless both
the A/A and A/G PACS modes are in CMBT.

Armament Control Panel
The armament control panel (ACP), located in the front cockpit in the

lower left corner of the instrument panel, contains the selective jettison
knob/button and the master arm switch (Figure D-4).

ARMAMENT CONTROL
PANEL

Figure D - 4. Armament Control Panel.
Selective Jettison Knob/Button

The “knob” or outer part of this control rotates to select either a jettison
function or an alternate/manual release function. Pressing the “button,”
or inner part, releases stores depending on the position of the knob. Only
the OFF, COMBAT, and A/A positions are relevant for A/A weapons.
These functions are explained later in this lesson.

AAW-1 D-8


Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_15.jpeg:
Master Arm Switch

This lever-lock switch has two positions: SAFE and ARM (pull out, then
up over detent to select ARM). In SAFE, weapons cannot be employed
normally. In ARM, with the landing gear handle up or the armament
safety switch in OVERRIDE, power is provided for weapons employment
and gun firing. With ARM selected, a gun cross is displayed on the
HUD/HUD repeater and the RCP master arm green advisory light
illuminates.

Emergency Jettison Button

The emergency jettison or “panic” button is located in the front cockpit to
the left of the MPCD (Figure D-5). Pushing it once, with electrical power
on the aircraft, jettisons all carted stores and pylons, both on the ground
and in the air. The button must be held in for the duration of the jettison
sequence. If the button should get stuck in the jettison position, yellow
appears between the button and the black faceplate. Normally, only black
is visible around the button. The panic button is “hot” anytime electrical
power (ground power, emergency generator power, or main generator
power) is applied to the aircraft, regardless of the landing gear handle
position and weight on wheels.

Weapons Select Switch

This switch, located on the right throttle in the front cockpit, has three
positions: MRM, SRM, and GUN (Figure D-6). The MRM position allows
firing of either AIM-7 or AIM-120 air-to-air missiles and the SRM position
allows firing of AIM-9 missiles. The GUN (aft) position selects the A/A
master mode and gives the pilot command of the air-to-air radar.

A pickle button is located on both control stick grips (Figure D-7). When
pressed, this red button releases A/G weapons if all other logic is satisfied
and the master arm switch is in ARM. You must be in the A/G master
mode for the pickle button (both cockpits) to drop bombs. If you are in any
other master mode the pickle button (FCP only) launches missiles.

This two-position toggle switch is located in the FCP on the left console
outboard of the G-suit connection (Figure D-8). In the SAFE position,
weapons release (except via the panic button) is inhibited with the gear
handle down. In OVERRIDE (electrical power required to hold it there),
the landing gear handle safety circuit is bypassed.

Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_19.jpeg:
A/A PACS

The PACS is loaded manually or through the MC/DTM and is used to
accept digital data and interface signals from associated aircraft
equipment to perform the following:

e Selection, prelaunch preparation, launch, and jettison of A/A missiles

e OWS interface for proper computation of aircraft “G” loading
conditions

e CC interface for the display of accurate missile launch envelopes on
both the HUD and the radar.

For all of the above reasons, it is imperative that the programmed load
accurately reflects the actual aircraft configuration. To ensure this, the
PACS is used to do three things: verify, program, and monitor an A/A
weapons load.

A/A WEAPONS LOAD VERIFICATION

To verify that the PACS recognizes actual A/A configuration, turn on an
MPD/MPCD after engine start and select Menu 1 (Figure D-9, left), then
depress PB #2 (ARMT). This will get you to the top level PACS menu
(Figure D-9, right). This menu allows you to access major weapons
related options available for A/A training or combat mission operation.
Next, press PB #8 to display the “A/A COMBAT WEAPON LOAD?” display
(Figure D-9, bottom). This display reflects what the PACS recognizes as
currently loaded on the aircraft.

Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_21.jpeg:
With A/A missiles loaded, the display will initialize with missiles indicated
on the appropriate CFT stations or wing pylon stations (Figure D-10)
according to the following logic:

AIM-120: The AIM-120 exists in three variants: the A, B, and C.
The CC recognizes all three and will automatically identify the
correct type of missile and display it at the appropriate station on the
PACS display. AIM-120B/C missiles have an expanded weapon
identifier that is displayed directly below the missile type. For
example, TO7R06 identifies missile tape 07, revision 06 for
AIM-120C. Once identified, the AIM-120 type cannot be changed on
the A/A combat weapon load display. This is further emphasized by
the fact that there are no wire diagrams leading from the
pushbutton(s) to the loaded AIM-120 station (Figure D-11). On the
PACS, AIM-120s can appear on CFT stations 3C, 4C, 6C, and 7C,
and can also be loaded on wing pylon stations 2A, 2B, 8A, and 8B
(Figure D-10).

AIM-7: The AIM-7 exists in three variants: the F, M, and MH. The
CC will automatically identify the F and M versions (although some
early production AIM-7Ms identify as AIM-7Fs). However, if an
AIM-7MH is loaded, the aircrew must cycle through the appropriate
station pushbutton, (Figure D-9, PBs #6 and #10) in order to have the
PACS identify and display the H variant. AIM-7s will only appear on
CFT stations 3C, 4C, 6C, and 7C.

AIM-9: The AIM-9 exists in three variants: the P, L, and M. If an
AIM-9P series missile is loaded, the display will initialize with 9P3 at
the station. The station pushbutton will cycle between 9P3
(AIM-9P-2/P-3) and 9J (AIM-9P/P-1). If AIM-9L/Ms are loaded, the
display will initialize with 9L. Pressing the station pushbutton cycles
between 9L and 9M. AIM-9s will only appear on wing pylon stations
2 and 8.

M61A1 GUN: The gun rounds remaining count is displayed adjacent
to PB #1 (Figure D-9). Pressing the appropriate rounds pushbutton
(PB #1 or #2) will change the rounds remaining by either hundreds or
tens of rounds. The HUD will repeat the quantity set in the PACS
when A/A gun mode is selected. Pressing PB #20 cycles between
PGU-28 and M56 bullet types. This applies to actual or training
loads.

A/A TRAINING WEAPONS LOAD PROGRAMMING

Once you have verified that the PACS has correctly identified your actual
A/A weapons load, you can program a specific load for training purposes
by using the MC/DTM load you prepared during premission planning, or
by manually loading it through the PACS. The A/A TRAINING WEAPON
LOAD page is displayed in one of two ways, either by pressing PB #14
(A/A TRNG “boxed”) on the top level PACS menu, then pressing PB #8
(A/A LOAD), or by pressing PB #14 (“boxing” A/A TRNG) while on the A/A
COMBAT WEAPON LOAD display (Figure D-12). The “A/A TRAINING
WEAPON LOAD” display will now appear. Pressing the wing pylon
station pushbuttons will sequence the appropriate station through 9L,

9M, 9P3, 9J, 120A, 120B, 120C, blank, and back to 9L. Pressing the MRM
station pushbuttons will sequence the appropriate station through 7F,

7M, 7MH, 120A, 120B, 120C, blank, and back to 7F.

WARNING

The A/A TRNG mode should not be used
to simulate the release of A/A stores when
live A/A stores are loaded or when A/G
stores are loaded on the same station(s).
The A/A TRNG mode is authorized when
no live A/A stores are loaded and no A/G
stores are loaded on the same station(s).
The cold gun safing procedures in section
II (TO 1F-15E-34-1-1) may be used in lieu
of removing the rounds from the gun.

To monitor the new A/A TRAINING WEAPON LOAD, ensure A/A TRNG
is boxed (PB #14), press PB #11 (MENU) (Figure D-13A), then press A/A
(PB #2) (Figure D-13B). Also, the entire training load can be reinitialized
by pressing PB #14 (RESET) (Figure D-13C).

NOTE

The A/A TRNG mode is automatically deselected when any jettison
function or manual free-fall or retard (MAN FF/RET) is selected on the
armament control panel selective jettison knob. Although you can

program CBT JETT options into the training PACS, DO NOT “practice”
the capability, or any selected stores will be jettisoned if they are carted
and otherwise jettisonable. Pylons have actually been inadvertently
jettisoned in this way.

A/A COMBAT WEAPON LOAD MONITORING

To monitor the status of your actual A/A combat weapon load, press

PB #14 (A/A TRNG “unboxed”) (Figure D-14A) or press PB #14 (A/A
TRNG unboxed) and then PB #8 (A/A load) (Figure D-14B). Figure D-14C
reflects a possible weapons load seen at F-15E Formal Training Unit
(FTU).

NOTE

Remember that the PACS self-identifies most, but not all, of the various
AIM-120, AIM-7 and AIM-9 missile mods. Therefore, it is important to
know what variants of these missiles are loaded so that the PACS can be

programmed to reflect the correct missile load. Identifying the missile
load in the combat mode is as previously mentioned in the A/A training
section, with the exception that “A/A TRNG” at PB #14 should be
“unboxed!”

AIM-9L/M Legends

The THLD, SCAN, and COOL options (PBs #2, #8, and #13, respectively)
are boxed when selected (Figure D-16). The THLD and SCAN options
appear only when an AIM-9L/M is aboard and SRM is selected. The
substitution of STBY for an SRM legend on the priority station is another
indicator that SRM has been selected on the throttle and identifies the
priority AIM-9 for launch. A FAIL ID legend indicates a missile loaded
but the PACS cannot determine if the missile is an AIM-9/DAIS or
AIM-120. The missile is deleted from the launch sequence.

The COOL option appears with an AIM-9L or M aboard regardless of
weapon selection on the throttle. When the master arm switch is in ARM
(gear handle up), COOL is automatically selected and boxed. A boxed
RDY legend appears above the missile in launch priority (replacing STBY)
(Figure D-16) when the master arm switch is in ARM and the weapon
select switch is in SRM. An AIM-9L/M can also be manually cooled at any
time by selecting the cool option at PB #18.

Should a missile be launched (or jettisoned), the station legend goes blank.
HUNG is displayed whenever a missile fails to launch/jettison.

The PACS automatically selects the next missile in the firing sequence.
The aircrew can select a different station (including a different type AIM-9
if there is a mixed load of AIM-9Ms, -9Ls, and/or -9Ps by using the missile
reject switch. Missile reject is accomplished by moving the FCP boat
switch aft or RCP castle switch right.

AIM-7/AIM-120 Legends

STBY replaces the AIM-7F/M/MH MRM legend once the missile has
tuned. For the AIM-120, STBY indicates AIM-120 BIT complete. DGRD
denotes AIM-120 BIT complete, but the missile is degraded. The PACS
automatically places the degraded missile(s) last in launch priority. If an
AIM-120 fails the BIT, the FAIL-120A legend appears and the missile is
locked out of the launch sequence. If an AIM-7 fails to tune or detunes, it
is locked out of the launch sequence. FAIL ID indicates both an AIM-9
and AIM-120 missile identification signal present on the same station.
The missile is deleted from the firing sequence. HUNG is displayed
whenever a missile fails to launch/jettison.

A boxed RDY legend replaces STBY above the AIM-7 or AIM-120 missile
in launch priority when master arm is selected and the weapons select
switch is in MRM (Figures D-17 and D-18).

The aircraft CC determines the displayed target size based on an aircrew
manual input or an automatic selection. This is done at PB #2. The
automatic selection is based on target sizes corresponding to tables as
defined in TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1. Target size is sent to AIM-120Bs and Cs
when the expanded ident is greater than Tape 5 Revision 2 and up for the
AIM-120B and Tape 7 Revision 6 and up for AIM-120C. Earlier
AIM-120Bs or Cs and AIM-120As do get the target size algorithm. The
target size selection influences the AIM-120 fuze timing and is also sent to
the AIM-7MH for fuzing calculations.

AAW-1 D - 26


Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_33.jpeg:
With MRM selected on the weapons select switch and MRMs loaded on
the aircraft, SAUT XXX is displayed at PB #2. This option allows the pilot
to choose the target size estimate to be provided. With SAUT selected, the
radar will automatically select a target size and report back whether it is
SML, MED, LRG, or HOH, and display it under SAUT at PB #2 based on
information it sees from the target return. More discussion is available in
TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1. The default setting at PB #2 is SAUT MED.

If PB #2 is toggled, the target size is manually set by the aircrew to either
SMED, SSML, SLRG, or HOH, which will appear in the place of SAUT.
The last setting for PB #2 will remain in the CC until changed either
manually on the display or through entering from the MC/DTM.

A similar selection but for radar cross section instead of target size is
available at PB #8. RAUT is the automatic selection, and RMED, RSML,
and RLRG are manual selections. For more information on the details of
the available settings refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1.

PB #4 can be used to enter a flight number ID on the PACS when an
AIM-120 is on board and MRM is selected on the throttle weapon switch.
This selection is designed to prevent missile-to-missile mutual
interference between AIM-120s launched by aircraft in the same flight.
The option initializes at 1/1, or 1 aircraft of a 1-ship flight. Pressing

PB #4 cycles between 1/1, 1/2, 2/2, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, etc., to select your
flight position in a 2-ship or 4-ship flight. These settings can also be
entered via the MC/DTM.

With the weapon select switch in MRM (AIM-120s loaded), TRNG mode
not selected, and the master arm switch in SAFE, SEL BIT is displayed at
PB #5 allowing a BIT of individual AIM-120 missiles.

With the master arm switch on, MODS is displayed at PB #5 in place of
the SEL BIT. Refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1 for additional information.

PBs #6-10 are blank.

With AIM-120s loaded on the aircraft and CMBT PACS selected, the
telemetry (TM PWR) option is displayed (initialized unboxed) next to

PB #15. Pressing PB #15 selects the option and sends telemetry power to
all loaded AIM-120s (Figure D-17). The telemetry option is only
functional with instrumented AIM-120s or CATM-120s.

PB #12 will display A/G on all of the air-to-air PACS pages. Selecting this
button will switch the PACS to the air-to-ground monitor page.

PB #18 will display COOL and will be boxed if the master arm is on and
AIM-9L or Ms are loaded on the aircraft, no matter what position the
throttle weapons select switch is in.

Figure D-17 depicts the AIM-120 launch sequence and Figure D-18
depicts the AIM-7 launch sequence. Normally, the AIM-120s on stations 2
and 8 are launched from the wings first in order of left outboard (2A),
right outboard (8B), left inboard (2B), and right inboard (8A), followed by
those loaded on the CFT stations in the order of left aft (4C), right aft
(6C), left forward (8C), and right forward (7C). AIM-7s on the CFT
stations, however, are launched in the order of left forward (8C), right
forward (7C), left aft (4C), and right aft (6C) (if AIM-7s are the same type).
The PACS will initialize a mixed AIM-7/AIM-120 load with AIM-120s in
priority. The launch sequence for a mixed load of MRMs is AIM-120,
AIM-7MH, AIM-7M, and AIM-7F, regardless of which station the missiles
are loaded on. With a mixed load of MRMs, missile reject cycles from
AIM-120, to AIM-7MH, AIM-7M, AIM-7F, and back to AIM-120.

A/A JETTISON PROCEDURES

There are three ways to jettison A/A weapons from the F-15E: emergency
jettison, combat jettison, and selective jettison. The following discusses
each in greater detail.

Emergency Jettison

The emergency jettison button (Figure D-20) can be used to jettison the
contents of all carted CFT stations (including any AIM-7s/AIM-120s) and
all pylons (including any AIM-9s/AIM-120s loaded) on stations 2 and 8.
The button is “hot” anytime the aircraft is on internal or external power,
and must be held in for approximately 1 second to complete a full load,
unarmed, jettison sequence.

WARNING

Aircrews should exercise extreme caution
to prevent an inadvertent ground-level
jettison of all aircraft stores. Although
the emergency jettison button is
spring-loaded to the normal position (only
black seen on the inside lip of the button
guard), it can stick in the jettison/
depressed position. This will be indicated
by observing yellow inside the switch
guard below the black.

Programming Combat Jettison

Combat jettison gives you the capability to jettison preprogrammed
aircraft stores in a combat situation. Programming is accomplished in
accordance with the procedures in Figure D-21. This mode is “hot”
whenever the landing gear handle is up or the armament safety switch is
in override. From Figure D-21, note that CFT (or fuselage) loaded MRMs
cannot be jettisoned using CBT JETT. Pylon mounted AIM-9s/AIM-120s
can be jettisoned only by jettisoning the pylon. Reference warning below,
cycling the combat jettison knob off and back to COMBAT will not reset
the program to CBT 1.

WARNINGS

Each selection of the CBT JETT display
reinitializes the two-push sequence and
resets the first push of the selective
jettison button to the CBT 1 program,
even if the CBT 1 programmed racks,
stores, or pylons have already been
jettisoned.

The combat jettison program is displayed
in TRNG and is reprogrammable for the
TRNG mode display. However, when
CBT JETT is performed, the system exits
TRNG mode and jettisons actual stores
and pylons loaded and programmed in the
CMBT mode.

System Failures

CC Failure

CC failure results in the loss of the PACS display format and many PACS
capabilities. However, with a CC failure the PACS defaults to an A/A
mode with the following operable functions/capabilities:

Master arm

FCP weapons release (pickle) button

AIM-120 no capability, missile will hang
AIM-7 no weapons parameters or shoot cue
AIM-9 boresight or uncaged, self-tracking shot

M61A1 GUN fires normally, but you cannot select firing rate or set
rounds count

Air-to-air and air-to-ground selective jettison (but no CBT JETT)

Emergency jettison

WARNING

Selecting MAN FF or RET puts the PACS
in the A/G mode and pressing the FCP or
RCP pickle button will release A/G stores
only.

Corrective Action

Attempt to reset the CC in accordance with Dash 1 checklist procedures.
If this does not fix the problem, adjust the mission to compensate or abort.

D-37 AAW-1


Text from AAW-1_Air-to-Air_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_44.jpeg:
PACS Failure

In addition to the degraded PACS capability with CC failure, the PACS
can also fail on its own. PACS processor failure is indicated by the
following:

e = Little ordnance related data available on the HUD and none on the
A/A radar. (CC relies on PACS processor for weapons data.)

@e Unable to get ARMT (PACS) display on any MPD/MPCD.
e AIM-120s, AIM-7s, and AIM-9s cannot be launched.

e M61A1 GUN operates normally, but the rounds count and firing rate
cannot be set or monitored.

e Jettison - only the emergency jettison option is available to jettison
ordnance.

Corrective Action

Cycling the PACS switch on the ground power panel to OFF and back to
AUTO may fix the problem. If not, adjust the mission to compensate or
abort.

Master Arm Switch Failure

If the HUD gun cross remains visible after selecting master arm SAFE,
the weapons release button and trigger circuits are armed.

Corrective Action

Select GUN on the weapon select switch. This inhibits MRM/SRM launch
and inhibits an A/G weapons release program. However, the gun fire
circuit remains hot, so the trigger must be avoided. When the landing
gear handle is placed down, the gun cross should be removed.

The WSO may deactivate the gun trigger and master arm logic by pulling

circuit breakers J3 (trigger) and/or K3 (master arm) on the right aft circuit
breaker panel.

INTRODUCTION

The programmable armament control system (PACS) provides the
capability for load, release programming, arming, monitoring,
releasing/firing and jettison of air-to-surface and air-to-air munitions. The
system is made up of computers and processors (CC, MPDP, PACS),
wiring, displays, controls, and carriage stations. It is software
programmable which allows for easy updating and has an extensive
built-in test (BIT) feature which isolates faults down to the specific
module for simplified, rapid repair. This lesson addresses the cockpit
components: the PACS display and the armament controls. Information
presented is primarily about air-to-air. Air-to-ground and nuclear
operations are covered in separate lessons.

To understand the PACS display, it is necessary to know the designations
for the munitions carriage locations. As on all aircraft, the F-15E
weapons stations are numbered left to right (Figure D-1). There is also a
detailed side view of the left CFT weapon stations (Figure D-2).

Figure D - 2. Left CFT Stations.

Here are a few generalizations of what can go where. Wing stations 2 and
8 can carry wing tanks, air-to-ground or air-to-air munitions or a
combination of each. When referencing air-to-air missiles on stations 2 or
8, A and B are used to depict the location. A is the left rail on the station
and B is the right rail on that station. Station 5 is authorized to carry
only air-to-surface munitions, AN/ALQ-14 (data link pod), and fuel tanks.
CFT missile stations are for medium range missiles; if missiles are loaded
on a CFT, the six tangential stations on that CFT cannot be used for A/G
munitions. CFT stations designated “LC” and “RC” on the PACS display
refer to all the CFT stations capable of carrying A/G munitions. When a
CFT is loaded with any A/G munitions, missile carriage on that CFT is
precluded. Refer to TO 1F-15E-1, Chapter 5 for current limitations on
carriage and combinations of weapons loads on the aircraft.

waterline symbol and points to the limited TD box. The off-boresight
angle is displayed next to the limited TD box, and represents the target
angle off boresight in degrees (Figure D-3). (In this and remaining

As you close, the ASE circle increases in size. Placing the steering dot on

Where you put the dot is where the target will be in the HUD (Figure
D-5).

Radar AUTO Acquisition

As you have previously learned in RDR-3, the selection of a particular
radar auto acq mode depends on the situation encountered. The auto
acquisition scan pattern (except for GUNS) selected is graphically
presented in the HUD. The HUD auto acquisition displays assist the pilot
in maintaining the target within the radar scan until radar lock on. Once
lock on occurs, regardless of the method with which lock on was achieved,
the track display presented on the HUD (and radar display) is a function
of the weapon select switch position (FCP, right throttle).

HUD WEAPONS DISPLAYS & STEERING

AIM-7

Representative AIM-7 attack mode displays are shown in Figures D-6 and
D-7. For these displays, symbols reject has been selected and the master
arm switch is in ARM (gun cross displayed 2° above the waterline). When
radar lock on occurs, the 12° MRM reference circle is removed, and the
ASE circle, steering dot and TD box appear on the HUD.

Figure D-6 shows two AIM-7 MRMs available with a 7M in priority. The
uppermost number on the range scale is the selected radar range. Vc
(closure velocity) is left of the caret. The caret position on the range scale
is PDT range. Priority missile launch range boundary data is displayed
on the range scale. The data block in the lower right corner of the HUD
contains the following information (in order):

Target (PDT) altitude is presented in thousands and hundreds of
feet (16-2 = 16,200 feet). Aspect angle is presented in degrees L/R
(15L=150° left).

Radar cues (JAM = Jamming present).

PDT radar range (R 11.3) is presented digitally.

Priority missile (under the pickle button) time of flight (TOF) to the
PDT (T12 sec = AIM-7 TOF is 12 seconds) is displayed when PDT
range is between Raero (current) and Rmin.

In-flight missile time information showing minimum/maximum
times to impact (TTD if more than 1 missile is in flight. T2/T10 sec
equals 2 sec and 10 sec until impact for previously fired AIM-7

Should the radar experience a signal loss during track, the track memory
and reacquisition logic is activated. The MEM cue appears on the HUD
and the TD box flashes (MEM also appears on the radar display) while the
radar extrapolates the last known target position and velocity. When
signal loss/degradation is due to ECM devices, the jam code (AOJ, HOJ,
JAM) overrides all other displays in this window.

If a valid signal return is received during this sequence, the radar
reenters normal track. If not, the radar returns to search. If radar track
is lost after missile launch (or if the target moves beyond the missile
limit), LSG (Losing) is displayed in place of missile TOF.

Text from AAW-2_HUD_Air-to-Air_Displays_page_16.jpeg:
AIM-120

The HUD (and radar display) AIM-120 presentations are determined by
the radar mode of operation. The launch modes are visual and radar
track.

Visual

This mode is used for visual range engagements. If, for instance, an
AIM-7 is in flight, with another one under the pickle button, the pilot can
thumb forward on the boat switch (missile reject) until an AIM-120 is in
priority. Holding the coolie switch down informs the missile that it is
being launched against a boresighted target (i.e., within the 12° reference
circle) with range and velocity unknown. No data link is provided to the
missile. Care should be used when launching an AIM-120 in the visual
mode since any close range aircraft along the missile boresight is a
potential target.

Radar

Figure D-8 shows four AIM-120s available with an AIM-120A in priority.
If two AIM-120As and two AIM-7Ms are carried, A2A is displayed when
an AIM-120A is in priority and M2M when an AIM-7M is in priority. The
dashed ASE circle replaces the AIM-7 solid ASE circle and mirrors the
radar display. AIM-120 shoot cue (and the lock/shoot light) criteria and
display logic parallels AIM-7 logic. The CC will generate an AIM-120
shoot cue with the radar in STT or DTWS, assuming all other
preconditions have been satisfied.

Next to the MRM inventory (Figure D-8) is the target size/RCS (radar
cross section) settings as programmed in the PACS for MRM missiles.
Refer to 1F-15E-34-1-1 and 1F-15E-34-1-1-1 for more details about target
size/RCS settings. The off missile cue has display priority over the target
size/RCS settings.

The data block below the radar range scale reflects AIM-120 information
similar to the AIM-7 display. If target range is within the computed
Raero (current) and Rmin, prelaunch time to active (TTA) appears on the
HUD in place of missile TOF. If range to target is less than active range,
the time displayed is time-to-impact (TTI) and is prefixed with an “H” if
the missile will launch and immediately go to HPRF active, and with an
“M” it will go MPRF active. At launch, MRM quantity changes, and the
TTA begins countdown on the next lower line on the HUD. If more than
one missile is launched, the TTA cue reflects the minimum/maximum
TTA/TTI of any missile(s) in flight. (Post launch TTA/TTI is added to the
radar display.) Off missile cue logic is the same as for the AIM-7.

When the last MRM has been launched, the MRM count goes to zero to
indicate no missile available. The ASE circle is removed, and only the
steering dot (based on MRM computations) is displayed. The shoot cue is
also removed (Figure D-9).

Radar in Track

After radar lock on, the FOV circle is replaced by an ASE circle and
steering dot. The AIM-9M ASE circle size is constant regardless of SCAN
selection. Centering the dot provides pure pursuit steering. When range
is greater than 12,000 feet, an aspect line (stick) is present on the ASE
circle. When target range decreases to 12,000 feet or less, a circular range
bar appears inside the ASE circle. Range is read on the bar according to
clock position (7 o’clock equals 7000 feet range). Rmin LC and Rmin HC
bars reflect Rmin for the missile and repeat the Rmin LC and Rmin HC
displayed on the radar range scale.

The AIM-9M seeker in priority is slaved to the radar LOS. Thus the
seeker head position circle and TD box are coincident (Figure D-12).
There may be transient periods in which the two LOSs are not coincident,
particularly during high-G maneuvers.

When the radar is supporting an AIM-7/AIM-120 in flight, the pilot can
boresight the AIM-9M if desired to engage a visual target. If boresighted,
the AIM-9M ASE circle (replaced by FOV circle) and steering dot are
removed, and the shoot cue is not displayed (Figure D-14).

If the SRM is already in self track, you must first cage the seeker to the
radar LOS (via the NGS button), then move the coolie switch down and
hold to boresight the missile. If the coolie switch is released before the
missile is uncaged (self track), the seeker returns to the radar LOS (TD
box).

GUN-A/A DISPLAYS

Figures D-16 through D-19 present the four possible HUD displays that
you will see when selecting GUN on the weapon select switch. The
displays are lead computing optical sight (LCOS) search funnel, LCOS
track funnel, gun director sight (GDS), and GDS funnel. Radar track and
funnel selection status impact which display will be seen.

Air-to-air gun employment and the combined SRM/Gun displays will be
covered in the gun lecture (AAW-6).

Symbols unique to the GUN attack HUD are the funnel, reticles, rounds
at target range (RATR) cue, bullet maximum range (BMR) cue and rounds
remaining numerics. The gun cross is present in the HUD with the
master arm switch in ARM.

LCOS Search Funnel

Figure D-16 shows the LCOS search funnel gun aiming display. This
display is in the HUD when GUN is selected on the weapon select switch
and the radar is in search. The funnel is used to help align in plane with
the target to achieve a stable tracking state.

The three pippers (2-mil circles) are located at pseudo target ranges of
1000, 2250, and 4000 feet (with PGU-28 in PACS). The width of the
funnel at each range is determined by the apparent size of a 40-foot
wingspan aircraft located at that range (stadiametric ranging). Ifthe
target aircraft is tracked in the funnel with one of the pippers on the
target, and if the target is visually judged to be at the pipper defined
range, then the bullets should pass through the target.

The RATR cue is present to show the location of your bullets arriving at a
pseudo target range of 2250 feet (1000 feet if in stiffen). The RATR is
present from arrival of the first bullet until arrival of the last bullet in the
fired stream of bullets.

The numerical rounds display indicates the approximate number of
bullets on board as programmed in the PACS and not yet expended.
During gun fire, the HUD (and PACS) count of rounds remaining
decreases ten at a time (i.e., 220...210...200... etc.). The last number in the
rounds remaining count in the HUD will be a “T” if the PACS is in the A/A
or A/G TRNG mode (i.e. 51T). When all rounds have been expended, the
rounds remaining count will show XXX (or XXT when in training PACS).

situation, the bullets should arrive at the target one time of flight after
trigger squeeze.

The range bar is provided to show radar derived range in an analog “clock

The 2-mil pipper/50-mil reticle/turn plane line are dynamically positioned
based on ownship maneuvering and target range/range rate/maneuvering
data. Ifthe pipper is on the target at trigger squeeze, bullets should hit
the target.

The radar range analog bar and RATR work as previously described. The
range bar has a leading edge tab.

The BMR cue is a dot positioned at the perimeter of the 50-mil reticle to
indicate maximum effective bullet range based on type of rounds loaded in
the PACS and ownship/target maneuvering and relationship. Like the
range bar, a BMR dot at 3 o’clock would indicate a maximum effective
bullet range of 3000 feet, 4 o’clock, 4000 feet, etc.

The BMR cue indicates the range that corresponds to a bullet TOF of 1.5
seconds for the M-56 bullet or 2.5 seconds for the PGU-28 bullet, or an
impact velocity of 500 FPS, whichever produces the shortest range.
Maximum accurate firing range is attained when the range bar tab is
equal to the maximum range cue.

The TD box is removed when its center is within 25 mils of the pipper, and
target range is less than 3000 feet (or the maximum bullet range,
whichever is greater). It reappears when range increases to 3200 feet (or
200 feet greater than maximum bullet range), or when the center of the
box is more than 37 mils from the pipper.

SYSTEM DEGRADES
CC Failure

All MRM and SRM computer generated attack steering display data is
lost if CC failure occurs. A shoot cue is not provided, and launch
envelopes must be estimated. The fixed MRM 12° reference circle is
continuously displayed, and provides a visual aiming symbol for a missile
fired without radar lock on. STT is available on the radar. If an AIM-7 is
launched in STT, HPRF illumination is provided for 120 seconds. The
AIM-120 can not be fired.

The AIM-9M seeker head reference circle is not displayed, and the
missiles are boresighted to 0° azimuth and 46 mils below the gun cross.
The seeker heads will not slave to the radar. The waterline can be used as
an aiming reference. When the missile in priority is uncaged, no cues will
appear in the HUD to show uncaged and track status.

The gun cross is continuously displayed, and becomes the sole aiming
reference for gun shots.

PACS Failure

The CC relies on inputs from the PACS for computation and display of
specific weapons aiming information. This includes the ASE circle and
steering dot, launch range boundary data, missile and bullet inventories,
etc. Therefore, with PACS failure, all ordnance-related HUD data is
absent.

INS Failure

INS failure should not cause any degradation of HUD weapons displays
other than a flashing velocity vector, as the AHRS provides automatic
backup of INS attitude inputs. However, the unlikely failure of both
systems could be mistaken for selection of symbols reject on the HUD. In
either case (symbols reject or attitude failure), the heading and bank
scales and pitch ladder are removed. Keep in mind, though, there will be
many additional indicators of complete attitude failure.

MPDP Failure

Failure of the MPDP results in loss of the HUD.

TEXT

The HUD is the primary reference in the visual, dogfight environment. In
conjunction with the FCP stick grip and throttle controls, the HUD affords
the distinct advantage of in-close radar acquisition and A/A weapons
employment without looking inside the cockpit.

Although an indispensable tactical tool, there can be drawbacks to this
“single-source” attack, navigation and attitude display. One potential
danger is pilot fixation on attack symbology to the exclusion of other
environmental cues like flight path convergence with terrain, the target
aircraft, etc. Channelizing attention on the HUD at the expense of a
disciplined crosscheck is too often a fatal error.

The HUD display is limited in A/A information when the NAV or INST
master mode is selected. The TD box is the only A/A type symbology in
the normal NAV or INST HUD displays. Target and missile information
is not available except on the radar display. These master modes are not
recommended for A/A employment.

A/A information is not available in the A/G master mode except on the A/A
radar display.

HUD DISPLAYS-A/A MASTER MODE
A/A Master Mode Selection

The HUD displays are governed by the selected master mode. HUD
air-to-air weapons displays are only available in the A/A master mode.
Depressing the A/A master mode button, moving the FCP castle switch
forward (if not in A/A), or selecting GUN with the weapon select switch,
immediately selects the A/A master mode. Subsequent forward movement
of the FCP castle switch will toggle between A/A and A/G master modes.
While in the A/A master mode, the HUD attack displays are then
determined by the weapon select switch position (AFT/CTR/FWD).

HEI / HEI-T (Tracer)

The M56 high-explosive incendiary (HEI) cartridge (Figure D-2) is used
against aircraft and light material targets. The projectile functions with a
combined detonation and incendiary effect after target impact. The fuze
features a mechanical point detonating system protected by an aluminum
cover that crushes on impact. When fired, both acceleration and friction
forces on the ball rotor and the c-ring prevent any detonator-in-line
movement until muzzle exit. When acceleration decreases and projectile
spin rate exceeds 49,800 rpm, the locking c-ring opens due to centrifugal
force. This allows the detonator to align with the firing pin and booster
charge. Arming is complete 20 to 35 feet in front of the aircraft. The
length of the explosive train creates a 300 millisecond explosion delay at
impact. This delay allows four to six inches of penetration of a truck-type
target.

PGU-27/B Target Practice (TP)

The PGU-27/B TP cartridge replaces the M55 cartridge. The PGU-27/B is
an inert projectile with a steel body and a solid aluminum alloy nose as
shown in Figure D-8. The cartridge uses the same case primer and a
slightly modified WC872 ball propellant, designated the WC867. The
total cartridge length remains unchanged; therefore, no changes to the
gun or ammunition handling and storage equipment are required (versus
the M55 cartridge). Due to the improvements in aerodynamic shape, drag
has been reduced approximately 33%, velocity is increased by 36% at 1000
meters and time-of-flight (TOF) is decreased by 39% at 1000 meters.

PGU-28/B Semi-Armor Piercing High Explosive Incendiary (SAPHEI)

The PGU-28/B (Figure D-4) projectile replaces the M56 HEI projectile.
The body of the PGU-28/B is machined from 15B27 steel bar stock and
then hardened to improve performance against lightly armored targets
such as APCs and armored helicopters. Projectile components consist of
two incendiary compounds, a high explosive, a zirconium pellet, a copper
rotating band, and aluminum nose and support disk. The Type I nose
incendiary is ignited by the mechanical shock of impact. The nose
incendiary reaction ignites the more energetic Type II body incendiary,
which in turn initiates the high explosive. The burning of the pyrotechnic
material produces a delay, allowing the projectile to penetrate into the
target before detonating. The high explosive reaction splinters the
hardened steel body of the projectile and ignites the zirconium pellet
providing a long, persistent spark for improved fire start capability.

Ammunition Container

The ammunition container is mounted in the center of the aircraft
fuselage. It stores 485 rounds of ammunition, transfers them to the
conveyor, receives spent casings and unfired rounds from the conveyor,
and puts them back in storage (Figure D-5).

Conveyor

The conveyor transfers rounds to the feeder. It also accepts spent cases
and unfired rounds from the unload drive assembly, and returns them to
the container. The conveyor holds 69 rounds for a total system capacity of
504 rounds.

Gearbox and Power Supply

The gearbox uses hydraulic power to turn the conveyor assembly. It also
powers the unload drive assembly through a drive shaft. The power
supply (driven by Utility B) is mounted on the gearbox, and can provide
up to a 6000 round per minute firing rate. It also performs a braking
function during gun deceleration. The gun spin up time is .4 seconds.

Firing Cycle

If the gun is externally preflighted to be hot, the landing gear handle is
up, the master arm switch is in arm and the PACS is not in a training
mode, then the gun will fire when the trigger is squeezed to the second

detent.
CAUTION

The weapon select switch (FCP) does not
have to be in GUN to fire the gun.

Rounds are picked up by bolts in the main cam path. As the bolts slide
forward in the firing cam they chamber the round. The bolt is locked into
place and firing voltage is applied. After firing, the bolt is unlocked and
extracts the round from the chamber. After extraction, the round is
ejected into the unload drive assembly.

Clearing Cycle

When the pilot releases the trigger, round fire and counting voltage are
maintained until hydraulic braking action decelerates the gun. The delay
between trigger release and the point at which incoming rounds are no
longer chambered and fired is such that five to eleven rounds fire after
trigger release. As the gun decelerates through 3900 +150 rounds per
minute, all six bolt assemblies are locked in the cleared position. The time
period between the last round fired and complete gun stop results in six to
nine live rounds clearing the gun and returning to the ammunition
container assembly. Total time from trigger release to gun full stop is
slightly under one second.

Text from AAW-6_Gun_page_16.jpeg:
If set to RDS LIMIT with a limiter count of 799 or less (2 in Figure D-6),
the rounds limit switch (3 in Figure D-6) controls the number of rounds
fired by the gun on any one sortie. When the preset amount has been
processed, the rounds limiter signals the PACS to start the clearing cycle,
and gun motor shutdown. If the gun is at full firing speed, up to

20 rounds in excess of the number set in the limit counter may be
processed. The gun is hydraulically safe after limiter shutdown since the
limit count will then be in the range of 979-999.

At gun motor shutdown, the HUD rounds count displays XXX to indicate
that the LIMIT (or total) rounds have been expended. In RDS LIMIT
(with a limiter count of 800-999), the gun is hydraulically safe. If the
switch is in NO LIMIT, only the electrical safing pin and cam holdback
tool/download pin prevent electrical firing pulses and rounds being
chambered when the trigger is squeezed.

Hydraulic Manual Control Handle

Checking that the handle (4 in Figure D-6) is in the stowed (flush) position
ensures the gun hydraulic motor is not in a load mode, but is ready for
firing.

Type Ammo

The type of ammo loaded (5 in Figure D-6) may be observed at the load
gate. The type and quantity of ammo loaded will be listed in the AFTO
Form 781A. AFTO Form 781H (block 11) should be checked first to find
the correct page and block reference to look at in the 781A.

Load Gate Tangs/Cartridge Guide Tangs

The load gate tang and cartridge guide tangs (6 in Figure D-6) should be
properly positioned. These tangs are separated during the gun loading
process. After loading, the tangs are positioned back together (tips-to-
tips). The tangs form the ammo pathway to the gun and therefore should
be positioned together properly so as to provide a smooth sliding surface
where the ammo passes.

GUNSIGHT MODES

The gunsight has two operating modes: the gun director sight (GDS) mode
and funnel (FNL) mode. The director mode provides the pilot with an
accurate, all-aspect gunsight. The FNL mode (with certain limitations)
provides an accurate backup gunsight by allowing the pilot to compare
target wingspan to the funnel width. The primary benefit of the funnel is
that it allows the pilot to estimate target range by comparing wingspan to
funnel width to achieve a best guess firing solution with no radar track.

NOTE

In this lesson, radar tracking is when the radar is in single target

track. Gun tracking is target tracking by the pilot using HUD
aiming symbology.

GDS Mode

The director mode provides the pilot with an accurate all-aspect gunsight
that eliminates the requirement to obtain steady-state tracking condition.
The director reticle is displayed only after final radar track with JEM
resolved, a 1.5 second settling time delay, and valid data available for use
in the solution. CC director mode computations take into account target
velocities, accelerations and estimated future target position. CC
computations also include compensation for both bullet trajectory and
target dynamics during the bullet's time of flight. Due to computational
“smoothing,” the sight lags somewhat following heavy target
maneuvering. With that one exception, coincidence of the reticle and
target represent a correct aiming solution for the pilot.

One advantage of the director mode is the elimination of the necessity to
fire early in anticipation of bullet TOF. A second advantage is that the
director gunsight does not require steady state pipper-on-target tracking
for accurate reticle aiming. However, the probability of achieving hits is
greatly improved with a short bullet TOF and low target relative LOS
rates.

AAW-6 D-16


Text from AAW-6_Gun_page_23.jpeg:
These advantages are a result of the director mode software (GDS
algorithm). The software uses radar tracking data in its lead angle
computations. The lead angle computations are independent of F-15E
maneuvering and accelerations. Thus, firing solutions are obtained
quickly, and rapid attitude changes have little short term effect on the
required lead angle.

The director gunsight does not dampen reticle motion caused by F-15E
maneuvering. Motion of the director reticle caused by variations in F-15E
acceleration is a true representation of bullet stream dynamics. Selecting
stiffen with GDS or GDS funnel selected reverts the gunsight to a LCOS
track funnel display with a tracking LCOS reticle at the radar target
range. If either range or range rate is not available, 1000 feet and/or -50
FPS respectively is used to display the LCOS reticle. When stiffen is
released, the previously selected gunsight returns.

Funnel (FNL) Mode

The funnel is a reference target system. It was designed on the premise
that the F-15E could out turn its opponents to saddle up and track. It
assumes that the F-15E is in the target’s plane of motion (POM), with

45° or less angle off. It also assumes F-15E and target G are the same.
The sight shows where bullets will be one TOF from trigger squeeze, if the
parameters remain constant.

The funnel is calculated using the lead computing optical sight (LCOS)
algorithm and only own ship data with the one exception that radar range
and/or range rate are used when available. The funnel is computed based
on the assumption that the target is performing the same maneuvers as
the F-15E shooter, thus the funnel responds to changes in F-15E
acceleration. The appearance and accuracy of the funnel is determined by
the availability and quantity of radar data.

D-17 AAW-6


Text from AAW-6_Gun_page_24.jpeg:
The center of the funnel corresponds to pseudo LCOS reticles with the
width of the funnel equating to a 40-foot wingspan target at seven
computed ranges (750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 2250, 4000 and 5000 feet). The
points are joined together to form the funnel. The end of the funnel is
limited to bullet maximum range when less than 5000 feet. With no radar
track, three 2-mil pippers are displayed in the middle of the funnel at
ranges of 1000, 2250 and 4000 feet with PGU-28 bullets. With M56
bullets loaded only 1000 and 2250-foot pippers are displayed.

The pilot must fly to put the target within the funnel at the appropriate
range to achieve bullet solution. Target range can be estimated using the
funnel width corresponding to a 40-foot wingspan target. The funnel may
be used as either a tracking reference or a dampened bullet position
indicator. As a tracking sight, the pilot must achieve a position that
allows the appropriate section of the funnel to be stabilized on the target
when the gun is fired. G must be held constant to achieve a stable sight
picture for a tracking gun shot.

If a stable tracking position is not viable while in the FNL mode, the
funnel can be considered a dampened bullet position indicator. The
aircraft should be flown so that the target and funnel (at the correct target
range) are moving toward a common intercept point. The pilot fires when
the funnel center is judged to be displaced approximately one TOF plus
gun spin up time from intercept. If parameters are held constant, bullet
position will be coincidental with the funnel center. The pilot must
anticipate such that the bullets will be in the proper funnel position/range
when it intercepts the target.

LCOS Search Funnel

Figure D-11 shows the LCOS search funnel gun aiming display. This
display is in the HUD when GUN is selected on the weapon select switch
and the radar is in search. This is the only available gun display without
a radar lock-on. The funnel is used to help align in plane with the target
to achieve a stable tracking state.

The funnel is simulating the bullet stream flowing away from the F-15E.
The top of the funnel is for closer ranges, the bottom end of the funnel is
for maximum ranges. The funnel is very dynamic during maneuvering as
is the bullet stream.

Text from AAW-6_Gun_page_27.jpeg:
The three pippers (2-mil circles) are located at set ranges of 1000, 2250
and 4000 feet aiming ranges. The width of the funnel at each range is
determined by the apparent width of a 40-foot wingspan aircraft located
at that range (a form of stadiametric ranging). If the target aircraft is
tracked in the funnel with one of the pippers on the target and if the
target is visually judged to be at the set range defining that pipper, then
the bullets should pass through the target.

The rounds at target range (RATR) cue (inverted triangle) displays the
location of your bullets arriving at a pseudo target range of 2250 feet. For
displays with radar lock-on, the RATR will indicate the location of bullets
at radar target range. The RATR is displayed from arrival of the first
bullet until arrival of the last bullet in the fired stream of bullets. It takes
into account bullet ballistics, atmospheric data and F-15E maneuvering.
The RATR should not be used as an aiming device. The RATR is not HUD
limited; it will not be displayed when the computed position is outside the
HUD FOV.

The rounds remaining display indicates the approximate number of
bullets on board as loaded in the PACS and not yet expended. During gun
fire, the HUD (and PACS) count of rounds remaining decreases ten at a
time (i.e., 500...490...480, etc.).

LCOS Track Funnel

The LCOS track funnel display (Figure D-12) provides additional
symbology/data when compared to the search funnel display. The
additional symbols/data are derived from radar track information. The
LCOS track funnel is presented until final stable radar single target track

The reticle (2-mil pipper and 25-mil segmented circle) is positioned down
the center locus of the funnel based on target range/range rate and own
ship maneuvering parameters. If target range is not valid, 2250 feet (or
1000 feet stiffened) is used, and 50 FPS is used if range rate is not valid.
The funnel is also moving based on the same data. If the pipper is held on
the target in a stable tracking situation, the bullets should arrive at the
target one time of flight after trigger squeeze.

If reticle stiffen is selected while in GDS or GDS FNL, the LCOS track
funnel will be displayed while the FCP coolie switch is held down. The
range bar is provided to show radar derived range in an analog “clock
type” format. The bar starts at twelve o’clock and moves clockwise. The
leading edge of the bar shows range by clock position in thousands of feet
(e.g., 3 o'clock is 3000 feet range).

trigger squeeze, bullets should hit the target if within bullet effective
range.

The turn plane line (GDS only) represents the CC computed projection of
the target’s plane of motion (POM). It can be used as an aid to achieving
an in-plane solution during high aspect gun attacks. The line is drawn
from the gun cross, through the reticle, to the edge of the HUD.

Text from AAW-6_Gun_page_30.jpeg:
The radar range analog bar and RATR work as previously described.
RATR, in this case, would be for rounds arriving at the radar derived
target range.

The BMR cue is a dot dynamically positioned at the perimeter of the
50-mil reticle to indicate maximum effective bullet range based on type of
rounds loaded in the PACS and own ship/target maneuvering and
relationship. Like the range bar, a BMR dot at 3 o’clock would indicate a
maximum effective bullet range of 3000 feet, 4 o’clock, 4000 feet, etc.
Under certain engagement conditions, the bullet maximum range may
exceed 12,000 feet. In this case, the maximum range cue is limited to the
12 o'clock position.

The BMR cue indicates the range that corresponds to a bullet TOF of 1.5
seconds for the M-56 bullet or 2.5 seconds for the PGU-28 bullet, or an
impact velocity of 500 FPS, whichever produces the shortest range.
Maximum accurate firing range is attained when the range bar tab
decreases to the BMR cue range or less.

The TD box is removed when its center is within 25 mils of the pipper, and
target range is less than 3000 feet (or the maximum bullet range,
whichever is greater). It reappears when range increases to 3200 feet or
200 feet greater than maximum bullet range, or when the center of the
box is more than 37 mils from the pipper.

GUN EMPLOYMENT

Select HIGH rate for greater bullet stream density and higher Px. At 100
rounds per second, this gives you roughly 5 seconds of continuous gun fire
time. In air-to-air combat, fire significant bursts (1-2 seconds) to increase
bullet count near the target. Remember, the period between trigger
release and gun full stop is slightly less than 1 second. During the
clearing cycle, the trigger is disabled and you must delay at least this long
between bursts.

Often, the largest errors result from firing at near maximum range. Long
range shots increase bullet TOF. It is relatively simple for the target to
change his POM, thereby flying himself away from the bullet stream.

Increased muzzle velocity and lower drag of the PGU-28 bullet increases
the bullet's effective range and maximum TOF. During A/A gunnery with
the PGU-28 bullet, the pilot will notice an increased maximum firing
range and a decreased lead angle requirement for a given target range
(over the M-56).

Tracking Gun Shot-LCOS Search Display

With no radar lock-on, the LCOS search display (Figure D-15) may still be
used for a tracking shot if the pilot accurately estimates target range. The
width of the funnel may be used as an aid in estimating target range. The
funnel width at any given position equates to a target computation range
based on the apparent width of a 40-foot wingspan aircraft at that position
and computation range. If the pilot positions the 40-foot wingspan target
in the funnel at a position where the wingspan subtends the width of the
funnel (wall-to-wall), then the bullet stream should pass through the
target position as the stream moves away from the F-15E. Adjustments
in aiming with the funnel must be made when the wingspan is not 40 feet.

AAW-06-15

Figure D - 15. LCOS Search Display.

One way to approach the shot with the funnel is to pull the target from
the top of the funnel downward through the funnel until wingspan/funnel
width match occurs. Another way would be to place your nose well in lead
of the target and control the target movement into position from the
bottom of the funnel. This then has the target at the funnel calculated
range and position of the bullet stream. Firing should commence one
bullet TOF prior to arrival of the funnel/wingspan match, especially if the
target cannot be stabilized in a tracking position.

The three small pippers are for 1000, 2250 and 4000 feet calculated bullet
stream ranges. The RATR is calculated for a target range of 2250 feet
(1000 feet if stiffened) in this display.

D-27 AAW-6


Text from AAW-6_Gun_page_34.jpeg:
Tracking Gun Shot-LCOS Track Display

With a radar lock-on, the LCOS pipper can be used as a tracking index
with good results if employed in the envelope it was designed for (aspect
45° or less/30 knots in closure/in target POM/G held constant, Figure
D-16). The funnel helps align the shot, but ultimately the pilot should
track the target with the pipper. If the pipper is on the target, the bullet
stream should pass through the target position. Since the pipper is being
positioned using radar range data, wingspan/funnel matching is not
required.

AAW-06-16

Figure D - 16. LCOS Track Display.

Realize though, that pipper on the target is not always an indicator of
bullets on the target. In a high aspect/closure situation the sight can
under lead enough to cause a miss (up to 50 mils at 90° aspect). If the
target is moving out-of-plane, then the pipper will be in lag until shooter
parameters stabilize and the sight “settles.” If G is increased to bring the
pipper to the target, the pipper depresses to indicate a need for more lead.
If you add more G to bring the pipper on target and fire at the same time,
the results after one TOF will be bullets behind the target.

AAW-6 D - 28


Text from AAW-6_Gun_page_35.jpeg:
Tracking Gun Shot-GDS Display

The GDS pipper (Figure D-17) is very accurate and should be placed on
the target prior to trigger squeeze. Tracking the target for an extended
time (prior to trigger squeeze) is not required. Firing should occur inside
BMR cue range.

squeeze. Again, extended tracking time is not required.

Text from AAW-6_Gun_page_37.jpeg:
Tracking Gun Shot-—GDS and GDS FNL Displays

Whether to take a tracking shot or snap shot depends on several factors.
These factors include energy state, threat environment, maneuvering
requirements, timing, etc. Tracking shots have a high Pk, but are time
and energy consuming and make the F-15E predictable. Snap shots
deplete less energy and allow for a quick separation if the attempt fails,
but they have a lower Pk. In either case, the shooter must recognize the
type of shot required and react quickly to optimize shot parameters.

The all aspect gun director sight takes approximately 1.5 seconds to
initialize following radar lock on (during that period the LCOS track
display is present). Pull enough lead to put the reticle ahead of the target
and use the turn plane line/funnel as an aid in establishing an in-plane
solution. The pipper should be allowed to move to the target at a
controllable rate. Begin firing when in range and maintain the pipper on
the target for as long as necessary. The RATR should appear and be
superimposed on the target one time of flight following trigger squeeze.

Snap Shot-GDS and GDS FNL Displays

The first priority is to establish adequate lead. More lead makes the
target closer at open fire range and decreases bullet TOF, but can limit
over-the-nose visibility. A slight out-of-plane pursuit course is acceptable
for maintaining tally. The turn plane line/funnel is an exceptional
reference for accomplishing both the slightly out of and in-plane
maneuvers. As range decreases and the target tracks forward, reposition
into his POM.

Your next concern is when to start firing on the bandit. An advantage of
the director mode is its direct indication of bullet miss distance. No sight
dampening is used and there is no inherent delay in miss distance
indications due to fighter maneuvering.

D-31 AAW-6


Text from AAW-6_Gun_page_38.jpeg:
Reticle lag due to fighter maneuvering is nonexistent in the director mode.
However, there is some lag associated with target maneuvering. The lag
occurs during target jinking and is a result of the radar tracking filters.
Normally, within 2 seconds of the target ceasing its maneuvers, 90% of
the target's maneuvering influences are eliminated (assuming no sight
stiffening). This means that during aggressive jinking the sight may lag
as much as 2 seconds behind. Consideration should be given to this factor
when setting up for director mode snap shots.

Snap Shot-LCOS Search and Track Funnel Displays

The snap shot in the LCOS mode is accomplished in the same manner as
that mentioned earlier. The open fire point is determined by the track
rate of the funnel match/pipper and the bandit toward each other. If
parameters are held constant, fire the gun one TOF prior to funnel
match/pipper and target intersection (Figure D-19).

AAW-06-19

Figure D - 19. Snap Shot.

If it is necessary to slow LOS rate by increasing G, the pipper will depress
toward the target and be out of solution. To compensate, open fire earlier
than one TOF before pipper/target intercept. Cease fire once the pipper
passes through the target. Shooting past this point wastes ammunition
and delays any reposition/separation maneuver.

Kill Criteria (See gun shot assessment on next page)

RATR frames required on target aircraft “
15 frames (8mm)/30 frames (VTR)[J1/2 second total “?”

Remarks

1. Assessment tables assume 30 frames per second (FPS) for 8mm VTR and 60 FPS
for 3/4-inch VTR.

The center of the RATR must be touching the target to count as a frame. Each
video frame with the entire RATR superimposed on the aircraft and the center of
the RATR on the fuselage will count as two frames.

No-lock shots outside 2500 ft are unassessable. No-lock shots taken between
2500 ft and 1500 ft (reticle nonstiffened) with 25 valid frames (50 VTR) on the
target are valid for a kill. No-lock shots taken between 1500 ft and 500 ft (with
the reticle stiffened) with 20 valid frames (40 VTR) on the target are valid for a
kill.

Gun attempt is any trigger squeeze.

Valid gun shot is any gun attempt resulting in any frames with the center of the
RATR on the target.

Invalid gun shot is any gun attempt not resulting in any frames with the center
of the RATR on the target due to shooter parameters (plane, range, lead, etc.).

Defeated gun shot is any gun attempt not resulting in any frames with the
center of the RATR on the target due to target maneuvers (jinks, out-of-plane
pulls, rolling breaks, etc.).

Text from AAW-6_Gun_page_40.jpeg:
Gun Shot Assessment

The following paragraphs explain the methodology used to convert the
Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) 20 round requirement into
RATR frames on target for both 3/4-inch and 8mm VTR.

Assumptions

The F-15 gun alone has a bullet dispersion of less than 4 mils. This
means that at 1000 ft, 80 percent of the bullets fired will pass through a 4-
foot cone. The published dispersion criteria for the gun system is 8 mils.
This criteria takes into account other factors, including boresight error,
radar track latency, radar scintillation and other specific aircraft factors.
In effect, this means that a 4-mil grouping of bullets may be randomly
located anywhere within a 8 mil cone. By defining a valid RATR frame as
any frame when the center of the RATR is touching the aircraft, at any
one time up to 50 percent of the RATR may be off the aircraft, resulting in
an average of 40 percent of the bullets fired hitting the aircraft.

3/4-VTR or 8mm Assessment

To satisfy the JMEM 20 bullet requirement using the assumptions listed
above and a gun fire rate of 100 rounds per second, the center of the RATR
must be on the target for 3/4 of a second (100 bullets per second x 40
percent bullets on aircraft x 0.75 seconds = 20 bullets on aircraft). This
equates to 30 frames using 60 frame per second (fps) (3/4-inch VTR) or 15
frames using 30 (8mm). Obviously, if the entire RATR was superimposed
on the aircraft, it would take less frames to satisfy the JMEM
requirements (1/4 of a second or 15 frames [3/4-inch VTR], eight frames
[8mm]) because the probability of the number of bullets going through the
aircraft is increased. To acknowledge this fact, any frame where the
entire RATR is superimposed on the aircraft and the center of the RATR is
on the fuselage counts as two frames. This in effect reduces the number of
frames required by 50 percent while ensuring the bullet density is
centered around critical components of the aircraft and factors in the
increased survivability of four-generation aircraft to PGU rounds going
through the wings.

FAILURES
Double Generator/Utility B Failure

Because the M61A1 is electrically controlled and hydraulically powered, a
double main generator or Utility B failure will disable the gun.

ADC/INS Failure

If inputs from either the ADC or INS become bad, the gunsight reverts to
the FNL backup mode. Total failure of the INS results in a fixed
depression gunsight. Mil depression angle must be entered in the UFC
and the sight becomes a fixed sight only.

PACS Failure

An armed gun will fire with the trigger. However, without the PACS, you
cannot change the firing rate or monitor and change the rounds count.
There will be no gun reticles on the HUD.

CC Failure
With CC failure, the gun cross is continuously displayed (if master arm

switch is in ARM), and becomes the sole aiming reference for gun shots
(Figure D-20).

COMBINED MODE
This mode allows a gunsight and gun to be used while a short range
missile (SRM) is selected. While in the combined mode, the A/A radar
display operates as ifin SRM. The gun mode symbology takes priority in
the HUD with some SRM information added. When the gun is fired, the
HUD reverts to primary gun mode symbology.
Combined Mode Entry
Combined mode is entered by selecting SRM on the weapon select switch
and then pulling up on the right multi-function (coolie) switch in the front
cockpit for more than 1 second. These requirements must be met:

e A/A master mode selected

e Pilot in command of the A/A radar

e SRM selected

e In any radar mode except TWS

e Bullets available for the gun
Exclusion of TWS assures there is not conflict with the coolie up selection.
Availability of SRMs is not a requirement to enter the combined mode.
While in the combined mode, up activation of the coolie switch for less
than 1 second cycles between GDS and GDS FNL availability.
Combined Mode Exit
Exit occurs when any of the following takes place:

¢ Coolie switch pulled up for longer than 1 second

e A/A master mode exited

e Weapon select switch is moved out of SRM

e Radar mode is changed to TWS

e The last bullet is fired and its time-of-flight has expired

e PACS to CC communication is lost

M61A1 GUN DESCRIPTION

The 20mm gun is an air cooled, six-barrel weapon capable of firing at
rates of 4000 or 6000 rounds per minute. The M61A1 has a rotary action
mechanism contained within a fixed rear housing assembly with six bolts,
a firing cam path, a clearing cam path and a rotating barrel cluster. The
gun is installed in the right wing root, and is canted up 2° from the
fuselage reference line (FRL). Dispersion is 8 mils.

The major components of the gun system are the gun, ammunition
container, conveyor assemblies, and the hydraulic power and gearbox
assemblies.

20MM INFORMATION/DESCRIPTION
20mm Ammunition

The components that make up a complete round are: a brass cartridge
case, an electric primer, propellant powder and the projectile (Figure D-1).
The projectile is fired when an electrical pulse is applied to the primer.
The resulting flame passes through a gas vent leading to the propellant
chamber and ignites the propellant. As the propellant burns, it forms a
gas that forces the projectile through the gun barrel. The muzzle velocity
for the M-56 bullet is 3300 FPS. The muzzle velocity for the PGU-28 is
3375 FPS.

The only significant difference between the types of ammunition is in the
projectile. Located at the rear of all projectiles is a band of soft metal that
sits in the grooves of the gun barrel. The grooves in the barrel are twisted
so that the projectile receives a rotating motion as it travels through and
leaves the gun barrel. This rotation is induced to provide stability in
flight and projectile arming (if appropriate). The soft band also serves to
prevent the propelling gas from escaping past the projectile.

hollow.

The M220 TP-T is the same round, but incorporates a tracer.

API

The M53 armor-piercing incendiary (API) is used against armored targets.
The projectile functions with a combined incendiary and penetration

effect. It is made of steel with an incendiary composition. The projectile
does not contain a fuze since the incendiary effect is initiated by impact.

NONE

There is no formal ACG phase review in the F-15E syllabus.
However, individual instructors are available to answer questions

and assist in reviewing ACG material. Please do not hesitate to ask
them for help.

Using the syllabus flowcharts and daily schedules as a guide, you should
always know what is coming next in this course. The major responsibility
for learning the material is yours. The instructors can assist; however,
you must do the learning. This is especially true in the avionics block
with most of the instruction being CBT lessons. Classroom, flight and
trainer time is limited; to get the most out of these devices, it is essential
that you complete all preparatory steps before going to the event.
Instructors will present material to you and field your questions. If you
are unsure of anything in this course, ASK!

F-15E ROLES AND CAPABILITIES

The F-15E is a high performance, supersonic, all-weather, dual role
fighter.

The air-to-ground (A/G) role tasking includes both conventional (general
purpose and precision guided munitions) and nuclear strike. The term
“all-weather” means the F-15E can penetrate and deliver ordnance in or
under the weather.

The air-to-air (A/A) role tasking may include self-escort and air base

defense. The design mission definitions specify relatively long station
times and excellent dash and turning capabilities.

ACG-1 D-4


Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_11.jpeg:
Configurations, Range, and Capabilities

The dual role mission requires superior payload/radius characteristics,
payload loading flexibility, high speed sea level penetration capability,
and superior combat maneuverability. The performance of the F-15E
provides over 1000 nm mission radius, a 600 KTAS penetration, 4 Gs
sustained maneuvering at MIL power and 6 Gs with afterburner.
Instantaneous evasive maneuvers up to 9 Gs at gross weights of 68,000
lbs are achievable at sea level.

In the A/G role, the payload/radius of the F-15E is enhanced by the
capability to carry up to 35,550 lbs of fuel and by the low drag associated
with the tangential carriage of weapons on the conformal fuel tanks
(CFTs). A mission radius of 680 nm is achievable with a payload of four
MK-84s and four AIM-120s (advanced medium range air-to-air missile or
AMRAAM) including a 100 nm sea level dash. At MIL thrust, it can
achieve sea level dash speeds of 590 KTAS without external tanks and
550 KTAS with tanks. Nuclear strike mission capability is almost 1100
nm (tanks dropped). The F-15E has 19 integral store stations, the
potential for 24,500 lbs of payload with full internal fuel, and eight
stations for A/A missiles. This provides the field commander the flexibility
to match payload and radius to the requirements no matter what the
theater of operation.

In the A/A role, the maneuvering performance is equal to that of the
F-15C at subsonic speeds and increased at supersonic speeds.
Instantaneous maneuvering is enhanced by increasing the design limit
load factor to 9 Gs. The A/A mission performance is substantial. For
theater air defense with a payload of eight missiles, the F-15E can loiter
on combat air patrol (CAP) for up to 3.7 hours at 200 nm from base. For
the area intercept mission, the radius with eight missiles is 967 nm.

In the ferry mission, the F-15E has sufficient range to deploy worldwide
without tanker support. Range with full external fuel and four AIM-120s
is approximately 2200 nm.

Design Philosophy

The F-15E is the product of a technically low risk attempt to satisfy a
USAF requirement for a survivable deep interdiction aircraft. The
rationale was to exploit capabilities already existing in the F-15 by
modifying them only to the extent needed to provide the ability to
penetrate and accurately deliver weapons in all weather, day or night.

D-5 ACG-1


Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_12.jpeg:
Relatively minor changes were required to the airframe and basic
systems. Substantial cockpit changes were required to fully exploit low
altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night (LANTIRN) and
decrease crew workload to the extent that the dual role could be
accomplished. Many of the “changes” in the F-15E were already approved
for the F-15A/C and reflect refinements of operational systems rather than
new developments.

The cockpits were designed to reduce and simplify crew tasks. Workload
is minimized by using multiple displays (multipurpose displays [MPDs],
and multipurpose color displays [MPCDs]) for simultaneous display of
sensor, weapon, and advisory data without requiring extended sequencing
through display selections. Color displays are provided for easier
interpretation of data. An integrated upfront control (UFC) is included in
each cockpit for operation of aircraft communications, navigation and
identification (CNI) systems. Hand controllers permit rapid changes of
mode, selection of display options and sensor/weapon management.
Display units are within easy reach and, along with other cockpit
instruments and caution/advisory indicators, are situated for easy
viewing.

Operation from any MPD/MPCD uses prompting menus for sensor modes,
submodes, and advisory formats. The cockpit controls, instrumentation
and displays are integrated to provide virtually unlimited flexibility in the
use of the systems.

Extreme cockpit flexibility requires extensive crew coordination. Crews
must have a plan to ensure everything gets done without duplicating
effort.

F-15E ENHANCEMENTS

LANTIRN

The LANTIRN system consists of two pods, which provide night,
all-weather low altitude navigation and precision targeting information.

The LANTIRN system provides the following capabilities:
e Terrain following radar (TFR)
e Forward looking infrared (FLIR)

e Day/Night target detection, identification and designation

ACG-1 D-6


Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_13.jpeg:
e Target acquisition and track
e Automatic target handoff to Maverick missiles

A radar altimeter is integrated into the system for both automatic terrain
following and hand flying operations.

F100-PW-220 Engine
The F-15E is powered by the F100-PW-220 turbofan engine. This engine
replaces the F100-PW-100 engine used in earlier F-15 models. In
comparison, it is easier to maintain, more responsive, has a longer life,
and is computer controlled to provide maximum performance throughout
the flight envelope. F-15Ks, starting with tail number 90-0233 and up,
have the F100-PW-229 increased performance engine (IPE).
Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS)
The TEWS consists of the following electronic warfare systems:

e ALQ-135 internal countermeasures set (ICS)

e ALQ-128 electronic warfare warning set (EWWS)

e ALR-56C radar warning receiver (RWR)

e ALE-45 countermeasure dispenser (CMD) set
Inertial Navigation System (INS)
The INS is a self-contained, fully automatic ring laser gyro (RLG) system
that supplies the primary attitude reference for the aircraft and provides
continuous present position (PP) monitoring. You can do a stored heading
alignment in 40 seconds or a full alignment in 4 minutes. It is accurate to

approximately 0.8 nm/hr., has reliability of 2000 hours mean time
between failure (MTBF), and can operate on emergency generator power.

D-7 ACG-1

APG-70 Radar A/G Functions

The APG-70 high frequency, pulse doppler radar retains all of the A/A
modes and capabilities of the F-15C, but includes many new A/G modes.

Improved A/G modes are incorporated to provide the necessary long range
precision cueing of the LANTIRN targeting pod. These modes are
implemented through software changes. The new modes are: high
resolution map (HRM), real beam map (RBM) and precision velocity
update (PVU).

High Resolution Map

The HRM mode provides the most accurate long range designation and
LANTIRN cueing capability. Resolution varies from 8.5 feet to 1014 feet
depending on the size map and range selected. This feature is not
available within 8° of the aircraft velocity vector; it is otherwise available
over the limits of the plan position indicator (PPI) scan.

Real Beam Map

The RBM mode permits rapid mapping of large areas. RBM permits
mapping along the velocity vector and provides backup targeting pod
cueing capability against large discrete targets. RBM provides the crew
with an indication of gross terrain features along the flight path to aid in
low altitude navigation. Additionally, the antenna manual elevation
control coupled with the pencil beam antenna pattern provides excellent
weather detection.

Precision Velocity Update

In the HRM mode, coherent doppler processing uses aircraft velocity to
display target returns at correct azimuth position. LANTIRN’s narrow
field of view requires velocity accuracies of less than 1 fps when
designating targets from radar maps at 10 nm or greater. The PVU mode
is used to determine a more refined estimate of ownship velocity than that
provided by the INS.

ACG-1 D-8


Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_15.jpeg:
Missionized Cockpits

Both cockpits are arranged to enhance situational awareness and reduce
workload. The front cockpit includes two 6-inch MPD, one 5-inch MPCD,
a UFC, an integrated engine monitor display (EMD), and a wide field of
view head-up display (WFOV HUD). The rear cockpit has two 6-inch
MPDs, two 5-inch MPCDs, and a UFC. This allows both crew members to
view data best suited for that specific mission segment. Either crew
member may view a display format in command by the other crew
member.

COCKPIT FAMILIARIZATION

The F-15E maintains the basic F-15 hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS)
philosophy for the front cockpit, and provides it in the rear cockpit too.
The crew interface eliminates many traditional control panels by
integrating the system functions, via software, into the display formats.
For example, instead of having a radar control panel to select elevation,
scan, range, mode, etc., the functions are now integrated within the A/A
radar display format adjacent to push buttons, which are arranged around
the perimeter of each MPD/MPCD. The operational technique is the same
for both front and rear cockpits.

Additional cockpit familiarization is covered by the instructor in class.

Also, refer to foldouts 5 and 7 in the Dash 1 and the handout section of
this workbook.

Multipurpose Display Group

There are few dedicated controls and displays in the F-15E cockpits. Most
systems are accessed and their output and/or indications are displayed on
a MPD or MPCD (Figure D-3). MPDs and MPCDs are functionally
similar, except A/G radar cannot be displayed on MPCDs.

Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_17.jpeg:
MPD/MPCD

The MPD/MPCDs and associated display processors provide flexibility to the
crew. The MPD/MPCDs have 20 peripheral push buttons by which the crew
controls aircraft/systems and the mission data to be displayed. For
convenience, these push buttons are referred to by number using the
numbering convention shown on Figure D-3 (for example, PB #1). Menu items
are positioned adjacent to each push button to advise the crew of the modes
and options selectable for operation. In addition to the 20 push buttons, each
MPD/MPCD has three rocker switches and one BIT indicator. Their
functions, except for the BIT ball, are the same as the similarly labeled
switches on your home TV set. The BIT ball turns white to warn of internal
system failure. Color coding of display data on MPCDs aids in quick
interpretation of complex formats such as an electronic HSI and ADI. Color
presentation of navigational maps also contributes to easy assessment of the
tactical situation.

Wide Field Of View Head-Up Display

In addition to being the “gunsight,” the HUD (Figure D-4) displays
information critical to flying and employing the F-15E. Primary HUD
displays include: aircraft attitude, AOA, current/available G and a flight path
marker called the velocity vector. Through the selection of different master
modes (A/A, A/G, NAV, Inst), the HUD also provides steering information for
various navigation and weapons delivery displays. In addition, the HUD has
the capability to display LANTIRN FLIR video for night operations. A HUD
repeater is available on any front or rear cockpit display.

Upfront Control

There is a UFC (Figure D-5) in each cockpit. The UFCs are used as the
input/output control for most of the F-15E avionic systems/functions. By
design, the UFCs take the place of conventional avionic switch panels
found on other aircraft.

Each UFC has 10 option push buttons located along the sides of the liquid
crystal display (LCD) screen. The screen consists of six 20-character rows.
The top four rows display menu/submenu options and data. The fifth row
displays UHF manual frequency data. The sixth row displays preset
channel selections and in the “scratchpad,” data that has been entered via
the keyboard. UHF preset channel select knobs are located adjacent to
the corresponding scratchpad display. UHF volume control knobs are
located below the respective channel select knobs.

SHF - permits shifting to the uppercase alphanumerics.

CLR - used to clear the scratchpad of miskeyed or unneeded data. The
first depression removes the last alphanumeric entry and the next
depression clears the entire entry. If the scratchpad is clear, the first
depression clears the top four display rows. The second depression clears
the bottom two rows. This blanking feature is designed to be used during
night operations as a way to eliminate UFC light reflections on the
canopy. To recall all display rows, depress the MENU or DATA button or
one of the top eight option buttons.

EMIS LMT - when depressed, turns off all IFF modes and stops all RF

transmissions except for the radar altimeter and the TF radar, which
switches to the low probability of intercept (LPI) mode.

ACG-1 D-14


Text from ACG-1_Aircraft_Introduction__Cockpit_Overview_page_21.jpeg:
Although you will need a thorough working knowledge of the UFC, it is
designed so memorizing submenus is not necessary. If “lost” in a
submenu, remember:

e Pressing Menu 1 or Data 1 returns you to a starting reference.

e Regardless of the display option selected, UHF frequency data is
always displayed on rows five and six. With a blank scratchpad, the
UHF submenu can be accessed from any display/submenu by
depressing PB #5 or #6.

e The scratchpad must be blank in order to change a display or to
select another option, except to elect Data 1/2 or Menu 1/2.

The UFCs design allows avionic systems control from either cockpit. The
UFC menus/submenus can be accessed from either cockpit at the same
time. However, for data entry the individual entering the data must be
the one who typed it into the scratchpad. The last aircrew input,
regardless of cockpit, is the entry that is accepted.

ADMINISTRATION
Security

Much of what you will study here is classified material. Care in
safeguarding this material is required to prevent compromise.

The administrative specialist will issue classified materials to you during
the first two weeks of the course. You must log this classified material
into the squadron student safe, located in the weapons shop.

Once signed out, the classified materials are your responsibility. NEVER
leave them unattended. Studying classified material is authorized only in
specific, designated classified study areas. You may not take classified
material to your room or off base.

Syllabus Flow
A course map and management flowchart are in the F-15E syllabus
available to review in your flying squadron or the lounge in the academic

building. The course map (Figure D-1) shows the relative order in which
the instruction is presented and how the various media fit together.

Afterburner Section

After passing through the turbines, high velocity exhaust gas enters the
afterburner section where it is mixed with the flow of bypass air. When
afterburner is selected on the throttle, fuel is sprayed into the forward
portion of the section through a series of spray rings and is ignited. Since
the air entering the afterburner section is already compressed and at high
velocity, the fuel/air ignition creates a ram jet and provides a significant
increase in thrust. Five segments of afterburner are available depending
on throttle position. Afterburner ignition is provided by two more igniters
per engine which receive their power from the same engine-mounted
generator that powers the igniters for the combustion section.
Afterburner ignition, however, is not continuous. It is provided for 1-1/2
seconds after the throttle is advanced into the AB range.

A light-off detector (LOD) in the AB section tells the system if a light-off
occurs. Once lit, the afterburner combustion is self-sustaining. However,
if a light does not occur (or is not detected), a series of events
automatically takes place without the aircrew having to recycle the
throttle. First, the system automatically terminates AB, resets to MIL
and checks to see if the LOD is functioning properly. If the LOD checks
good, three more relight attempts occur automatically. If the LOD checks
bad, one more relight attempt is made using tail pipe pressure to verify
AB light-off. If a relight occurs, you will notice it only as a hesitation in
obtaining an AB light. If the automatic relight attempts are unsuccessful,
the system resets itself to MIL (throttle in AB); this may take up to 12
seconds. Cycle the throttle out of AB and back to AB if another series of
relight attempts is desired.

Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_12.jpeg:
Variable Nozzles

The final engine section is the convergent-divergent nozzle system, which
is continuously variable between minimum and maximum opening. The
nozzles control the velocity of the exhaust gases, and therefore control the
back pressure in the engine, which in turn controls the N: turbine speed.
The nozzle actuators are operated by a mechanical cable that is driven by
a pneumatic motor. A cockpit gauge readout is provided on the engine
monitor display in percent open (i.e., 100% is fully open, while 0% is fully
closed) (Figure D-4). Another source of nozzle position is on the
MPD/MPCD, which uses digital electronic engine control (DEEC) supplied
information. The nozzles are positioned as a function of throttle setting,
but receive an additional input from the position of the gear handle. With
the gear handle down (whether or not weight is on wheels), the nozzles
open to approximately 80% at idle to minimize thrust during ground taxi
operations. The nozzles close progressively as power is advanced and are
at the closed position (5-10%) at MIL power. When the AB is in use, the
nozzles progressively open to 50-75%. With the gear handle up, the
nozzles are near minimum area at all times except at MIL or above. At
MIL, the nozzle indicators will show the nozzles slightly open (5-10%) and
as the throttle is advanced to the afterburner range, the nozzles schedule
further open to compensate for increasing afterburner fuel flow.

F100-PW-229 Engine

Newer F-15E aircraft, starting with tail number 90-233, are equipped
with the F100-PW-229 engines. It is the same basic engine as the -220
but has greater thrust and a lower cruise fuel flow. It produces 17,800
pounds of thrust in MIL and 29,000 pounds in MAX AB. The -229 has
eleven stages of afterburner as opposed to five in the -220. This provides
more power and smoother AB operation. Additional information on the
new engine will be provided at your operational unit if the aircraft there
are equipped with the -229.

ENGINE ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS
Engine Control System
Throttles

Throttles are provided in both front and rear cockpits (Figure D-5).

ACG-02-05

Figure D - 5. Throttles.

The engines may be operated from IDLE through MAX AB from either
cockpit; however, the engines can only be started and shut down with the
FCP throttles. A throttle friction lever controls the friction for both sets of
throttles and is incorporated in the base of the FCP throttle quadrant.

ACG-2 D-10


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_17.jpeg:
A set of dual-function fingerlifts are incorporated forward of the FCP
throttle grips. Lifting the appropriate fingerlift and releasing it couples
the jet fuel starter (JFS) to that engine for starting. Moving the throttle
forward (no fingerlift here) from CUTOFF to IDLE then opens the
mechanical fuel shutoff valve in the main fuel control (MFC) and
energizes the ignition circuit. The fingerlift will now lock the throttle out
of the CUTOFF range to prevent inadvertent engine shutdown. The
fingerlifts must be lifted to move the throttles below IDLE and must then
be released to move the throttles to OFF (two steps).

Movement from IDLE to OFF closes the main fuel shutoff valve, stopping
fuel flow to the engine.

In addition to the mike button and speed brake switches, which are
contained on both sets of throttles, the FCP throttles contain a number of
other switches engineered to provide control of weapon systems features
with hands on throttles and stick (HOTAS). Operation of these switches,
as well as operation of the rudder trim switches (located on both throttle
quadrants) and the flap control switch (located on the FCP quadrant), are
covered in later lessons.

Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC)

The DEECs (one per engine) are computers powered by a dedicated
engine-mounted alternator. The DEEC controls all operating parameters
for its engine from IDLE through MAX AB. It receives inputs from
throttle and landing gear handle positions. It also receives inputs from
numerous sensors located throughout the engine to schedule fuel flow,
afterburner operation and program positioning of the CIVV, RCVV,
nozzles and engine heat bleed air valves. The DEEC is programmed with
engine operating schedules and limitations and compares its program
with actual engine performance. It adjusts the engine trim to attain peak
engine performance at all times. The DEKC overrides the aircrew’s
throttle commands if it determines the commands adversely affect engine
operation. The DEEC inhibits throttle selections as required to maintain
peak engine performance. This is evident in a high altitude, low airspeed
situation when the throttles are moved into afterburner range and
afterburner operation is degraded or inhibited. In addition, it contains a
built-in logic circuit to help recover the engine if it should encounter an
engine stall and/or stagnation.

D-11 ACG-2


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_18.jpeg:
If the DEEC detects a fault that will not allow it to safely control the
engine, it will close the CIVV, close the nozzles to less than 5%, turn on
the engine control caution and transfer control of the remaining engine
variables to the main fuel control. AB operation is automatically
inhibited. Maximum thrust available with the engine in secondary mode
is only 70-80% of normal MIL power (about 85% rpm). Gradually, all -220
engines will be fitted with new MFCs, which will provide 80-100% of
normal MIL thrust in the secondary mode. Caution should be used when
operating in the secondary mode because the engine may overtemp at
high throttle settings if the nozzle is too far open. Monitor fan turbine
inlet temperature (FTIT) closely when advancing the throttle to ensure
that normal operating limits are not exceeded.

Main Fuel Control (MFC)

A main fuel control is mounted on each engine and carries out the
hydromechanical functions commanded by its associated DEEC. It
provides a secondary mode that is capable of scheduling engine operations
and fuel flow if its DEEC is not operating. Contained within each MFC is
a mechanical fuel shutoff valve. These valves are mechanically connected
to the throttles and provide the aircrew with the primary means of
terminating fuel flow to the engines. Since the MFC is located on the
engine, closing the throttle results in immediate engine shutdown, but
fuel remains in the line between the airframe-mounted fuel shutoff valve
and MFC. A small amount of fuel remaining in the line between the MFC
and engine at engine shutdown is purged overboard through ports in the
belly of the aircraft. Prior to shutdown, coordinate with the ground crew
about catching the vented fuel in a container. The -229 engine does not
purge the fuel overboard. Instead, it is cooled and recycled back to the
fuel tanks.

ACG-2 D-12


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_19.jpeg:
Engine Monitoring System

The F100-PW-220 engine incorporates an engine diagnostic unit (EDU)
that works in conjunction with the DEEC to record abnormal engine
operating statistics and flag them for maintenance repair. Readouts for
this system are found on the Avionics Status Panel on the left side of the
nose wheel well. Aircrew are not directly involved with this system, but
should know of its existence. Maintenance personnel use a data collection
unit (DCU) to retrieve information from the EDU and to read engine
faults. Engine fault flags should be checked before and after every flight.
Engine operating data and malfunctions can also be written to the data
transfer module (DTM) for postflight analysis.

CIVVs are fully closed, nozzle is closed (5%), engine thrust is
80-100% of MIL thrust and afterburner is inhibited.

If a DEEC malfunctions and switches to secondary mode, it will remain in

this mode until the failure clears and the appropriate engine control
switch is cycled from ON to OFF and back to ON.

The switches are two position (ON/OFF) electrical switches. They are
armed anytime there is a source of electrical power on the aircraft.

ON Opens the airframe-mounted fuel shutoff valve, powers fuel
transfer pumps and enables JFS/engine coupling.

OFF Closes the airframe-mounted fuel shutoff valve, turns off fuel
transfer pumps and decouples JFS from the engine.

Airframe-Mounted Fuel Shutoff Valve
There are two airframe-mounted fuel shutoff valves that are opened and

closed by using either the engine master switches or the engine fire push
buttons.

D-17 ACG-2


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_24.jpeg:
Fuel is boosted out of each of the fuselage fuel tanks, through these
shutoff valves, to the engines. The valves are physically located outside of
the engine bays to provide the capability to stop the flow of fuel to the hot
section of an engine in case of fire. Therefore, closing a shutoff valve does
not cause the engine to stop immediately since the fuel in the line between
the valve and the engine must be consumed first.

Vmax Switch

A Vmax switch is located under the FCP left canopy sill (Figure D-8). The
function of this switch is to provide a 4% increase in thrust and a 4%
increase in fuel flow at airspeeds in the top end of the envelope. When the
switch is engaged, with airspeed above Mach 1.1 and full AB selected, the
DEEC commands a 22°C increase in FTIT and a 2% increase in rpm. The
purpose of the switch is to provide an extra dash capability in an actual
combat emergency. Use of the Vmax switch is prohibited under any other
circumstance.

The switch is guarded and safety wired to the OFF position. Any use of
this switch requires an aircraft write-up and an engine borescope
inspection prior to the next flight due to possible overtemp damage in the
hot section. The Dash 1 contains other operating limits that should be
noted.

Engine data may also be displayed on an MPD/MPCD by pressing PB #18
from the menu. This is the only way engine data can be monitored from
the rear cockpit. Data displayed on the MPD/MPCD will not necessarily
agree exactly with data displayed on the EMD. The MPD/MPCD display
will be a little more accurate because the display increments are smaller.
If any engine data exceeds the display range of the MPD/MPCD, it does
not go blank as the EMD does, but continues to display the maximum or
minimum display parameter. If the FTIT exceeds 1000° or the oil
pressure is less than 8 psi (Figure D-10), the MPD displays the faulty
parameter boxed and increased in intensity. This change does not appear
for high oil pressure. Ifa color display has been selected, the parameter is
displayed in yellow and boxed. If any data signal is invalid or no signal is
being received, the word OFF is displayed. Cruise data will be covered in

Engine Oil System

The F100-PW-220 engine utilizes a fully self-contained oil system. Its
only function is to lubricate and cool the engine bearings. The main pump
element is gravity fed. System pressure is unregulated and varies greatly
with the speed of the engine. For the first minute after engine start, it is
acceptable to see oil pressure readings from 0-100 psi at idle. After that,
however, oil pressure must stabilize between 15-80 psi. Oil pressure
fluctuations of +10 psi are acceptable if the average is within limits. In
addition, the pressure difference between readings at IDLE and MIL
power on a given engine must be at least 15 psi, indicating sufficient oil
volume.

Secondary Power System

Jet Fuel Starter (JFS)

The JFS is a small jet engine used to start the aircraft engines (Figure
D-11). It provides the only means to start the engines on the ground and,
once operating, engages one engine at a time through the start sequence.
Its controls are in the FCP only. It may also be used in flight to perform a
JFS assisted restart (Dash 1, Section IIT). Fuel is provided by the main
aircraft fuel system.

JFS ignition and electrical power are provided by a JFS mounted
generator. Starting power for the JFS is provided by a hydraulic motor
driven by hydraulic pressure accumulators. These are charged
automatically by the utility system or manually by a hand pump (Figure

Figure D - 12. JFS Accumulator Servicing.

The JFS fuel circuit is energized by the JFS starter switch on the right
console. It has ON and OFF positions and normally is left ON since the
JFS automatically shuts down when the second engine reaches
approximately 40% to 50% rpm. It may be shut down at any time by
placing the switch OFF. With the switch ON, pulling the JFS handle
straight out discharges one JFS accumulator. Rotating the handle 45°
counterclockwise and pulling discharges both accumulators, or the
remaining accumulator, if one has already been discharged. The handle is
spring loaded to return to normal. Illumination of the READY light
indicates the JFS is ready to be engaged.

second engine starts, the READY light goes out as the JFS automatically
shuts down (Figure D-13).

Figure D - 13. JFS Controls.

Central Gear Box (CGB)

The CGB provides the mechanical connection between the hydraulic motor
and the JFS during the JFS start. It then provides gearing and clutching
functions necessary to transmit power from JFS to the left and right
AMADs for engine start, and then to decouple the JFS from the AMADs
once the engines come up to speed. Its function is completely automatic
and cannot be controlled from the cockpit.

ACG-2 D - 26


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_33.jpeg:
Airframe Mounted Accessory Drives (AMADs)

The left and right AMAD gear boxes are directly connected to their
respective engines (Figure D-14). The CGB utilizes this direct connection
to transmit power from the JFS to the engine during start and, after
engine start, the direct connection allows the engine to power the AMAD
accessories. The accessories associated with each AMAD include a utility
hydraulic pump, a power control hydraulic pump and a main electrical
generator. The specific functions of these accessories will be covered in
later lessons, and it will suffice to say here that all aircraft hydraulic and
electrical functions can be supported from one AMAD if the other engine
or its associated gear box should fail.

Fire Warning and Extinguishing System

Pneumatically Operated Circuitry

The F-15E incorporates pneumatically operated fire detection circuitry
that utilizes helium gas. When heated to a predetermined temperature,
this gas expands enough to trip the fire warning system. Each fire
detection loop consists of two sensor elements, which are continuously
compared and averaged against each other to eliminate false fire lights
caused by a faulty element. Two separate fire detection loops are provided
for each engine bay and one each for the AMAD and JFS portions of the
AMAD/JFS compartment.

Fire Extinguisher Bottle

A single fire extinguisher bottle, located in the aft fuselage area between
the engines, normally provides a one-shot, one-compartment capability of
extinguishing a fire. However, if more than one FIRE PUSH button is
pressed, the agent is released to all areas selected. The halon gas in the
fire bottle is nontoxic, noncorrosive and will not damage aircraft
components.

ACG-2 D - 30


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_37.jpeg:
Fire Lights

Three push button-type fire lights are located on the FCP main
instrument panel, and two engine fire repeater lights are located in the
RCP (Figure D-15). These lights come on steady when the temperature in
the appropriate bay exceeds the limits of the fire detection circuit.

A spring loaded metal guard protects the FCP fire push buttons from
inadvertent actuation. Raising the clip and depressing the AMAD FIRE
PUSH light arms the fire extinguisher bottle for release into the
AMAD/JFS compartment. In addition, if the JFS is running, a signal is
sent to a relay, which closes the fuel valve for the JFS as soon as the
discharge switch is activated.

Depressing either engine fire light simultaneously arms the fire
extinguisher bottle for release, and closes the airframe-mounted fuel
shutoff valve and the bleed air valves. The engine decelerates but may
continue running below idle rpm for up to 120 seconds until the fuel
downstream of the airframe-mounted fuel shutoff valve is consumed.

Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_38.jpeg:
Depressing any of the FCP fire lights reveals approximately one eighth
inch of yellow and black stripes around the inside lip of the light housing
to show activation. Depressing the fire light a second time disarms the
extinguisher and restores the system to normal operation and appearance.

Electrical power is required to operate the fire warning/extinguishing
system. If only the JFS is operating then only the AMAD system is
operative. Once the emergency generator is on line, the engine fire lights
are operative.

Afterburner Burn-Through Lights

The front cockpit has left and right BURN THRU warning lights to
indicate a single point burn-through or overtemperature condition in the
afterburner section. The system is independent of the AMAD/engine fire
detection system and fire suppression is not provided. The sensing
elements are located in the center keel area (to protect against engine to
engine burn-through) and in the left and right empennage boom areas (to
protect stabilator components). One main generator must be operational
before the FCP BURN THRU lights and voice warning are operational.

The top bulbs of the engine fire lights are associated with
the forward (A) transponder loop and the bottom lights
are associated with the aft (B) transponder loop. Both
loops run the entire length of the engine bay for
redundancy.

Failure of any of the pairs of lights to illuminate during
test indicates failure of the corresponding sensor loop.
(The aft cockpit engine fire lights contain only two bulbs.
If either of the sensor loops fail on an engine, the
associated fire light (RCP) will not illuminate during the
test.)

DISCHARGE Switch is lever-locked and spring-loaded to the OFF
position. Momentary contact immediately discharges the
fire bottle into the selected compartment. If the AMAD
circuit is selected and JFS is running, fuel flow to the JFS
is terminated.

Fire Voice Warning

The F-15E incorporates a voice warning system that warns of
engine/AMAD fire. This feature is activated by the same circuitry as the
fire lights. The voice warning is repeated twice and not given again,
unless the condition reoccurs after being corrected. For an engine/AMAD
fire, the voice states “WARNING, ENGINE FIRE RIGHT,” “WARNING,
ENGINE FIRE LEFT” or “WARNING, AMAD FIRE.”

Separate from the fire detection circuitry is an engine overtemp voice
warning that is activated whenever either engine FTIT exceeds 1000°. In
this case, the voice warning and an abnormal indication on the EMD or
MPD/MPCD engine display may be your only indications that this
problem exists. The warning voice states “WARNING OVERTEMP
LEFT” or “WARNING OVERTEMP RIGHT.”

For a single-point burn-through or overtemperature condition in the
afterburner section the voice warning states “AB BURN THRU LEFT” or
“AB BURN THRU RIGHT,” pauses and then repeats the warning again.

Air Induction System

The function of the air induction system is to provide air at optimum
subsonic flow to the face of the engine.

Ramps

A series of four variable ramps and a bypass door (Figure D-18) perform
this function throughout a wide range of aircraft speeds and
angles-of-attack. The ramps are referred to as the No. 1 ramp, No. 2
ramp, No. 3 ramp and the diffuser ramp. All ramps and the bypass door
are electrically controlled and hydraulically actuated, with the left ramp
operating off the Utility A circuit and the right ramp operating off the
Utility B circuit.

Figure D - 18. F-15E Inlets.

The leading edge of the air intake pivots at its lower attachment point and
constitutes the No. 1 ramp. It provides a variable capture area to
optimize air flow into the intake throughout the aircraft flight envelope.
When the aircraft is on the ground with the engines shut down, the No. 1
ramp is in the full up position. When the generator comes on the line
(approximately 56-58% rpm during engine start) the ramp moves abruptly
to the full down position and tends to stay closed to full down during
ground operations and normal cruise airspeeds. As airspeed is increased,

ACG-2 D - 38


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_45.jpeg:
the No. 1 ramp begins to program up, but regardless of speed it moves
slightly up and down as slight variations in angle-of-attack occur.

The No. 2 and No. 3 ramps are located on the inside, upper surface of the
air intake, and are visible on preflight. The No. 2 ramp is hinged to the
No. 1 ramp, and the No. 3 ramp is hinged to No. 2 in such a manner that
all three ramps move in unison whenever No. 1 ramp is repositioned.

There are hundreds of tiny holes on the inside of the No. 1 ramp and on
the face of the No. 2 and 3 ramps. These holes bleed off boundary layer
air and reduce skin friction drag. Bleed off air from the No. 1 ramp spills
through a port located on the outside of the air intake, and bleed off air
from the No. 2 and 3 ramps spill through two ports on top of the intake.

The diffuser ramp, the last of the series, is located deeper within the
intake aft of the No. 3 ramp and is not visible during a normal preflight.
Although it is hinged to the No. 3 ramp, it remains flush until the aircraft
reaches .5 Mach. At that time, the ramp begins to program down into the
airstream to prevent a shock wave from forming in the intake. The ramp
reaches the full down position at 1.5 Mach.

A bypass door located in the upper surface of the intake works in direct
correlation with the diffuser ramp. As the diffuser ramp begins to
program down, the bypass door begins to program open to provide a
spillway for air diverted by the diffuser ramp. This air, as well as the
boundary layer air bled off of ramps 1, 2 and 3, is diverted directly into the
outside airstream and has nothing to do with the engine bypass air used
for production of thrust.

Air Inlet Controller (AIC)

An AIC is provided for each side of the aircraft to program movement of
the ramps based upon inputs from three probes located in front of the air
intakes. The specific functions of these three sensors are to measure
angle-of-attack, temperature and airspeed. The inputs from the three
probes are sensed by the AIC and an output stimulus is provided to the
first ramp and the diffuser ramp hydraulic actuators. A fourth AIC
sensing device is a pitot probe located inside the air intake duct. Its
function is to measure inlet duct pressure. The signal from this probe is
fed to the AIC for the movement and control of the bypass door. The AIC
receives feedback signals from the ramps and bypass door indicating their
actual position. Any difference between actual position and the position
that has been programmed is immediately corrected by the AIC.

Inlet Ramp Switches

Inlet ramp switches for each inlet are located on the miscellaneous control
panel in the front cockpit (Figure D-19). These are two position, lever lock
electrical switches with positions labeled AUTO and EMERG.

AUTO With the switch in the AUTO position, the AIC
automatically controls the air inlet system. This is the
normal position.

EMERG With the ramp switch in the emergency position, electrical
power is removed from the ramps and the bypass door
actuators. The variable ramps are hydraulically locked up
and the bypass door is closed. If hydraulic pressure fails,
normal airloads force the ramps and bypass door to the
emergency position.

Jet Fuel Starter (JFS)

Start-to-ready-light time: 10 seconds maximum (15 seconds
if temp below 0°F).
Starter engagement time: 90 seconds maximum (150 seconds

if hot start occurs).

Time between starter engagements: 10 seconds minimum from time the
first engine is at IDLE (20 seconds
if the first engagement time
exceeds 90 seconds).

NORMAL ENGINE START
Before Start

Before starting engines verify proper switch settings. The engine master
switches, engine control switches and JFS switch should be ON. The
ramp switches should be in AUTO. Also, ensure both throttles are in the
OFF position. Clear the intake area and signal the crew chief that you are
about to start the JFS. This signal is a pulling motion, just as if you were
pulling the JFS handle. The crew chief should clear the area around the
JFS exhaust and give you a thumbs-up signal when all is clear.

You cannot monitor the JFS during its start cycle, but you can hear it. As
you gain experience, you should be able to detect abnormal performance.
The EMD is available to monitor the rpm and FTIT after the emergency
generator comes on line at approximately 15-17%. The rest of the engine
indications are inoperative until a main generator comes on at about
56-58%.

JFS Start

JFS handle-pull and release. You hear the JFS start and wind up to idle
speed (ready light comes on within 10 seconds). The intercom works and
the AMAD fire detect circuit is operational. Test the circuit by
momentarily placing the discharge/test switch in the TEST position. The
AMAD light illuminates and voice warning is activated.

ACG-2 D - 46


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_53.jpeg:
Engine Start

The right engine is normally started first to check the right utility pump
pressure. Before starting the engine, notify the crew chief on the
intercom. Once the crew chief gives you the all-clear, raise and release the
right throttle fingerlift. This engages the JFS to the right engine. JFS
engagement is indicated by an audible decrease in JFS whine followed
immediately by an increase in pitch before engagement.

Engine rotation is apparent within approximately 5 seconds. The engine
fire detect circuit is operational when RPM and FTIT indications appear
on the EMD. Test the circuit by momentarily placing the discharge/test
switch in the TEST position. All three fire lights illuminate and the voice
warning activates.

When rpm reaches 20%, place the throttle to IDLE. The JFS continues to
accelerate the engine until light-off occurs or a steady state windmill
(23-30%) is achieved. Light-off normally occurs 10 seconds after throttle
advancement, but it can take up to 30 seconds. A normal start is
indicated by rpm acceleration occurring before initial FTIT movement.
The JFS helps accelerate the engine through approximately 40-50% and
then it automatically decouples. At approximately 56-58%, the right main
generator comes on line, the right ramp moves to the down position, full
engine data is presented on the EMD, and the MASTER CAUTION and
caution light panel illuminate. The engine continues to accelerate to idle
(approximately 60-70% rpm). The EMER BST ON caution comes on when
the first generator comes on line. This indicates that both the emergency
generator and the emergency boost pump are operating properly. Thirty
seconds after the main generator comes online, the BST SYS MAL caution
comes on as the emergency generator cuts off. This indicates that the
emergency fuel boost pump is powered by an abnormal source. Ensure
that the activation of these caution lights occurs in the correct order and
at the correct time.

The procedures for starting the left engine are the same as the right, only
you can monitor the engine instruments throughout the start.

D - 47 ACG-2


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_54.jpeg:
After Start

Confirm JFS shutdown with the crew chief. The JFS automatically
decouples when the second engine reaches approximately 40-50%. Ensure
that it shuts down with the JFS switch in the ON position. The crew chief
also confirms good ECS airflow on both engines. Check that the ECS
caution light is out in the cockpit. Check that the JFS LOW caution goes
out before you clear the crew chief off.

CAUTION

To prevent possible failure of the CGB
shear section, the ENG CONTR switch
position should not be changed during a
start. The switch may be positioned to
the desired setting 90 seconds after
advancing the throttle to IDLE.

The last engine check accomplished is before brake release, commonly
called the 80% check. Holding the brakes, advance the throttles to 80%
RPM and look for the following indications: 80% RPM, 600°C FTIT, 4000
lbs fuel flow, 20% open nozzles and 40 psi oil pressure (the 8-6-4-2-4 rule
of thumb). These are not hard and fast numbers, but you should see
approximately these indications. The key factor is for both engines to look
the same. After brake release at MIL power, quickly check for at least a
15 psi increase in oil pressure above idle and that the nozzles are below
30% open. Checking that the nozzles are below 30% ensures that the
start bleed air bands are correctly closed.

MALFUNCTIONS

Starting Emergencies

JFS Ready Light Does Not Come On

If you do not have a JFS ready light within 10 seconds, but the JFS
sounds normal and the AMAD fire light tests normally, then the JFS light
may be inoperative and the start continued. However, the JFS ready light
is necessary to monitor JFS operation while airborne, so have the light
bulb replaced. (The takeoff trim light may be used as a temporary
replacement.)

If the problem is not the light, cycle the JFS switch and ensure that it is in
the ON position. Also, have the crew chief check for any apparent
abnormalities. If everything appears normal, wait 30 seconds and try
another JFS start using the second accumulator.

JFS Fails to Engage or Abnormal Engagement/Disengagement

The first indication that the JFS has failed to engage is no decrease in
JFS whine after the fingerlift has been raised. The most likely causes are
the throttles not full off, dirty switch contacts, master switches not on, an
electrical malfunction or low CGB servicing. Ensure the throttles are full
OFF, cycle the engine master and raise the fingerlift again. If still no
engagement, turn the master switches off and do not attempt another
start.

Once the JFS has engaged (JFS whine decrease) any abnormal sound or
other indication requires immediate JFS shutdown. Shut the throttle off,
turn off the engine master switch and the JFS switch, and give the
aircraft back to maintenance.

Abnormal Engine Start

Anytime the engine fails to light-off within 30 seconds after advancing the
throttle to IDLE, you should place the throttle to OFF and allow the JFS
to windmill the engine for 10 seconds to eliminate any fuel that has
accumulated in the engine during the start attempt. Another start may
be attempted.

D - 49 ACG-2


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_56.jpeg:
If a light-off is obtained, but the engine does not accelerate normally to
IDLE, abort the start by placing the throttle to OFF, the engine master
switch OFF, and the JFS switch OFF, and complete engine shutdown
procedures.

If a light-off is obtained and the engine continues to accelerate above
IDLE, it may be due to a malfunctioning MFC or Nz sensor, or the throttle
may not be connected to the MFC. In any case, every attempt should be
made to cut off fuel to the engine as quickly as possible. Place the throttle
to OFF, press the engine fire light, turn the engine master switch to OFF,
turn the JFS switch off and abort.

When making a normal start, the DEEC directs the MFC to supply lean
fuel flow until 30 seconds after the main generator comes on-line. If the
engine's start schedule is too rich or the engines starting stall margin is
too low, a hot start can occur. You may be able to detect an impending hot
start and shut the engine down before the FTIT starting limit of 680°C is
exceeded. The following are indications that the engine will probably
overtemp if the start is continued:

RPM acceleration simultaneous with or after initial FTIT movement
FTIT above 500°C with rpm below 40%

FTIT rising rapidly through 580°C

RPM stops increasing then decreases while FTIT is stable or increases

In any of these cases, you should place the throttle to OFF and allow the
JFS to windmill the engine until it cools. If the JFS has already
disengaged, allow the engine to wind down below 30% before reengaging
or you will probably shear a starter shaft.

If FTIT did not exceed 680°C, you may attempt another start after
windmilling the engine below 200°C for 10 seconds. Positioning the air
source knob to the engine being started increases the quantity of air being
bled from that engine, thereby increasing its stall margin and should
result in a cooler start. Return the air source knob to BOTH upon
reaching idle.

ACG-2 D- 50


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_57.jpeg:
If FTIT does exceed 680°C, windmill the engine as much as practicable,
place the master switch to OFF, shut down the JFS and abort the
airplane.

Engine Fire During Start (with Fire Light On and/or Voice Warning)

An engine fire is indicated by an illuminated engine fire light and/or a
voice warning of engine fire. In this case, press the fire warning light to
close the bleed air and airframe-mounted fuel shutoff valves. Place the
throttle(s) to OFF, discharge the fire extinguisher, place the engine
master switches to OFF, shut down the JFS and exit the aircraft.

AMAD Fire During Start

AMAD/JFS fires are indicated by illumination of the AMAD fire light,
activation of the voice warning system, or ground crew notification. Push
the AMAD fire light, discharge the fire extinguisher, place the throttles
OFF, place the engine master switches OFF, turn the JFS switch OFF
and exit the aircraft. Additional ground fire extinguishers may be
required if the fire does not go out immediately.

Takeoff Emergencies

Engine Failure on Takeoff

Abnormal noises, airframe or throttle vibrations and a noticeable loss of
thrust generally accompany an engine failure. Depending on type of
failure, it may or may not be preceded by caution/warning displays.
Amount of thrust remaining definitely affects your decision to abort or
takeoff.

If takeoff is continued, use a reduced pitch attitude in the climb. If AB use
on the good engine is necessary, use only enough to maintain safe flight.

Afterburner Failure

When making a max power takeoff, the nozzle position and fuel flow
should be closely monitored to ensure full AB is achieved. Throttles
should be advanced smoothly and continuously to full power without
pausing at MIL or attempting to track AB segmenting. Proper sequencing
through the five segments can be felt as the nozzles progressively step
open. The initial nozzle movement is not as important as how it continues
to open after reaching midrange.

D-51 ACG-2


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_58.jpeg:
If the sequencing slows, stops or reverses when reaching 30-50% open, it
indicates the AB is not lighting properly and the nozzle is closing to
control fan speed. Abnormal nozzle opening may be accompanied by
illumination of the MASTER CAUTION, ENGINE lights and the ENG
CONT caution. The DEEC automatically sequences the system and
makes up to three attempts to relight the AB. If the ENG CONT caution
is on, you may try recycling the ENG CONTR switch and ensure that it is
in the ON position. If the DEEC is unsuccessful in obtaining a light-off
within 12 seconds, recycle the throttle to MIL or below before attempting
further relights.

Engine Fire on Takeoff

Indication is activation of the fire warning light and/or voice warning.

If you decide to abort, push the fire warning light. If the light does not go
out, place the throttle to OFF and discharge the fire extinguisher.

If you decide to continue the takeoff, do not retard the throttle until
reaching a safe altitude. Once safely airborne, the throttle should be
retarded to IDLE and treated as a fire in flight.

In-Flight Emergencies

Inlet Caution On

L INLET or R INLET cautions come on in conjunction with the MASTER
CAUTION and ENGINE lights. This indicates failure of an AIC, improper
position of the ramp, or a diffuser ramp that did not function at the
appropriate Mach. Failure of an AIC may affect the DEEC and some
features in the flight control system. You also see this caution in
conjunction with certain utility hydraulic malfunctions, which you will
learn about in later lessons.

Check to ensure that the appropriate inlet switch(es) is/are in the AUTO
position. If the indication occurs with the switch in the AUTO position,
place the appropriate switch to EMERG and reduce speed to subsonic, but
do not retard throttle to below MIL at speeds above Mach 1.0. Limit
maneuvering to +4.0 to -1.0 G at airspeeds between .95 and .99 Mach.
You do not have an inlet caution indication with the inlet switch(es) in the
EMERG position unless the ramps fail to move to the full up and locked
position, with the diffuser ramp locked up and bypass door closed.

ACG-2 D - 52


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_59.jpeg:
Illumination of the ROLL RATIO and possible RUDR LMTR cautions
along with a failure of the engine RPM to decrease as the throttle is
moved to idle is a probable indication of an AIC malfunction. If this
occurs, reduce airspeed to below Mach 1 and turn the engine control
switch off.

Oil System Malfunction

Illumination of the MASTER CAUTION and ENGINE lights accompanied
by an OIL PRESS LOW caution only occurs with low oil pressure. Other
oil system malfunctions, such as excessive fluctuations or high oil pressure
will only be noted by reference to the EMD or the engine display on an
MPD/MPCD.

If such indications occur, place the bad engine in IDLE to see if pressure
can be maintained above 8 or below 100 psi. If not, shut the engine down
(conditions permitting) and make a single engine landing as soon as
practicable.

Engine Control Malfunction

Illumination of the MASTER CAUTION and ENGINE lights along with
an L/R ENG CONTR caution displayed on the MPD/MPCD indicate that
the DEEC has lost one or more of the signals required for it to operate
properly and/or it has switched to secondary mode (MFC scheduling
engine variables). If the L/R ENG CONTR caution is on and the
accompanying nozzle indication is less than 5%, assume that the engine is
operating in the secondary mode. Afterburner operation is inhibited and
80-100% of normal military thrust is available.

If supersonic, retard throttle to MIL and slow to subsonic. When subsonic,
set throttle to match actual engine operating parameters set by the MFC
(this will be between 80-85% rpm), and cycle the engine control switch ON
to OFF to ON. With the ENG CONTR switch ON and the ENG CONTR
light on, the engine may still be operating in the primary control mode.
This condition may provide improved operation over the secondary mode.
However, if engine operation is unsatisfactory, place the engine control
switch OFF and land as soon as practical. Gear down idle thrust will be
greater than normal. After landing, shut down the engine to reduce taxi
speed (if required).

Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_60.jpeg:
Engine Fails to Respond to Throttle Commands

If an engine is stuck at MIL or above, placing the appropriate engine
control switch off will provide 80-100% MIL thrust. If the engine is stuck
above idle, approach speeds and landing rollouts may be excessive due to
the extra thrust. Shutdown of the nonresponsive engine may be required.
If the throttle does not shut down the engine, try the appropriate engine
fire light. The engine may overtemp if the fire light is used to shut down
the engine. Be prepared for flight control transients as the engine winds
down to 0 rpm.

Nozzle Failure

The cockpit nozzle indicator indicates nozzle control unit commands, not
actual nozzle position. It is possible for the nozzle to fail open or closed
and still have normal cockpit indications. Engine stall when selecting
afterburner may be an indication of a nozzle failed closed. Gear down idle
thrust will be greater than normal with the nozzle failed closed. A loss of
thrust and lower than normal FTIT and rpm at MIL may be an indication
of a nozzle failed open or missing. If the nozzle is failed closed, leave
engine control switch on and do not exceed MIL power. If the nozzle is
failed open or missing, leave the engine control switch on and place the
affected throttle to idle. The throttle should remain at idle unless
required to maintain flight. An auto-transfer to secondary mode may
occur and FTIT may exceed limits with the throttle at MIL. Engine
operation above 850° C FTIT may cause engine failure when operating in
secondary mode with a nozzle failed open or missing. If required to
maintain flight, maximum thrust can be achieved by advancing the
throttle to MIL power in secondary mode.

AMAD Failure

AMAD failure is indicated by simultaneous loss of the entire PC system,
the utility pump and the generator on the same side. This is accompanied
by illumination of the MASTER CAUTION, HYD and generator lights,
with the appropriate cautions displayed on the MPD/MPCD.

The operating AMAD is sufficient to operate all system requirements;
however, you should reduce electrical requirements as much as possible to
reduce the load on the good generator. In addition, the appropriate
throttle should be placed in IDLE to limit any further damage, and you
should discontinue your mission and land as soon as practicable.

ACG-2 D- 54


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_61.jpeg:
Double AMAD Failure

Kyject!

AMAD Fire In Flight

Indications of an AMAD fire are illumination of the AMAD fire light and
activation of the voice warning. It may also be accompanied by electrical
problems or abnormal electrical indications.

Most probable cause of an in-flight AMAD fire is a generator malfunction.
If you are already experiencing problems with one of the generators,
simply turning that generator OFF may eliminate the AMAD fire. If not,
push the AMAD fire light, discharge the fire bottle and land as soon as
conditions permit. If the fire persists, switch the emergency generator to
MANUAL and turn one generator OFF at a time and try to locate the
generator causing the fire. As with an engine fire, always test the circuit
if the fire light goes out to ensure that the circuit is still working and has
not simply been burned through.

Engine Stall/Stagnation

Most stalls are associated with afterburner use. They are normally
accompanied by an audible pop, bang or thud, but may occur without
audible warning. This may be your only indication that a stall has
occurred since most stalls are self-clearing or cleared by DEEC logic.

More severe stalls/stagnations are indicated by rapidly increasing FTIT,
decreasing rpm, opening nozzles and lack of throttle response. If your
attention is focused outside the cockpit, and no audible indication is noted,
your first indication may be a MASTER CAUTION, ENGINE light, along
with GEN OUT and EMER BST ON caution displays.

D-55 ACG-2


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_62.jpeg:
The throttle should be rapidly chopped to MIL if in AB and then to IDLE
if the stall does not clear. If you were not operating in AB when the stall
occurred, chop the throttle to IDLE right away. Check the engine heat
switch off. If FTIT cannot be controlled, shut down the engine and
perform an airstart. If FTIT has not exceeded 1000°C, normal engine
operation limits apply. If FTIT exceeded 1000°C, the engine may be
restarted to provide redundant hydraulic and electrical power, but you
should terminate the mission, leave the throttle in IDLE (unless needed
for safe flight) and return to base. Stalls may also be caused when the
ENG HEAT switch is on. The mission may be continued with the switch
OFF, if conditions permit. However, if subsequent stalls occur, follow
normal stall procedures and land as soon as practical.

Restart

In the F-15E, fuel and ignition are continuously available when the
throttles are at IDLE or above. Restarts are generally required only
because an engine has been shut down for some reason. If an engine must
be shut down, a spooldown restart (rpm 30-50%) results in the fastest
restart. If rpm is allowed to unwind to 12% or below, high airspeeds (up
to 450 KCAS) may be required to accelerate the engine, or a JFS air start
may be required. If the rpm drops below 12%, the DEEC may transfer to
the secondary control mode and the ENG CONTR caution may come on.
Once rpm increases above 12%, the DEEC will resume primary control
and the caution will go out if the engine control switch was left on.

Indications of a normal airstart are similar to a ground start, except that
you may notice FTIT decrease after it increases several times before the
engine reaches IDLE rpm. In addition, it may take 2 minutes to achieve a
successful start above 35,000 feet and at slow airspeeds. An unsuccessful
restart is indicated by a steady decrease in rpm or FTIT increasing
through 800°C with rpm hung or decreasing. Consider a secondary mode
(SEC) start (ENG CONTR switch OFF). Start procedures for a primary or
secondary start are the same; however, a higher airspeed is required for
secondary starts. Restart time for a secondary start ranges from 30
seconds at sea level to 60 seconds above 30,000 feet.

ACG-2 D - 56


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_63.jpeg:
Double Engine Stall/Stagnation/Failure

If altitude permits, immediately lower the nose to maintain/achieve 350
knots. Check FTIT and rpm to determine whether the engines are flamed
out or stagnated. If they are flamed out, rpm and FTIT decrease equally.
If they are stagnated, rpm decreases while FTIT increases. If the
flameouts are caused by fuel starvation, they may restart. If the engines
are stagnated, they must be shut down and restarted. Check engine heat
switch off. Shut down the right engine first unless FTIT exceeds 1000°C.
If 1000°C is exceeded, shut down the engine with the lower FTIT. Your
most immediate concern is to maintain enough airspeed to keep the
engines windmilling fast enough to produce hydraulic pressure to the
flight controls. A single engine at about 18%, or both engines at 12%, will
power the flight controls and emergency generator. This requires an
airspeed of approximately 350 KCAS, which can be maintained with a
10° dive. At much slower speeds, a momentary steep dive may be
required to rapidly attain 350 KCAS. Once steady state rpm is
established, excessive airspeed/dive angle reduces time available for
restart.

You can expect the engine left in stagnation to be extensively damaged
and may not restart if temperatures are above 1000°C. Therefore, do not
shut down the second engine until a restart is indicated on the first
engine. If imminent loss of control is indicated by loss of the emergency
generator and/or PC system dropping to 0-EJECT.

D-57 ACG-2


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_64.jpeg:
JFS Assisted Restart

The JFS may be used to assist an airstart attempt when other attempts
have failed or are considered impractical. This procedure takes more time
than a normal restart attempt; therefore, consideration should be given to
the safe ejection envelope prior to starting the procedure. In addition, the
jettison of anything on the centerline may be required because it disrupts
airflow to the JFS at most altitudes and airspeeds, and severely restricts
the envelope in which the JFS can be started successfully (Figure D-21).

Maintain one engine at 18% or above (even in stagnation) throughout the
procedure to power flight controls and the emergency generator. Start the
JFS just as in the ground start procedure. If either engine is to be shut
down with the JFS running, release the fingerlift before reaching the
CUTOFF position, and use care not to engage the JFS to an engine
rotating above 30% rpm since this will probably shear the starter shaft.
When starting the engine, place the throttle to MID RANGE rather than
to IDLE to allow a smooth and continuous acceleration to a useful power
setting.

ACG-2 D - 58


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_65.jpeg:
Engine Fire In Flight

Engine fire is normally indicated by illumination of a fire warning light,
activation of the voice warning, muffled thumps, vibrations and/or erratic
engine data readings. Due to the location of the fire sensor loops, fire in
the aft portion of the AB or nozzles may not be detected by the engine fire
warning system. In this case, you may get the L(R) BURN THRU light
and voice warning, which should extinguish in 30 seconds after placing
the throttle to IDLE.

Reducing the throttle to IDLE often causes the fire to go out within a few
seconds. If the fire light goes out, test the fire circuit to ensure it is still
working and, if so, leave the throttle in IDLE and land as soon as
conditions permit.

If the initial throttle reduction is not effective, push the fire warning light
to cut off fuel flow outside the engine bay, place the throttle to OFF to
shut off fuel flow at the engine, and then discharge the fire bottle. Once
again, any time the fire light goes out, test the warning system and
continue to monitor other fire indications while attempting to get the
aircraft on the ground as soon as practicable.

Afterburner Burn-Through

If the left or right afterburner burn-through lights come on/the voice
warning is heard, retard the throttles to MIL or below.

Single Engine Operation

The aircraft has excellent single engine handling characteristics. Best
single engine cruise is approximated by climbing at 250 KCAS until rate
of climb stops. Accelerate to 0.6 Mach in MIL and then cruise climb as
fuel weight decreases. Refer to single engine landing.

D-59 ACG-2


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_66.jpeg:
Landing Emergencies

Single Engine Operation

System redundancy allows the aircraft to operate normally on a single
engine, and sufficient power is available for flight. However, to avoid
relying totally on one system for electrics and hydraulics, consider leaving
the bad engine at IDLE if it is feasible and safe. Some yawing moment is
evident during single engine operation, which becomes more pronounced
at higher power settings. Therefore, avoid situations that would require
high thrust settings on the operating engine.

When you study hydraulics, you will learn about the operation of the
hydraulic switchover valves that provide system redundancy for flight
control operation. For now, if operating with a windmilling engine,
monitor hydraulic pressure and avoid flying at an airspeed that produces
fluctuations between 800-2000 psi. It is in this range that the hydraulic
switchover valves operate. If allowed to fluctuate back and forth, it may
produce repeated flight control transients, reduced control sensitivity,
momentary split flaps and CAS disengagements.

INTRODUCTION

The F-15E (prior to tail number 90-0233) is powered by two Pratt and
Whitney F100-PW-220 turbofan engines. This lesson will mostly cover the
F100-PW-220 engine (sometimes called PW-220 or just -220). Kach
engine produces 14,500 pounds of thrust in MIL and 24,000 pounds of
thrust in MAX AB. The -220 features a variety of improvements over
previous engines. The most significant improvements are a digital
electronic engine control, increased engine core life, improved afterburner
and an engine monitoring system.

THE TURBOFAN ENGINE

The turbofan engine draws more air than it requires for ignition. The air
is split between the engine core and a bypass duct at the front of the
engine (Figure D-1). Bypass air helps cool the engine core and provides
high-performance AB operation and extra thrust. Turbofan engines have
two independently rotating turbines allowing each turbine compressor
section to rotate at its optimum speed and provide high pressure output.

ANSWERS
Abnormal engine start

Probable hot start if allowed to continue because FTIT
started increasing before rpm.

Throttle - OFF

Allow the JFS to windmill the engine until it cools to
below 200°C, wait 10 seconds, place the air source knob
to the right engine, then go throttle idle to attempt
another start.

Left engine stall/stagnation

Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_8.jpeg:
Turbojet (non-bypass) engines provide considerably less thrust increase in
AB over MIL and lower pressure output power than turbofan engines.
However, improved performance comes at the expense of slower response
to throttle increases, especially at high altitude. Also, the turbofan is
more susceptible to compressor stall and engine stagnation than
non-turbofan engines.

MAJOR COMPONENTS

The F100-PW-220 engines have six major sections or modular
components. They are the fan, compressor, combustion chamber,
turbines, afterburner and the variable nozzles (Figure D-2).

Fan Section

The first major component of the engine is the fan section (low pressure
compressor). The three stage fan draws in a large quantity of air and
begins to compress it. The compressor inlet variable vanes (CIVV) are in
front of the three stage fan and are variable in pitch to minimize airflow
turbulence within the engine. Once the air is past the fan section, the
flow dividers split the airflow and direct most of it (60%) through the main
compressor section and into the combustion chamber. The remaining air
(40%) flows around (bypasses) the engine and is routed into the
afterburner section.

ACG-2 D-2


Text from ACG-2_Propulsion_System_page_9.jpeg:
Compressor Section

The second major engine section is the compressor (rear or high pressure
compressor). It consists of ten stages of stators and rotors that further
compress the air coming into the engine prior to entering the combustion
section. The first three stages of the compressor have variable vanes
called the rear compressor variable vanes (RCVV) (Figure D-2). They help
prevent turbulent air entering the section from stalling the compressor.

Combustion Section

The third section is the combustion section, consisting of a continuous
combuster mounted circularly around the engine. Compressed air is fed
into this section and mixed with the proper amount of fuel in the
combustion section where it is ignited. Ignition is provided by two igniter
plugs per engine. The igniter plugs are powered by their own small
engine mounted generator and operate continuously when the throttles
are out of the CUTOFF position (i.e., continuous ignition). High velocity
exhaust gas is then vectored rearward through the turbine section.

Turbine Section

The turbine is the component providing the power to keep the engine
operating. The PW-220 has two independent, two-stage turbines. One of
these is connected to the fan while the other is connected to the
compressor (“twin-spooled”). They are numbered Ni and Nz2 respectively.
Note in Figure D-2 that although the Ni turbine powers the front-most
part of the engine, and is therefore numbered first, it is actually located
aft of the N2 turbine. The speed of the Ni turbine, and therefore the speed
of the fan, is controlled by back pressure in the engine. The aircrew has
no direct control over the Ni turbine, and no cockpit indications are
provided to indicate its rotation speed. What the aircrew controls through
the throttle is the rotation speed of the Nz turbine and, consequently, the
compressor.

External Tanks

These tanks are part of the first level of a three-stage transfer/feed system
(Figure D-2). They use engine bleed air pressure, not pumps, to force fuel
into any internal tank that will accept it. The tanks are interchangeable
and can be carried on wing and centerline stations. They are each
mounted on a pylon that is attached to the aircraft hardpoints. They are
the only tanks that do not have fire suppressant foam or self-sealing
capability. External tanks can be jettisoned regardless of their content
quantity. Because of this capability, the external tanks are called “drop
tanks.”

Conformal Fuel Tanks

The conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) are also part of the first level transfer
system. They transfer fuel by means of transfer pumps (two per tank) to
any internal tank that has room for it. CFTs are divided into three
compartments to ensure the CG moves forward as the fuel is transferred
and are bolted on the outside of each engine nacelle (cannot be jettisoned).
They contain explosion suppressant foam slabs for survivability.

Transfer Tanks

The transfer tanks are the second level in the transfer/feed hierarchy.
They are composed of tank 1 and the right and left internal wing tanks
(Figure D-2). A single pump in each tank is used to transfer fuel to either
feed tank that has room for it. These tanks contain fire/explosion
suppressing foam to enhance survivability.

Transfer Pumps

The CFTs, internal wing tanks and tank 1 all contain transfer pumps to
move fuel (Figure D-3). The internal tank pumps normally operate
anytime main generator power is available (or on ground power with an
engine master switch on). The CFT pumps use the same power source
logic, but can be turned on or off with a cockpit fuel control switch on the
fuel control panel. Transfer pumps provide fuel flow to power hydraulic
ejector pumps that ensure that all fuel in the tank 1 auxiliary tank and
the CFT forward compartments is transferred. The internal wing and
tank 1 transfer pumps require main generator power (or ground power).
They will not operate from emergency generator power. The CFT transfer
pumps can be selectively operated from emergency generator power
during special circumstances (covered later).

Fuel Lines

There are two sets of lines running from the internal transfer tanks to the
feed tanks (Figure D-4). In case of transfer pump failure(s), fuel
eventually gravity transfers through the lower line, but not until the fuel
being transferred by the operative fuel transfer pumps and the external
tank/CFT fuel has all been transferred to the feed tanks.

Feed Tanks

The feed tanks are at the third level of the transfer/feed system (Figure
D-4). The feed tanks provide fuel directly to the engines. Tanks 2 & 3,
normally called the right and left feed tanks, respectively, supply fuel
under pressure to their respective engine. The left feed tank is really
composed of two interconnecting tanks (8A & 3B) but it is most commonly
referred to as a single tank. The JFS gets its fuel from tank 3B. Both
feed tanks are internally baffled so you can sustain negative Gs or
inverted flight for a limited time (7 seconds maximum). The tanks contain
a protective lining that gives them a self-sealing capability if punctured by
a bullet or other small projectile. They also contain fire/explosion
suppressant foam.

ACG-3 D-6


Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_13.jpeg:
Boost Pumps

Each feed tank has a boost pump to supply boosted fuel to the engines
(Figure D-5). Without fuel being boosted (pressurized), it may vaporize
and the engines will flameout. The left feed tank also contains the
emergency boost pump, which comes on if the left and/or right main boost
pump malfunctions, a main generator fails or both transformer rectifiers
fail. With any of the above three situations, a system of interconnect and
crossfeed valves open between the left and right feed tanks ensuring both
engines are supplied boosted fuel by the remaining operating boost
pump(s), and the emergency generator will come on and power the
emergency boost pump.

Heat Exchangers

There is a radiator-like device in the fuel line between each feed tank and
its respective engine called a heat exchanger. These exchangers routinely
circulate cool fuel around lines containing hot AMAD oil, integrated drive
generator (IDG) oil and hydraulic (PC and utility) fluid (Figure D-6).
Some of the heat is transferred to the fuel, thereby cooling the fluids while
heating the fuel to a more optimum combustion temperature. If the fuel
leaving the exchanger is too hot, a recirculation valve opens and routes a
portion of the fuel back to the internal wing tank for cooling. If the valve
on one side is open, the other valve opens to preclude a possible imbalance
of fuel between the left and right internal wing tanks.

SYSTEM OPERATIONS

The fuel system’s primary job is to keep fuel flowing to the engines. It
does this in a three-stage transfer/feed hierarchy (Figure D-7). The
external tanks and CFTs transfer their fuel to any internal tank(s) that
will take it, followed by the internal wing tanks and tank 1 transferring
the fuel to the feed tanks. Fuel is boosted from the feed tanks to the
engines. This design attempts to ensure that the feed tanks are
continuously full (even with fuel transfer malfunctions), unless engine
demand is higher than the fuel transfer rate.

Transfer System
External Tanks

External tanks are normally transferred first, assuming the fuel control
switches are positioned appropriately. The fuel is moved exclusively by
engine bleed air pressure, so transfer pump or electrical system failure is
not a factor. The external wing tanks receive a slightly higher pressure
(25 psi) than the centerline tank (15 psi) so they should normally transfer
first. (The aircrew can choose to transfer the centerline tank first through
cockpit fuel control switches). Monitor the appropriate tank(s) as transfer
occurs to detect any transfer malfunction early, before it becomes a

Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_16.jpeg:
significant problem. Be aware, however, that it is not uncommon for the
external wing tanks to transfer at different rates, and even for one to
empty significantly before the other one.

Conformal Fuel Tanks

The CFTs transfer together, normally after the externals go dry or
whenever the internal transfer tanks are not being kept full by the
externals. If this happens, the CFTs can “kick in” and augment the
externals. There are two transfer pumps in each CFT, one in the aft
compartment sump and one in the center compartment sump, which
transfer the fuel in a manner to automatically maintain the proper center
of gravity. The center and aft compartment sumps are connected by a
float-controlled interconnect valve, which isolates the two sumps until the
aft compartment is almost empty or the aft transfer pump fails. The
center pump runs an ejector or “sucker” pump, which empties the forward
compartment into the center compartment. If both CFT transfer pumps
are inoperative, fuel from that CFT cannot be transferred.

NOTE

On aircraft 90-0233 and up, after TCTO 6J14-5-11-521, the ejector pump is
moved to the aft compartment (vice the forward compartment) to aid in

fuel transfer from the aft compartment. The forward compartment gravity
transfers to the center compartment.

Internal Wing Tanks and Tank 1

The internal transfer tanks are normally the last to deplete. Each tank
has one electric transfer pump. Tank 1 also has an ejector pump that
empties its aux tank. After tank 1 transfers its first 200 pounds, tank 1
and each internal wing tank normally transfer fuel at the same rate
pound for pound. Should tank 1 fail to feed, anticipate a forward shift in
aircraft CG as the internal wing tanks empty. This forward CG condition
will increase aircraft departure susceptibility until tank 1 gravity feeds;
which will not happen until the internal wing tanks are empty. Restrict
AOA to below 30 units anytime tank 1 fuel is greater than 750 pounds
more than either internal wing tank.

ACG-3 D-10


Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_17.jpeg:
Engine Feed System
Each feed tank provides fuel under boost pump provided pressure to its
respective engine (Figure D-8). After fuel leaves the feed tank, it passes

through a heat exchanger. This interaction keeps the fluids cool while
warming the fuel, which enhances combustion.

EXCHANGERS

The feed system is capable of boosting fuel to both engines unless all three
boost pumps fail. If only one boost pump is working, sufficient pressurized
fuel still goes to both engines but the aircraft operating envelope is
restricted to less than 30,000 feet altitude and nonafterburner operations.
If you experience total boost pump failure, the engines are suction fed and
the probability of one or both engines flaming out is high.

In a single engine situation, the fuel in the feed tank for the inoperative
engine does not feed to the operative engine. In fact, the tank remains full
until the level in the other feed tank reaches FUEL LOW caution
activation. Then the interconnect and crossfeed valves between the feed
tanks open allowing the inoperative engine’s feed tank fuel to be used for

the operating engine.

D-11 ACG-3


Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_18.jpeg:
Pressurization and Vent System

Engine bleed air is routed to all tanks (except the CFTs) to provide
positive tank pressure to prevent vaporization/boil-off at altitude (the
CFTs use their own ram air system to do the same thing). Additionally,
the bleed air pressure is used to transfer fuel from the external
wing/centerline tanks. Tank pressurization is a function of the physical
position of the landing gear handle. Normally, pressure is applied with
the handle up and removed with it down.

The internal tanks are vented through right and left wing tip vents. The
CFTs have their own vents and the external tanks are vented through
their respective pylon. The system provides for proper pressure relief
during climbs and vacuum relief during descents.

INDICATORS

Fuel Quantity Indicators

All fuel quantity indications are combined into a gauge in each cockpit
(Figure D-9). The front cockpit gauge is located just above the JFS

handle. The rear cockpit gauge is located on the instrument panel next to
the clock. It is a repeater gauge that displays only internal and total fuel.

On the FCP gauge the top scale and pointer indicate total internal fuel (in
thousands of pounds). The digital counter immediately below this shows
total fuel onboard. The two counters labeled LEFT and RIGHT indicate
fuel quantity for the tanks selected on the rotary fuel quantity selector
knob below. When set to EXT CTR or TANK 1, the left counter displays
fuel quantity for that tank and the right counter zeros out. When you
select the BIT position, the pointer and TOTAL LBS counter drive to 6000
and the LEFT and RIGHT counters drive to 600 as a test of the gauge.
The knob must be held in the BIT position.

The FCP fuel quantity indicator also contains the bingo knob and the
bingo index or bug. Together with the BINGO caution indication on the
MPD/MPCD and the voice warning, they serve as a fuel quantity warning
system. Using the bingo knob you can set the bug to any total internal
fuel reminder that you want-bingo, joker, etc. It can also be set above
6000 before initiating the BIT so that the MPD/MPCD caution and voice
warning activation will be tested, as the fuel needle drives below the bug
position. Again, the bingo warning is referenced to total internal fuel.

Both the FCP and RCP fuel gauges will operate off emergency generator

power if main generator power is unavailable. Each gauge has an OFF
flag, which is displayed when electrical power to the gauge is not provided.

External/Conformal Fuel Tank Control Switches

These three 3-position switches labeled WING, CTR and CONF TANK
control the transfer of fuel to (refueling) and from (transfer) the CFTs and
external tanks during normal fuel transfer and refueling operations
(Figure D-10). The NORM or center position of each switch allows both
transfer and refueling of the associated tank(s). The STOP REFUEL
position prevents the associated tank(s) from being refueled on the ground
or airborne. You must have electrical power for the switches to function.
STOP TRANS stops fuel from transferring from the respective tank(s)
unless the FUEL LOW caution is displayed. The STOP TRANS position
for the conformal tanks turns off the CFT transfer pumps. When this
happens, the valves are automatically opened (regardless of the switch
position) for as long as the fuel low condition exists. Once the feed tanks
are filled above the fuel low sensors, the tanks for which STOP TRANS is
selected will cease transferring until the FUEL LOW reoccurs.

During start and before takeoff ground operations, the CFT control switch
should be positioned to STOP TRANS to prevent the CFTs from venting
fuel on start and to allow the tank 1 fuel to transfer. During the before
takeoff check, the pilot checks tank 1 quantity to ensure tank 1 is
transferring and then positions the CFT control switch to NORM.

ACG-3 D-16


Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_23.jpeg:
External Transfer Switch

This two-position switch (Figure D-11) labeled EXT TRANS selects the
priority of either the external tanks or the CFTs to transfer first. If you
choose WING/CTR, the external tanks transfer first, followed by the
CFTs. This is the normal setting if both EXT & CFT tanks are installed.
Placing the switch to CONF TANK allows the CFTs to transfer before the
externals. It is important that the switch position reflects the actual
configuration of the aircraft. If the selected priority tanks (WING/CTR or
CONF TANK) are not installed on the aircraft, the internal fuel will
deplete approximately 1100 pounds; then the nonpriority tanks will fill
the internal tanks. The internal fuel will then deplete 1100 pounds and
the “cyclic” transfer will repeat. If fuel demand is too high for the priority
tank(s), the nonpriority tank(s) will “kick-in” in this cyclic manner in an
attempt to keep the internal tanks full. The fuel quantity sensor, which
provides for this “cyclic” transfer, is located in tank 1. If the tank 1
transfer pump fails, the nonselected system will not transfer until after
the FUEL LOW when tank 1 begins gravity feeding the feed tanks.

Ground Transfer

Fuel transfer during ground operations is the same as airborne transfer,
with one exception. The external tanks do not transfer (because the fuel
system is not pressurized with the gear handle down). Checklist
procedures call for STOP TRANS to be selected during engine
start/ground operations to prevent CFT fuel venting. The pilot should use
this opportunity to ensure that tank 1 fuel is transferring by noting the
decrease in tank 1 fuel (it is not being replenished by either external or
CFT fuel). Engine start and ground operations normally require about
1500 lbs (from tank 1 and internal wing tanks). Tank 1 fuel quantity
should drop about 600 Ibs (from 4000 lbs to about 3400 lbs) and should be
within 500 lbs of the fuel quantity in each internal wing.

Dump Switch

This two-position switch is in the NORM position when dumping is not in
progress. When DUMP is selected, it is electrically held to allow for
automatic dumping operations. The fuel dump system allows you to
automatically dump fuel to either the quantity set with the bingo bug or
approximately 2750 lbs (feed tank fuel), whichever is greater. The BINGO
FUEL caution, by design, causes the dump switch to physically return to
the NORM position. Be aware that there are known instances of this not
happening. The aircrew should confirm that the switch is in the NORM
position and visually confirm that dumping has stopped. Of course,
manually selecting NORM also terminates dumping. Fuel dump rate is
approximately 910 PPM (pounds per minute). The uneven dump rates of
the internal tanks (left internal wing 260 PPM, tank 1 260 PPM, right
internal wing 390 PPM) creates an internal wing lateral fuel imbalance of
130 PPM (1100 pounds maximum). The asymmetry will remain until all
the internal wing fuel is depleted (dumped or transferred) or the tanks are
refilled.

Slipway Switch

The slipway switch (Figure D-11) controls air refueling functions. It is
discussed later in the air refueling section.

Conformal Tank Emergency Transfer Switch

The conformal tank emergency transfer switch is discussed later in the
malfunction section.

Fuel Shutoff Valves

A fuel shutoff valve is located in each fuel line, aft of the heat exchanger
and forward of the engine main fuel control (Figure D-12). It is normally
open but can be electrically closed (in 2-3 seconds) by turning the
appropriate engine master switch off or by pushing the associated fire
push light in the front cockpit. It provides an alternate fuel shutoff
capability to the main fuel control (throttles) and is also further upstream
in the system. This is important to consider in case of a fuel leak.

Ground Refueling

Ground refueling is accomplished through the single point receptacle
under the left engine intake. No electrical power is required for the
operation. The external tanks can be refueled separately, if required.
Procedures exist for refueling with the engines running (“hot refueling”).

Air Refueling

Fuel can be taken onboard from a KC-135 or KC-10 through the air
refueling receptacle which is beneath the slipway door. This assembly is
located on top of the left engine inlet just aft of the rear cockpit area. It
consists of the door, the receptacle, area lighting (slipway and flood) and a
pressure switch. The cockpit controls and indicators consist of a READY
light, the slipway switch, an emergency air refueling switch (Figure D-13)
and an air refueling release button on each stick grip (Figure D-14).

RELEASE (ARR)

ACG-03-14

Figure D - 14. Air Refueling Release/Disconnect (ARR) Switch.

The 3-position slipway switch is the primary air refueling control. Its
positions and related functions are:

OPEN

Moving the switch to this position turns off the transfer pumps
in the CFTs and in tank 1, hydraulically opens the door, and if
the door opens, depressurizes the external tanks (if the fuel low
caution is not on) and turns on the exterior refueling lights. The
READY light also comes on indicating the system is ready to
accept the tanker's refueling boom.

When the boom contacts the receptacle, the locking mechanism
engages, the READY light goes out and fuel is transferred at a
maximum rate of about 3000 lbs/minute. For CG control a float
switch located in tank 1 prevents the external tanks from being
filled until tank 1 contains at least 1560 lbs. The CFTs will
start refilling, regardless of tank 1 fuel quantity.

D-25 ACG-3


Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_32.jpeg:
CLOSE

ORIDE

ACG-3

The boom remains engaged until either the boom limits are
exceeded (at which time it automatically disconnects) or the
crew or boomer manually initiate a disconnect. The crew can
initiate manual disconnect by depressing the air refueling
release button on either stick grip. At this time the system
automatically recycles (takes about 3-5 seconds) and the READY
light again comes on.

Going to this position turns on the transfer pumps in the CFTs
(CFT transfer switch in NORM) and in tank 1, closes the
slipway door, repressurizes the external tanks, reestablishes
fuel sequencing and turns off exterior refueling lights and the
READY light.

This position is similar to OPEN but may allow refueling when
certain malfunctions exist. The two differences are that the
automatic disconnect and tanker initiated manual disconnect is
lost (the F-15E crew must initiate all disconnects) and the float
switch in tank 1 is bypassed. To prevent an undesirable CG
condition select STOP REFUEL for the external tanks until
tank 1 fuel quantity is above 1560 lbs. ORIDE should not be
used during normal peacetime operations unless refueling is
critical due to a low fuel state.


Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_33.jpeg:
Emergency Air Refueling

If you have to air refuel and the slipway door does not open normally (for
example, utility hydraulic failure), there is a backup. With the slipway
switch in OPEN, place the emergency air refueling switch to OPEN. This
fires a pyrotechnic device, blowing the slipway door open. The slipway
lights and the READY light illuminate; however, the READY light will not
go out nor will the boom lock in place. “Pressure” refueling must be
accomplished. The door cannot be closed, but the external tanks can be
pressurized and tank 1 and CFT transfer pumps are made available by
putting the normal slipway switch to CLOSE.

Fuel Dumping

All fuel but that in the feed tanks can be dumped overboard through a
dump mast located on the trailing edge of the right wing tip. Placing the
dump switch to DUMP opens the valve and allows the transfer pumps and
engine bleed air to force the fuel out at a rate of about 910 lbs/minute.
Dumping will stop when (1) the dump switch is returned to NORM; (2)
only fuel in the feed tanks remains, even with the switch still in DUMP;
(3) the pointer on the fuel quantity indicator reaches the bingo bug, which
returns the solenoid-held dump switch to NORM. One thing to keep in
mind—you can dump fuel on the ground just like in the air. All you need is
electrical power and the switch in DUMP. This is not a guarded switch, so
avoid inadvertent selection of the DUMP position.

NOTE

The right internal wing tank’s 20 gpm faster dumping rate produces an
internal wing tank imbalance (left wing heavy condition) of
approximately 130 lbs per minute of dumping to a maximum of about

1100 pounds (when the right internal wing tank is empty). The fuel
imbalance will decrease as fuel in the left internal wing tank is depleted
from below 1100 pounds to empty.

MALFUNCTIONS
Uncommanded Fuel Venting/Fuel Leak

These two malfunctions have no special warning or caution indicators,
and can be quite insidious. The fuel quantity being much lower than
planned at a certain mission point or excessive fuel flow may be the only
indication until FUEL LOW appears. In the case of venting, you or a
wingman should notice the spray, in most conditions. The greatest danger
comes from not being able to reach a recovery base; and in the case of a
leak, possible in-flight fire/explosion. Refer to the checklist for the
appropriate procedures.

Cautions and Warnings

There are eight different caution indications that apply to the fuel system.
When the conditions for activation are met, one or more of the following
occurs: a yellow caution light illuminates on the FCP (and, in some cases,
RCP) caution panel; a caution message appears on the appropriate
MPD/MPCD; a voice warning message is sent to both cockpits. When any
of these occur, the master caution lights in the front and rear cockpits also
illuminate.

The fuel cautions are: BINGO FUEL, FUEL LOW, FUEL HOT, EMER
BST ON, BST SYS MAL, L BST PUMP, R BST PUMP and XFER PUMP.
Conditions relating to the BINGO caution have been described previously.
The caution indications that occur for a certain malfunction and the
specific condition that activates each of the cautions will be presented in
the next section. Refer to the checklist in all cases.

ACG-3 D - 28


Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_35.jpeg:
Fuel Low

Fuel low indications warn you of a low fuel level in one or both engine feed
tanks. The system is completely independent of the fuel quantity
indicating system and responds to sensors in each feed tank (Figure D-15).
The FUEL LOW caution light (both cockpits) and a voice warning which
says “WARNING, FUEL LOW” are activated when you have about 1600
lbs total feed tank fuel remaining. The sensors are exposed with less than
1000 lbs in the right feed tank or 600 lbs in the left feed tank. If transfer
falls behind engine consumption, the system can activate with fuel
remaining in other tanks; and in some high transfer situations, fuel spray
may wet the sensors inhibiting the cautions. When FUEL LOW comes on,
fuel will transfer from the external tanks and CFTs, even with STOP
TRANS selected on the fuel control panel. FUEL LOW overrides the
landing gear handle and external tanks fuel will be transferred with the
landing gear handle down. FUEL LOW also overrides the slipway switch
for external tank pressurization/fuel transfer. It will not, however, turn
on the tank 1 transfer pump or the CFT transfer pumps if the slipway
switch is in OPEN or ORIDE.

Fuel Hot

A FUEL HOT caution on the MPD/MPCD indicates that the temperature
of the engine feed fuel is too high and recirculation to the wings has failed
to reduce the temperature to prevent vaporization. Advancing the
throttles to a higher power setting (but not afterburner) to get higher fuel
flow should help extinguish the FUEL HOT caution. If this caution
remains on more than 5 minutes on the ground, abort the mission.

Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_36.jpeg:
Transfer Malfunctions

External Tanks

If electrical power is lost, fuel still transfers since no electrical pumps are
involved. However, if engine bleed air is shut off, the fuel remaining in
the external tanks is trapped. The ram air fuel pressurization backup
capability provides only about 2-5 psi pressurization. This is insufficient
for external tank pressurization/fuel transfer, as the normal engine bleed
air for fuel pressurization provides about 25 psi for external wing tank
fuel transfer and 15 psi for external centerline tank fuel transfer.

If other tanks begin to transfer before the externals show empty in their
proper sequence, or if the wing externals indicate significant imbalance, a
transfer problem is possible. No cautions appear and any fuel that does
not transfer is trapped. Normally, landing with one full and one empty
external wing tank presents no significant problems. If CG, flight control
malfunctions, or other factors warrant, the tank(s) may be jettisoned.

Internal Transfer Tanks and/or CFTs

A “Warning, Transfer Pump” voice warning and a “XFER Pump”
MPD/MPCD caution come on if an internal wing or CFT transfer pump
fails. However, the fuel quantity gauge readings are the primary means
of detecting transfer problems. By monitoring the tanks that are
transferring, you have the best chance of catching a malfunction early. In
each case refer to the appropriate section of the checklist for the
procedures. There is no caution/warning for a tank 1 transfer pump
failure. If the aircrew does not monitor the tank 1 fuel quantity, they will
be unaware of a tank 1 transfer pump failure until a premature “FUEL
LOW” alerts them that there is a fuel transfer problem.

Emergency Transfer

Each transfer tank has backup capability that varies among the types of
tank.

ACG-3 D - 30


Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_37.jpeg:
Emergency Fuel Transfer/Dump (External Tanks), Gear Down

While this is not a malfunction, doing it probably comes from being
involved in an emergency situation. As previously stated, with the gear
handle down, bleed air pressure is removed from the external tanks and
external fuel cannot be transferred/dumped normally. If you must
transfer/dump external tank fuel, pulling the emergency gear handle to
keep the gear down then raising the normal landing gear handle
pressurizes the external tanks, but the landing gear remains extended.

CFTs

If a CFT pump fails, the voice warning (““WARNING, TRANSFER PUMP”)
and XFER PUMP MPD/MPCD caution indicate a pump malfunction.
Cycling the CFT transfer switch to STOP TRANS confirms a CFT problem
if the caution goes out. If the caution remains on, the failure involves an
internal wing transfer pump. Reference the fuel gauge to determine the
specific problem. As each CFT has two pumps, losing one decreases the
transfer rate, while losing both traps any fuel remaining in the tank
(Figure D-16).

Emergency Transfer—CFT

This three-position switch (Figure D-17), labeled CONF TANK EMERG
TRANS, is only functional in the absence of main generator power. It is
normally positioned in the center (NORM) position. With both generators
off and/or failed, the CFT transfer pumps are unpowered. Moving this
switch to the L or R position powers the left or right CFT center transfer
pump (emergency generator power). The L/R positions also turn off all
aircraft pitot heaters to limit the drain on the emergency generator. The
emergency CFT transfer procedure involves depleting the internal fuel to
about 1000 pounds below full, then filling the internal tanks alternately
from the left and right CFTs. If the gear is down the fuel may simply
transfer between the two CFTs rather than to the internal tanks.

Internal Wing Tanks

If an internal wing tank pump fails, the voice warning, “WARNING,
TRANSFER PUMP,” and XFER PUMP MPD/MPCD caution indicate a
pump malfunction. Cycling the CFT transfer switch to STOP TRANS
confirms an internal wing tank transfer pump failure if the caution
remains on. Reference the fuel gauge to further identify the problem.
Substantially more fuel in one internal wing tank than the other, or more
in either wing than tank 1 confirms an internal wing pump failure. In
either case, fuel will eventually gravity transfer. However, a significant
lateral imbalance (up to 3300 pounds) can occur before this happens.

ACG-3 D - 32


Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_39.jpeg:
Internal Transfer Tanks

With internal transfer pump failure (tank 1 or internal wing), fuel gravity
transfers from that tank at a reduced rate, and only after the other
transfer tanks are empty. It flows through the gravity transfer lines
depending upon the fuel level difference in the tanks (Figure D-18). You
can help the gravity transfer of fuel from tank 1 (should the need arise) by
maintaining a 3° to 7° nose-up pitch attitude, allowing the fuel to run
downhill. Any loss of internal transfer pump(s) reduces the transfer rate;
and, although it should be sufficient for normal cruise, it may be
insufficient to keep up with high engine demand. With no transfer pumps
operating (for example, double main generator failure), fuel will gravity
transfer at a maximum rate of 3500 PPH per engine.

Tank 1

A transfer pump failure in tank 1 is probable if the difference between the
higher tank 1 quantity and the internal wing tank quantities exceeds 750
pounds (550 +200). Again, no cautions appear. However, the aircraft is
now restricted to 30 units AOA. The fuel is still usable as it will
eventually gravity transfer, but only after the internal wing tanks are
empty.

Lateral Tank Imbalances

The maximum imbalance between the CFTs is expected to be no more
than 500 lbs. If a sustained imbalance of 1000 lbs or more exists for more
than 5 minutes, it is a discrepancy, requiring a 781 writeup.

If a sustained imbalance between the left and right internal wing tanks of
200 lbs or more exists for more than five minutes, it is a discrepancy. Ifa
fuel asymmetry between left and right readings for the total of both
internal wing tanks and CFTs is over 600 lbs, then the aircraft is
restricted to 30 units AOA.

Boost Pump Malfunctions

Single Boost Pump Failure

Indications of this malfunction are a L BST PUMP or R BST PUMP and
an EMER BST ON caution displayed on an MPD/MPCD in both cockpits.
Also the EMER BST ON caution panel light illuminates (FCP only)
(Figure D-19). The reason for these indications is that one of the main
boost pumps (left or right) has failed or is putting out insufficient
pressure. The EMER BST ON means that the emergency boost pump has
come on and is being powered by the emergency generator. You still have
two boost pumps providing pressurized fuel to the engines. Refer to the
checklist for the procedure, but, in short, do not use afterburner and land
as soon as practical.

Double Boost Pump Failure

If the L BST PUMP and R BST PUMP cautions appear together, or if
either appears with the BST SYS MAL caution (no EMER BST ON), you
have a double boost pump failure (Figure D-20). In the first case the
EMER BST ON will also be displayed, indicating the emergency boost
pump is working. In the second instance, BST SYS MAL without the
EMER BST ON indicates that the emergency boost pump has failed or is
not providing sufficient pressure. Now only one pump (either a main
boost pump or the emergency boost pump) is boosting fuel to the engines.
However, this should be enough to keep the engines running at all
nonafterburner power settings below 30,000 feet. Refer to the checklist
for the procedure.

CAPABILITIES & LIMITATIONS
Capabilities

The tanks and lines have been designed to be damage resistant, being
either self-sealing and/or containing polyether-based foam for
fire/explosion protection. This new type of foam does not break down over
time and contaminate the fuel (as with previously used types of foam).

Fuel lines are routed inside the tanks where possible, and when routed
outside the tanks, are self-sealing. The fuselage fuel tanks are
surrounded (sides and bottom) with explosion suppression polyether foam.

With a maximum fuel load the F-15E has the advantages of extended
range, increased combat mission flexibility and sustained afterburner
operations. This fuel load would typically give the aircraft a combat
radius of 450 nm in an air-to-ground profile carrying a mix of bombs and
missiles. On a cross country with maximum fuel load, the aircraft is
capable of 2000 plus mile legs (depending on in-flight winds and fuel
reserve requirements).

Limitations

The engines can use fuel at a tremendous rate. At low altitude in full AB,
total fuel flow can exceed 150,000 lbs per hour. Maximum transfer rate,
at best, is only 117,000 lbs per hour. The potential to empty the engine
feed tanks and flameout with fuel still onboard exists!

When fuel system malfunctions occur, restrictions to the aircraft operating

envelope apply. Specific restrictions are discussed in the malfunctions
section of this workbook.

D-1 ACG-3


Text from ACG-3_Fuel_System_page_8.jpeg:
CAPACITIES

The F-15E can have quite a variety of fuel loads depending on what tanks
are installed and what the mission requirements are. To be able to
interpret the fuel gauge and determine if the fuel system is operating
properly, you need to know the capacity of each type of tank.

The following is a list of fuel tank quantities using 6.7 lb/gal of JP-8 as the
standard (at 65° Fahrenheit).

Tank 1 about 4050 lbs
Right feed (Tank 2) about 1550 lbs
Left feed (Tank 3) about 1250 lbs
Internal wings about 3300 lbs each
CFT about 4900 lbs each
Externals about 4100 lbs each

A little addition shows that with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) and three
external tanks loaded there is about 35,550 lbs of fuel available. That is
about nine T-38s full. Here are some examples of fuel loads you might
see:

Full internal only about 13,550 lbs
Full internal plus CFTs about 23,300 lbs
Full internal, CFTs and

external centerline tank about 27,350 lbs

You have the capability to go a long way without refueling. The aircraft
feels and handles differently throughout the course of the mission because
of changing fuel quantities that affect aircraft gross weight and center of
gravity (CG).

DESCRIPTION AND COMPONENTS

The F-15E can carry about as much fuel as it weighs. Fuel is located
internally in feed tanks and transfer tanks. Additional fuel is carried in
external wing/centerline tanks and conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) (Figure
D-1). All tanks may be refueled on the ground or in the air. All fuel
except that in the feed tanks may be dumped overboard. The primary fuel
is JP-8, but some other fuel types may be used if required. Fuel flow and
performance may vary slightly with other types of fuel.

Emergency Generator

Emergency AC/DC power is available through the emergency generator,
driven by the utility hydraulic system (Figure D-5). The emergency
generator is separate from the primary system and provides electrical
power during electrical system failure and initial engine start.

=

ACG-04-05

Figure D - 5. Emergency Generator.

The emergency generator is a critical backup system. When you are ready
to start, hack the clock and raise the right finger lift to start the right
engine.

When the engine reaches 15-17%, enough hydraulic pressure is present to

start the emergency generator. This should occur within 30 seconds
(maximum) after raising the finger lift.

D-5 ACG-4


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_12.jpeg:
During a normal start, you can verify that the emergency generator comes
on-line. Note in Figure D-6 that the top two lines (RPM and FTIT) are
powered by the emergency generator and register on the engine monitor
display (EMD).

If the engine is rotating and the top two lines of the EMD fail to register
readings, it is possible (but unlikely) that the EMD, rather than the
emergency generator, has failed. An easy way to troubleshoot is to test
the engine fire lights. If they test good, the problem is the EMD. If they
test bad, the problem is the emergency generator.

ACG-4 D-6


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_13.jpeg:
If the emergency generator does not come on-line, cycle the emergency
generator switch through ISOLATE. If that does not solve the problem,
position the engine master switches and JF'S switch to OFF and abort the

mission.

When the right main generator comes on-line (about 56% rpm), the EMER
BST ON and L GEN cautions illuminate to show that both emergency
generator and emergency boost pump are operating properly (Figure D-7).
(Other cautions—such as ENGINE, FLT CONTR, HYD, etc.—illuminate

During normal start, 30 seconds after the main generator comes on-line,
the emergency generator shuts off to avoid needless operation. The only
indication of this is the BST SYS MAL caution light (Figure D-8). It
comes on in addition to the EMER BST ON caution to show that the
emergency fuel boost pump is now operating from an abnormal power
source—a main generator.

If the BST SYS MAL caution illuminates less than 30 seconds after the
first main generator comes on-line, the emergency generator has dropped
off-line prematurely. (If rpm and FTIT go blank before the BST SYS MAL
caution illuminates, this is also an indication of premature cutoff.)
Position the throttles and engine master switches to OFF and have
maintenance investigate.

When the second main generator comes on-line, the EMER BST ON and
BST SYS MAL cautions go out along with the L GEN, ENGINE, and HYD
caution lights.

ACG-4 D-8


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_15.jpeg:
NOTE

The FLT CONTR light will be on because the CAS switches have not been
reset (yaw CAS, roll CAS, pitch CAS, HIGH AOA DEGRADE cautions
also illuminate). The AV BIT light is usually on (unless an aircrew
member has pressed a master caution light) because most systems are
turned off.

AC Generators

The two main AC generators are mounted on the right and left AMADs. A
constant speed drive (CSD) maintains frequency control throughout the
entire rpm range of the engines. When both generators are operating,
each independently supplies power to certain aircraft AC buses

(Figure D-9). If either generator should fail, the other provides necessary
power via a crossover system.

Current Limiters

Each generator circuit is also protected by a current limiter (a slow-blow
type fuse that cannot be reset). It prevents a fault in one generator from
damaging the other generator, which causes both generators to be shut
down. It also prevents overloads on the remaining generator during
single generator operation. If a current limiter (i.e., current limited fuse)
blows, the associated crossover circuit is broken. The generator control
unit (GCU) logic assumes that improper current fed from that generator
caused the current limiter to blow. It then takes that generator off-line to
prevent further damage. Therefore, power is removed from the associated
bus. However, if the other generator is on-line, it transfers current via the
remaining crossover circuit, and powers both buses. The GCU continues
to monitor current output from the off-line generator. When that current
is within standards again, the generator can be reset (placed back on-line)
to power its own bus.

Generator Control Switch

The L and R GEN control switches are two position (OFF and ON)
lever-lock type switches (Figure D-10). They must be raised before being
moved to a new position. You may disconnect a generator from its buses
(place it off-line) at any time by positioning its switch to OFF.

The GCU disconnects the generator from its buses if a fault occurs, then
transfers the electrical load to the other main generator. When this
occurs, the master caution and L GEN or R GEN caution lights come on
and you may notice a momentary interruption of power. When a
generator caution light flashes, the GCU has identified an under
frequency condition and is trying to reset the generator automatically.

The generator control switch must be cycled OFF/ON to reset the
generator after most faults (except under frequency) occur.

D-11 ACG-4


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_18.jpeg:
DC Power

TRs convert AC power from the main generators to DC power for the DC
buses. The left and right TRs have a protection system (TRCU) similar to
the AC system. If the system isolates a faulty TR, the remaining TR
powers the entire DC system. A third TR (the essential TR) operates
independently of the other TRs.

No cockpit warning of a single TR failure is provided. The emergency

generator only activates when both main TRs fail. TR failure is covered in
the emergency operations section of this text.

Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_22.jpeg:
ANSWERS

1. a. Main generator: The two main generators supply AC electrical
power to the aircraft.

b. GCU: The GCU protects the generator against damage due to
voltage, frequency, and mechanical failure. It disconnects the
generator from its buses if a fault occurs. At the same time, it
transfers the electrical load to the other main generator’s bus.

c. TR: TRs are used to convert AC to DC. There are three of them.
Two power the left and right DC buses. One powers the
essential TR DC bus.

d. Emergency generator: Supplies emergency AC/DC power in the
aircraft. It can power all systems necessary for a safe recovery.

e. Bussystem: The bus system distributes power to the aircraft
electrical systems.

f. Current limiter: A current limiter prevents a fault in one
generator from causing both generators to be shut down or
damaged.

g. JFS generator: Provides JFS ignition and control, AMAD fire
detection/extinguisher during start, FCP utility light and
intercom system until the main generator comes on-line.

2. See note 2 on page FO-13. The armament bus is energized with the
landing gear handle up. If the landing gear handle is in the down
position, the armament bus can be energized by placing the
armament safety override switch to the OVERRIDE position.

3. a. Generator control switch: Connects/removes a generator to/from
its buses.

ACG-4 D-16

10.

11.

12.

b. Emergency generator switch: Controls emergency generator. If
placed in the AUTO position, the emergency generator will be
automatically activated if either/both main generators are
inoperative, both left and right TRs fail, or if either/both main
fuel boost pumps fail. The MAN position provides manual
activation of the emergency generator. The ISOLATE position
restricts the emergency generator to powering the emergency
fuel boost pump, arresting hook, and emergency air refueling
switch.

Test the AMAD fire light. If it tests OK, have the crew chief replace
the JFS light.

Situation A: (Questions 7-9) You are starting an F-15E (no external
power connected). With the JFS running, you raise the finger lift and
the whine of the JFS tells you that the JFS has engaged the engine
and operation is normal. You feel the engine rpm increase, but 30
seconds later you have no rpm indications on the EMD.

The emergency generator did not come on-line.

You should try to bring the emergency generator on-line by cycling
the emergency generator switch to ISOLATE and then back to the
AUTO position.

Position the engine master switches to OFF, JFS to OFF, and abort.
Situation B: (Questions 10-12) While starting the right engine, you
note that the rpm and FTIT indications are normal. The EMER BST
ON caution appears (i.e., R main generator comes on-line). Fifteen

seconds later the BST SYS MAL caution appears.

The BST SYS MAL caution illuminated prematurely (30 seconds has
not elapsed).

The emergency generator failed and dropped off-line prematurely.

Position the throttles OFF, the engine master switches off, and have
maintenance investigate the malfunction.

External Power

External power may be connected to the aircraft through an external
electrical receptacle near the nose gear wheelwell (Figure D-12). External
power is used mainly by the ground crew during repair and maintenance.
On rare occasions, you may be requested to do an external power start.
Follow your checklist.

EXTERNAL POWER

Figure D - 12. External Power.

The aircraft buses are energized by external power in a manner similar to
an operating main generator. Exceptions are those buses which furnish
power to systems that do not have on/off control switches and/or require
cooling air. Power can be applied to these buses by using ground power
switches (covered later in this section).

If you are on external power and start the left engine first, the complete
electrical system automatically switches to internal power when the left
generator comes on-line.

ACG-4 D-18


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_25.jpeg:
If the right engine is started first, however, the right generator powers
only the buses it normally feeds. The buses usually fed by the left
generator remain on external power (except those supported by the JFS
generator) until external power is removed or the left engine is started
and the left generator comes on-line.

External Power Control Switch

The three position external power control switch, located on the engine
control panel (Figure D-13), controls application of external power to the
aircraft electrical buses. An external power monitor prevents faulty
external power from being connected to the aircraft.

Ground Power Control Panel/Switches

Seven ground power switches are located on the ground power control
panel (Figure D-14). These switches are primarily used by maintenance
to power up systems that require cooling air. Be sure they are in AUTO.
Placing these switches to ON allows external power to be connected to the
avionics group associated with the individual switch. The switches are
electrically held on and will revert to auto if internal power is available or
external ground power is disconnected. OFF prevents any power from
being applied to the respective avionics group(s).

ANSWERS

1. a. External power control switch - Controls the application of
external power to the aircraft electrical buses. In NORM
position, aircraft electrical buses can be energized by external
power if no aircraft generators are running. RESET will
establish external power if it is not on the line. (RESET is
spring-loaded to NORM.) OFF disconnects external power from
the aircraft.

b. Ground power control panel switches - Maintenance uses these
switches to power up systems that require cooling air. Check to
be sure they are in AUTO position.

EMERGENCY OPERATIONS

This section deals with electrical system operation and corrective action
necessary in the following emergencies:

Emergency generator operation/failure
Main generator failure

Transformer rectifier(s) failure

Complete electrical system failure

Smoke, fumes, or fire in cockpit (electrical)

AMAD failure

Emergency Generator Operation/Failure

System features: The emergency generator supplies power to the
essential AC/DC buses, the emergency/essential buses, and ground power
switch number 1 (28 volt DC bus for operation of the engine monitor
display). The emergency generator automatically comes on-line when:

Either or both main generators fail,
Both left and right TRs fail,
Either or both main boost pumps fail (or pressure is low),

Or some combination of these faults occur.

D - 37 ACG-4


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_44.jpeg:
The emergency generator control switch is located at the top center of the
engine control panel (Figure D-27). It is a three-position toggle switch
with positions of AUTO, MAN, and ISOLATE. The switch is electrically
held in ISOLATE when positioned there.

AUTO provides automatic activation of the emergency generator. In this
position, after an internal power ground start, the emergency generator
will shut down 30 seconds after the first main generator comes on-line.
(For all starts with external power the emergency generator will not
operate while external power is connected.)

MAN provides manual activation of the emergency generator and connects
it to its buses.

ISOLATE restricts the emergency generator. It supplies power to the
emergency fuel boost pump, the EMER BST ON caution light, arresting
hook, the emergency/essential 28 volt DC bus (for the emergency air
refueling switch to open the slipway door) and ground power switch
number 1 (28 volt DC bus for operation of the engine monitor display
[EMD)]) (top two lines only).

NOTE

MSOGS and cockpit intercom are not available in ISOLATE.

If the emergency generator fails to come on-line, you will see BST SYS
MAL in addition to L or R GEN. (This failure is remote since you verified

the emergency generator was working during start.)

NOTE

A generator must be recycled to reset over/under voltage, over frequency,
feeder faults or generator locked rotor after the fault clears in order to put
the generator back on-line.

D-41 ACG-4


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_48.jpeg:
Actions for single generator failure:

e Check that the L/R GEN caution is not caused by an AMAD failure or
engine problem (e.g., a stall/stagnation or flameout).

e Cycle the failed generator’s switch to OFF and back ON - once.
e RESTORED? - Leave it alone and write it up later.

e FAIL TO RESTORE? - Turn the switch OFF and return to base.
e CAUTION - Be sure that you cycle the CORRECT SWITCH!

Double Generator Failure

A double generator failure is indicated by:

e All MPDs and rear cockpit MPCDs go blank. The front cockpit
MPCD displays an ADI and indicates the cautions.

e = Loss of normal cockpit lighting.

e Both L GEN and R GEN cautions light (along with the master
caution).

e Emergency generator and emergency boost pump activate (EMER
BST ON caution).

e HYD caution lights (warning systems lose power source).
e Landing gear warning is displayed (air data computer is out).

e Loss of power to the instruments and equipment listed as inoperative
in the Dash 1 and/or in the checklist.

NOTE: In the event of a double generator failure, the inertial navigation
system (INS) is backed up by the emergency generator, through the
essential AC bus. The crew would have INS for navigation and IFF and
UHF #1 available for a GCA recovery. (ILS and TACAN are inoperative.)
The attitude heading reference system (AHRS) works off the left 115V AC
bus, so it would not be available. Under TCTO 1F-15E-737, the EGI
(embedded GPS/INS) replaces the AHRS and the exact wiring is not yet
known.

While many other cautions are also on, you are interested in knowing if
the emergency generator is working. Check EMER BST ON caution
(Figure D-31).

The emergency generator can provide enough power to get you home after
a dual generator failure. It automatically powers the essential buses IF
you left the emergency generator switch in AUTO or MAN.

Actions for double generator failure:

e Maintain control of the aircraft.

e Verify that the emergency generator is working. Check EMER BST

Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_50.jpeg:
Critical equipment and instruments - The Dash 1 and checklist provide
some vital information for you. Get to know the equipment and
instruments that will and will not work during a double generator failure.
Even if you can look it up while in the air, the situation may call for faster
action. Plan for those situations now.

Follow the double boost pump failure procedure. You can navigate using
INS but you will not have TACAN available. Since ILS is inoperative, you
must fly a visual approach or a GCA on the EADI and standby
instruments using UHF #1. If your emergency generator fails, you must
be prepared to perform the total boost pump failure procedure.

Transformer Rectifier Failure

If either left or right TR fails, the other TR powers the entire DC system.
The failure of both left and right TRs automatically activates the
emergency generator if the emergency generator switch is in AUTO.

Remember, you have no cockpit indication of a single TR failure;
therefore, it is possible to accept an aircraft with only one operational left
or right TR. Test switches for the TRs are located in the electronic bays
and are checked by maintenance.

The failure of both left and right TRs result in loss of the left and right 28
volt DC buses. Flight capabilities may be degraded by the loss of the
equipment powered by these buses (Ref. TO 1F-15E-1, pages FO-13 and
15). The most noticeable equipment lost would include:

Right 28V DC bus Right boost pump relay (lose pump)
HYD pressure indication
XFER pump indication
Aft left and right MPCD
Right air inlet control
Armament bus
LANTIRN NAV/TGT POD

Left 28V DC bus Left boost pump relay (lose pump)

Complete Electrical System Failure
Certain manual systems are available without electrical power.
Remember, there is no battery in this aircraft.

With no electrical power available (AC or DC), you lose the use of all fuel
boost pumps and the arresting hook.

But even then, the aircraft can be recovered.

The following systems are still available:

e = =Flight controls (manual)

e =6 Engine ignition

e §=6© Gravity fuel feed

e Emergency landing gear extension

e Emergency nosewheel steering and brakes

e  =Brakes (no antiskid protection)

e Standby airspeed, heading, and altimeter (ADI for 9 minutes)

With the limited equipment available, remain VFR and land as soon as
possible.

Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_52.jpeg:
Smoke, Fumes, or Fire in the Cockpit

Equipment in the cockpit uses low current levels, so wiring insulation may
smolder, but there is little chance of a serious fire. Also, there are no fuel
or hydraulic lines passing through or near the cockpit area.

Smoke, fumes, or fire in the cockpit indications:

The indications are self-explanatory; however, some general guidance is in
order:

e Consider all unidentified odors as toxic.

e Do not confuse condensation from the air conditioning system as
smoke.

e Acharacteristic of the F-15E is emission of a pungent blue-gray
smoke from the air or defog outlets during engine run-up and takeoff
roll. It is something you learn to recognize.

Action for smoke, fumes, or fire in the cockpit:

e Go to 100% oxygen and emergency on the regulator.

e Ifrequired, turn and pull the emergency vent handle when you are
below 18,000 feet (below 25,000 feet if situation warrants).

e = Follow steps listed in your checklist.

Attempt to trace the source of unidentified smoke or fumes. (Electrical
smoke is usually white or grey in color).

e If cockpit visibility is restricted, jettison the canopy.

WARNING

If the cockpit is the source of smoke or
fumes, jettisoning the canopy may cause
an eruption of flames around the
occupants.

ACG-4 D - 46


Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_53.jpeg:
AMAD Failure

An AMAD failure is indicated by the simultaneous loss of the PC system,
the utility pump, and the generator on the same side.

The corrective action is to position the throttle to idle, reduce electrical
requirements, and then refer to the checklist for a list of inoperative
equipment.

Double AMAD Failure

If double AMAD failure occurs, total electrical and hydraulic power is lost
and aircraft control is not possible. EJECT.

Text from ACG-4_Electrical_System_page_56.jpeg:
ANSWERS

1. During a normal start, you can verify the emergency generator is
on-line by noting that the right engine rpm registers on the engine
monitor display (EMD). The fan turbine inlet temperature (FTIT) is
too low at this point to display.

When a main generator comes on-line, the EMER BST ON and R or
L GEN cautions illuminate to show that both emergency generator
and emergency boost pump are operating properly.

2. EMER BST ON will be displayed. It is important because it is the
only indication that the emergency generator is working.

Situation A: (Questions 3-6) During flight, you notice the loss of
many systems and equipment. The MASTER CAUTION is
illuminated and the L GEN, R GEN, and EMER BST ON cautions
are displayed.

3. The malfunction is double generator failure.

4. Because the BST SYS MAL caution is not displayed, and EMER BST
ON is displayed, the emergency generator is operating.

5. Try to restore one or both of the generators by cycling the generator
switches.

6. The corrective action brought the left main generator back on-line
and restored power to all the electrical equipment. The right main
generator remained failed resulting in the R GEN and EMER BST
ON cautions continuing to be displayed.

Situation B: (Questions 7-8) During flight, you have lost both main
generators and are using the emergency generator as the primary
source of electrical power. Weather and available facilities require
that you make an ILS approach if you wish to land at Seymour
Johnson AFB.

7. No

8. ILS is inoperative with both main generators failed (see your
checklist). Go to your alternate.

Reduce the throttle to IDLE, reduce electrical requirements, and
refer to Electrical and Hydraulic Failures.

The emergency generator is operating since EMER BST ON is
displayed and the BST SYS MAL caution is not displayed.

Situation E: (Questions 15-18) During flight, you notice the
MASTER CAUTION illuminate. You note that R BST PUMP, EMER
BST ON, and BST SYS MAL cautions are displayed.

The malfunction is a right boost pump failure.

The EMER BST ON indicates that the emergency boost pump is
operating; however, since the BST SYS MAL caution is displayed, the
emergency fuel boost pump is being powered by an abnormal
electrical source.

TEXT
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM COMPONENTS

The electrical power system for the F-15E consists of two main AC
generators, three transformer rectifiers (TRs), a hydraulically driven
emergency generator, and a power distribution (bus) system (Figure D-1).
The main generators are driven by the airframe mounted accessory drive
(AMAD).

The main generators produce 115 volt AC power and three TRs convert
the AC to 28 volt DC. During typical operation, each main generator
powers its own separate AC/DC bus. Each has the capacity to supply all
the basic aircraft electrical requirements. If a fault is detected in one
system, either generator picks up the load of the other automatically.

The emergency generator automatically comes on when one or both of the
main generators fail or are turned off. The emergency generator can
power systems necessary for a safe recovery.

Windshield Anti-Ice Switch

This switch (Figure D-10) controls hot airflow from the primary heat
exchanger to the windshield exterior anti-ice air nozzle. The WNDSHLD
HOT caution is a function of windshield anti-ice air temperature and does
not measure the temperature of the windshield. Therefore, it is possible
to severely damage the windshield without any prior warning. Use this
switch only when necessary and then ensure it is turned off. One
technique is to guard the switch with your hand when it is on.

CAUTION

Use of the anti-ice system under non-icing conditions
may damage the windshield.

Engine Anti-Ice/Heat System

The engine anti-ice/heat system consists of an ice detector in the left inlet
duct and the engine anti-ice/heat system. The ice detector is always on. It
activates the inlet ice caution on the MPD/MPCD when an icing condition
exists in the left inlet duct. The engine anti-ice/heat system uses 13th
stage bleed air to prevent icing on the front of the engine. Bleed air
passes through a DEEC/engine anti-ice/heat switch controlled shutoff
valve and into the engine inlet case. The engine anti-ice/heat switch is
located on the ECS control panel and has three positions (Figure D-11).

ON Activates the engine anti-ice/heat system

OFF Deactivates the engine anti-ice/heat system

TEST Checks the ice detector operation, and turns on the inlet
ice caution, as well as the MASTER CAUTION and yellow

The DEEC automatically shuts off the engine anti-ice/heat when any of
the following conditions exist.

e Altitude is above 30,000 feet
e Engine inlet temperature is above 60°F
e Throttle is beyond mid range

e Bleed air gets too hot (above 750°F)

PITOT STATIC SYSTEM

The pitot static system uses multiple pitot and static sources for
redundancy and to provide each engine inlet controller with conditions
particular to that inlet during flight. There is an airstream pitot static
mast on each side of the forward fuselage, and a pitot mast and flush
static port on each inlet duct (Figure D-13). Together they provide total
and static air pressure to the standby instruments, air data computer
(ADC), pitch/roll channel assembly, flap airspeed switch, dynamic
pressure sensor assembly and the inlet controllers.

The MSOGS, located behind door 6R, consists of an oxygen concentrator,
regulator (Figure D-17) and an integral, self-charging backup oxygen
system (BOS).

OXY BIT

ACG-05-17

Figure D - 17. MSOGS Regulator.

After TCTO 1F-15E-561C or TCTO 1F-15E-725 (latest modification),
preconditioned bleed air from the water extractor portion of the air
conditioning system is the only source of air to the MSOGS.

NOTE

Because MSOGS uses ECS air, if ECS is turned off (cabin temp switch
or air source knob OFF), MSOGS capability (except for breathing gas

remaining in the BOS) will be lost. MSOGS will also be lost if only the
emergency generator is operating in isolate.

To ensure the proper amount of inlet air is available for power-up BIT and
to eliminate false concentrator BIT latches, MSOGS should be run only
after the second engine has been started.

The system provides air that has been filtered to remove nitrogen and
provides oxygen enriched breathing gas to the aircrew. All contaminants
may not be filtered out. It is possible to get fumes from other aircraft
system failures (such as hydraulic fumes) through the ECS. The
concentrator automatically selects the backup oxygen supply (BOS) during
a system failure. The MSOGS monitor/controller continuously samples
the breathing gas to ensure the oxygen concentration of the output gas is
above acceptable levels. The aircraft essential bus supplies electrical
power for MSOGS.

D-21 ACG-5


Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_28.jpeg:
The regulator of the MSOGS looks very similar to the LOX regulator. The
PBG (pressure breathing) option on the supply lever is fully discussed in
the COMBAT EDGE system explanation in the next section of the
workbook. The system is electrically driven. During engine start and
shut down, the FCP supply lever should be off. Move the lever to ON after
both generators are operating. In this case, the aircrew may have to start
with the oxygen masks off because the system will not supply air to
breathe until the system is electrically powered.

CAUTION

Do not lift the regulator toggle switch
when switching between OFF and ON.
Damage to the regulator switch will result.

The BOS provides a total of 16 minutes of oxygen enriched breathing gas
(8 minutes per crew member). BOS normal pressure is 20-450 psi. If BOS
pressure drops below 20 psi, breathing may be restricted. If pressure goes
below 16 psi, the BOS activates to build back normal pressure. If the
bleed air pressure is low (e.g., single engine/single bleed source idle
descent), the system may switch to the BOS. Normal mode will be
selected again when the bleed air pressure is restored (throttle advanced
to 73-74%). BOS is automatically recharged when MSOGS is producing
93% oxygen enriched gas and adequate pressure is available to the
concentrator. A minimum of 28 psi on the oxygen gauge is required to
charge the BOS.

BOS cannot be manually selected. It can be tested and selected via the
OXY BIT button. The system performs a power up BIT on start. The
OXY BIT light illuminates with a successful BIT. Reset by pressing and
releasing the OXY BIT button/light two times in the front cockpit only.
(The first push acknowledges the BIT and checks the BOS. The second
push exits the BOS.) If the power up BIT fails, the OXYGEN caution and
MASTER CAUTION lights come on. The system also performs a
continuous BIT. If the system fails the continuous BIT, the oxygen
caution light and master caution light illuminate. The system then
switches to BOS. Ifthe situation is corrected, the cautions are removed
and the system reverts from BOS back to the normal system. You can
also perform a power up BIT by turning off the front cockpit regulator for
more than 1 second and then back to on.

ACG-5 D - 22


Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_29.jpeg:
You can check the BOS by using the OXY BIT button. Pressing and
releasing the OXY BIT button switches the system to BOS and allows the
aircrew to read the BOS pressure on the gauge. You should get a BOS
pressure reading less than 450 psi, MASTER CAUTION light and
OXYGEN caution. Pushing the OXY BIT light a second time extinguishes
these lights and puts the system back to normal. As you breathe, the
pressure returns to the normal MSOGS pressure range of 10-60 psi.

COMBAT EDGE System

Combined Advanced Technology Enhanced Design “G” Ensemble
(COMBAT EDGE) equipment is an acronym for an innovation in
technology that gives the fighter aircrew a combat edge in the air-to-air
arena.

The COMBAT EDGE system operates in normal flight and pressure
breathing for G (PBG) modes. The equipment enhances aircrew tolerance
to G forces. The supply/mode control lever (located on the aircraft
regulator panel), controls selection between normal flight oxygen supply
and PBG (Figure D-18). The proper mix of cockpit air and oxygen at the
correct pressure is supplied to the mask as a function of altitude. This
function is called pressure breathing for altitude (PBA).

Pressure Breathing for G (PBG) Operation

COMBAT EDGE provides the tactical aircrew member with a PBG system
for positive acceleration protection at altitudes up to 50,000 feet. The
COMBAT EDGE equipment is used in conjunction with the G-suit
currently used in the Air Force. The aircraft anti-G valve senses the onset
of positive G conditions and provides pressurized engine bleed air at a
predetermined schedule to the G-suit and the oxygen regulator pressure
sensor. Regulated air and oxygen, at a predetermined schedule, are
supplied to the COMBAT EDGE equipment to provide vest inflation and
positive pressure breathing gas for breathing. The system provides PBG
at acceleration loads between +4G and +9G. This is accomplished by
equipping the oxygen regulator with a device to sense a pressure signal
from the high flow anti-G valve. At G loads above +4G, the input signal to
the oxygen regulator commands PBG to the vest, mask and helmet
bladder. If pressure breathing for both G and altitude are required, the
regulator provides the higher of the two pressure schedules. The
COMBAT EDGE equipment, used with the anti-G garment enhances the
M1/L1 aircrew straining maneuvers. M1/L1 aircrew straining maneuvers
are still required to be performed.

COMBAT EDGE Equipment

CSU-17/P Vest Assembly

There is a vest to be worn, similar in design to the G-Suit (pneumatic
bladder contained in a Nomex garment, with front zippered closure for
easy donning and doffing). The vest is worn on the upper torso of the
crewmember, over the standard flight suit, providing chest
counterpressure during PBG. A hole within the left-hand side zipper
enclosure provides for possible future use of a torso cooling system.

ACG-5 D - 24


Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_31.jpeg:
CRU-94/P Integrated Terminal Block (ITB)

The ITB serves as the central interface for breathing gas hoses, the vest
hose and the emergency oxygen hose. It also contains a pressure relief
valve that provides system overpressure protection for the aircrew
member when the vest is not being worn or has been inadvertently
disconnected. This prevents the operator from receiving excessive PBG
when not wearing the vest, even if the regulator switch is inadvertently
left in the PBG position. The ITB provides a man/aircraft interface
separation point during ground egress or ejection and is categorized as
manside equipment, although it is stowed in the aircraft. The ITB also
contains a split ring quick disconnect with a disconnect warning device,
which warns that the crewmember is disconnected from the oxygen
source. The CRU-94/P has an upper connector that goes to the oxygen
mask and a lower connector that goes to the vest. Expensive damage can
result if the crewmember attempts to connect his oxygen hose to the
wrong port.

KMU-511/P Helmet Modification Kit

The helmet used for COMBAT EDGE is the HGU-55/P with a modification
providing for automatic mask tensioning required for PBG. This
modification consists of an air bladder installed with hook and pile (velcro)
fasteners, between the thermoplastic liner (TPL) and the foam liner in the
rear, lower part of the helmet. A bladder supply hose passes through the
helmet shell and connects to the female side of a quick disconnect. This
connector allows separation of the helmet and mask for maintenance and
parachute descent procedures. The visors furnished with the helmet
modification kits are similar to the current visor, except that the lower
edge is reshaped to fit neatly against the PBG oxygen mask.

MBU-20/P Oxygen Mask Assembly

The oxygen mask is required for PBG. The oxygen mask contains
separate inhalation and exhalation valves. The separate valves require
the oxygen delivery hose to be offset from the center of the mask. The
inhalation and exhalation valves are interconnected by a compensation
tube. The compensation tube senses inhalation pressure and a portion is
directed to the underside of the exhalation valve plate. This compensating
pressure keeps the exhalation valve shut during inhalation and allows
PBA up to 50,000 feet.

CANOPY SYSTEM
Components

The canopy system consists of a large clamshell canopy (Figure D-19), a
hydraulic actuator mounted at the aft of the cockpit, a hydraulic
accumulator that allows operation prior to starting engines, and a
pyrotechnic system for emergency canopy jettison.

ACG-05-18

Figure D - 19.

Utility A powers the actuator that raises and lowers the canopy. This
actuator contains an accumulator that gives approximately three cycles of
the canopy without hydraulic power. A hand pump socket connector
exists in the nose wheelwell to operate the canopy without utility A
hydraulic pressure and with canopy accumulator hydraulic pressure
depleted. The socket connector is pumped using a 42” drive ratchet.

To operate the canopy without accumulator pressure, move the external
canopy control handle or one of the two internal handles to the UP or
DOWN position, and then operate the hand pump in the nose wheelwell.
To open the canopy from inside the cockpit with accumulator hydraulic
pressure depleted, place the handle in the UP position and then push up
on the canopy. A nitrogen charge (approximately 400 psi) in the canopy
actuator aids in opening the canopy manually.

ACG-5 D - 28

Controls

Internal Canopy Control Handle

The front and rear canopy control handles (Figure D-20) interconnect and
move in unison. Each has four positions:

UP

HOLD

Raises the canopy to maximum open. If selected from
LOCKED, the canopy unlocks, moves aft and then
rises.

Provides a hydraulic lock at any point in the cycle.
Should be used if canopy is to be left open. A leaky
accumulator may allow the canopy to creep.

Lowers the canopy full down and then forward against
the windscreen.

Mechanically locks the canopy. Causes a hydraulic
block, so the canopy must be against the windscreen
before it can be mechanically locked.

Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_36.jpeg:
When lowered, the canopy may bounce slightly as it reaches the sill. Once
the canopy contacts the windscreen, wait 10 seconds before locking it.
Latches on the frame engage fittings on the cockpit sill to secure the
canopy. When locked, the canopy seal inflates around the perimeter of the
canopy frame for cockpit pressurization. Ensure that the CAN UNLKD
light is on with handle in DN, and that the light is out when the handle is
moved full forward to LOCKED.

External Canopy Control Handle

There is a flush-mounted external control handle (Figure D-21) on the left
fuselage, below the canopy, which duplicates the internal control handle
functions. To access the handle, push the release button. To stow, push it
in until the retaining latch engages.

handle. The system incorporates a pyrotechnic canopy remover that is
independent of the normal system. It will safely jettison the canopy only
from the closed and locked position.

For internal jettison, depress the unlock button and rotate the handle aft.

Once fired, the handle locks in place and it (plus the initiator) must be
replaced. To use the external jettison handle, depress the release button
to open the access door and pull out the handle and its 8-foot lanyard.
Pulling the handle initiates canopy jettison.

Canopy Care

Improperly placed or unsecured items near the canopy remover may
actuate the canopy jettison bellcrank causing loss of canopy.

Do not place personal items, such as helmet and mask, on the windscreen
because the canopy and windscreen are easily scratched. Do not use the
canopy as a note pad.

BOARDING STEPS

From ground level, pressing the flush-mounted release button below and
in front of the left intake lowers the steps (Figure D-23). Observe the
printed warning because the steps free fall and can cause an injury.

For cockpit egress, there is a toe-actuated step release button behind a
spring-loaded door on the left side of the aircraft. A vertical arrow points
to the door.

on the bulkhead above and aft of the g-suit connection in the front cockpit.

If the steps lower in flight, some buffeting may occur at high speed. Check
the position indicator or have a wingman confirm steps position. The
steps have extended in high speed flight with no adverse effect. However,
reduce speed as soon as practical since structural failure of the steps will
probably FOD the left engine.

MALFUNCTIONS, WARNINGS & CAUTIONS
ECS Malfunction

MASTER CAUTION, ENGINE Caution and ECS Caution On MPD/MPCD

An ECS caution (Figure D-24) warns of avionics overtemperature (above
140°F) or low cooling airflow.

Make sure the temperature control switch is in AUTO and the air source
knob is in BOTH.

On the ground one engine may not provide adequate cooling airflow for
the avionics. If and when this happens, an immediate automatic avionics
shutdown occurs. The only indication of this condition will be blank
displays. Increasing the operating engine to 73% rpm should allow
normal avionics operation within 2 minutes. If normal operation does not
resume, it may be necessary to start the second engine.

ACG-5 D - 36


Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_43.jpeg:
If both engines are running and the ECS caution remains on after

1 minute, the system may not be getting bleed air from both engines. Try
to isolate the bleed source by rotating the air source knob through all
positions while the ground crew checks exhaust ports. Once the operating
source of the ECS air is determined, advance the throttle of the operating
bleed air source to 77% and turn off all nonessential avionics. Cycle the
throttle of the nonoperating bleed air source from idle to 78% rpm and
cycle the air source knob through all positions.

If the ECS caution light remains on after 10 minutes, shut down either
engine. This should automatically shut down much of the avionics
equipment including the HUD and the MPDP. If automatic shutdown
does not occur, shut off all avionics equipment except the UHF to protect
the equipment. Avionics that cannot be turned off will continue to be heat
damaged.

In flight, maintain moderate airspeeds and rpm if the ECS caution is on
because very low or high engine rpm can degrade ECS operation. Shut
down high cooling demand systems first, such as the radar, ICS, TEWS
and selected MPD/MPCDs. Nonessential avionics should be turned off for
their own protection. If diversion of all avionics cooling airflow via the
EMERG VENT handle is unsuccessful, turn the cabin temperature control
switch to OFF. This switches avionics cooling to ram air, but temperature
will continue to be system monitored. Optimum ram air cooling is
obtained at 400 knots and 15,000 feet. When landing single engine,
automatic avionics shut down will occur at touchdown or on roll out. If it
does, the HUD and cockpit displays go blank, and UHF 1 is inoperative. If
you land with both engines operating and an ECS caution, consider
shutting down an engine to get the automatic avionics shut down.

NOTE

ECS turbine bearing disintegration can be related to an ECS light
and/or smoke and fumes. The malfunction usually causes a high

pitched whine that rises as rpm increases, and can result in floor
vibration. The ECS turbine is shut down by placing the cabin
temperature control switch or the air source knob to OFF.

Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_44.jpeg:
Display Flow Low Caution

A DISPLAY FLOW LOW caution (Figure D-25) during dual engine ground
operation indicates low cooling air flow to the cockpit displays. Turning
off all nonessential displays helps protect them from heat damage. The
mission must be aborted and the condition corrected.

During single engine operation, increasing the rpm above idle will
extinguish the light if the ECS is operating normally. If it does not, abort
the mission.

A DISPLAY FLOW LOW while airborne requires turning the ICS OFF to
increase the cooling air supply to the cockpit displays. Nonessential
displays should be turned off for their own protection. The remote map
reader (RMR) and MPCDs should be turned off as soon as possible since
they are the most sensitive to heat and they have no overheat protection.
Turning the emergency vent handle increases display cooling airflow, but
dumps cabin pressure; therefore altitude should be below 25,000 MSL
before turning the emergency vent handle.

MASTER CAUTION, ENGINE Caution and R BLEED AIR/L BLEED AIR
Caution On MPD/MPCD

This caution (Figure D-26) displays when a bleed air leak occurs in an
engine bay or air flowing from a primary heat exchanger becomes too hot.
This creates the potential for a serious fire or excessive ECS temperature
and can cause confusion and misinterpretation. Prompt action is
required. With a left engine bleed air leak, selecting right engine air
source closes the left bleed air valve. If the caution remains on, pull the
left throttle to idle to reduce bleed air flow from that engine. If both
cautions appear, turn the air source knob off.

Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_50.jpeg:
Cockpit Pressurization/Extreme Temperature Malfunctions

Cockpit Pressurization Malfunctions on the Ground

Aircrews should check to ensure the cockpit is not overpressurized (cockpit
pressure altitude is lower than actual field elevation). If this occurs, the
pilot should turn the emergency vent handle to dump cabin pressure.
Otherwise, the canopy may separate from the aircraft if opened before
cockpit pressure is dumped.

Loss of Cabin Pressure

If loss of cabin pressure occurs, select 100% oxygen, descend to the lowest
practical altitude (25,000 feet maximum), check the emergency vent
handle in and vertical, and land as soon as practical. This situation may
be reportable as a physiological incident and the aircrew may need to see
a flight surgeon.

Extreme Cockpit Temperature

If this should occur, attempt to control the temperature in manual. If you
cannot control the temperature in auto or manual and it becomes
excessive, you should turn and pull the emergency vent handle below
18,000 feet. If the temperature is excessively cold, consider a descent to
warmer air. If the temperature is excessively hot, consider a climb to
cooler air and/or decelerate to a slower speed. (Optimum ram air cooling
is obtained at 400 knots and 15,000 feet).

Canopy Warnings/Cautions

CANOPY UNLOCKED Warning Light

This light (Figure D-31) illuminates whenever the canopy is unlocked or
when the canopy actuated initiator lanyard (“pigtail”) is disconnected.
The pigtail is located on the left side of the aft cockpit rear bulkhead.

For a ground malfunction, relock the canopy (cycle the control handle to
DN and then back to locked). If not remedied, the “pigtail” might be
disconnected. Give the jet back to maintenance.

The recommended corrective procedure for an in-flight canopy malfunction
is to slow below 250 knots. Dump cabin pressure (below FL 250) by
turning the emergency vent handle. Make sure the canopy control handle
is full forward.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL SYSTEM (ECS)

ECS Description

The ECS provides conditioned air and pressurization for the cockpit,
avionics, windshield anti-fog, anti-ice, anti-G, canopy seal and the fuel
system. The system uses extracted air, or bleed air, from both engines for
normal operations. The source of the bleed air is the thirteenth stage of
the engine compressor. This high pressure air is extremely hot, but
through a series of components, conditioned air is delivered to the various
systems. Either engine can provide enough air to operate the ECS, and
ram air cooling is also available should normal ECS fail. Should ECS
cooling air fail and the air source knob or cockpit temperature switch be
placed to OFF, ram air is automatically provided to the avionics for
cooling.

Text from ACG-5_Environmental_Control_System_Canopy__Steps_page_8.jpeg:
The primary heat exchanger initially cools the bleed air, decreasing the
air temperature from the 1000°F to the 200°F range. The compressor
compresses the air and then the secondary heat exchanger cools it again.
A high pressure water separator (HPWS) removes the water by using a
cyclone effect to extract moisture. This dry air is put through a cooling
turbine where rapid expansion drops the temperature further. The
conditioned air is now ready for use. A few systems deviate from this
track. Fuel pressurization (which has its own additional heat exchanger)
and windshield anti-ice and canopy seal (which use hot air), all branch off
after the primary heat exchanger and before the compressor.
The ECS system provides cool air to the following:

¢ Cockpit air vents

e Windshield anti-fog

e Multipurpose display/multipurpose color displays

e Upfront controls

e Forward avionics bays (left and right)

e Internal countermeasures set

e Radar waveguides (throughout the aircraft)

Power Sources

The system uses four interchangeable hydraulic pump assemblies driven
by the left and right AMADs. One pump is provided for each of the PC
systems and two pumps are provided for the utility system. Figure D-4
shows that the left AMAD drives the PC1 and left utility pumps. The
right AMAD drives the PC2 and right utility pumps.

The PC1 and PC2 pumps pressurize their own separate reservoirs.
Pressure from the left and right utility pumps are combined to pressurize
one common utility reservoir.

The PC1/2 and left utility pumps operate at a pressure of 3000 +250 psi;
the right utility pump operates at 2775 +225 psi. The slightly lower
pressure for the right pump reduces resonation between the pumps during
dual pump operation. Crew members use the difference in pressure to
help verify the operation of both pumps through a single gauge.

Notice in Figure D-4 that each PC system is further divided into two
separate circuits (A and B), and that the utility system is divided into
three separate circuits (A, B and non-RLS). In all of the circuits except
UTL non-RLS, the reservoir level sensing (RLS) system functions to
isolate circuit leaks.

Figure D-5 shows that it is the B circuits of the PC1 and PC2 systems that
are primarily responsible for powering the left and right flight controls,
respectively. The A circuit of each system crosses over to share the
operating load of the opposite stabilator through a dual system actuator.
If one PC system is totally lost, the opposite PC system continues to
provide stabilator control.

Figure D-5 also shows how the utility system provides backup for both PC
systems. UTL A backs up the left wing (aileron and flap), while UTL B
performs the same backup function for the right wing. UTL non-RLS
provides a backup for the tail (stabilator and rudders), but does not power
ailerons and flaps. Note that UTL A also powers a function known as the
control stick boost/pitch compensator (CSBPC)—an important part of the
flight control “feel” system. You will learn more about the CSBPC in the
course on flight controls, but for now, suffice it to say it is important
enough to require a backup source of power in case the UTL A circuit is
lost. That backup source of power is PC2 A.

Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_12.jpeg:
Reservoir Level Sensing

Figure D-6 depicts how the RLS system functions when a leak occurs.
When the fluid level of a reservoir begins to drop, circuit A is shut off in an
attempt to isolate the leak. If the leak is in circuit A, no further action
occurs. If the leak is in circuit B, the reservoir level continues to fall,
causing RLS to restore circuit A and shut off circuit B. The hydraulic fluid
level stabilizes and the leak is successfully isolated.

The non-RLS circuit of the utility system, however, has no RLS protection.
If this circuit were to develop a leak, RLS would respond as described,
first shutting off circuit A, then restoring A and shutting off B. Since this
leak cannot be isolated, if the flight is continued, the fluid level will
continue to drop until the reservoir is depleted and complete utility failure
occurs. (Cockpit indications of this failure are UTL A followed by UTL B,
followed by L PUMP and R PUMP caution.)

Return Pressure Sensing (RPS) Switchover Valves

The F-15E incorporates a number of RPS switchover valves, which are an
important part of the hydraulic system because they enable one system or
circuit to serve as backup for another. RPS switchover valves, depicted in
Figure D-5, monitor the hydraulic pressure in the primary circuits. As
long as that pressure is within limits, everything functions normally.

If the pressure drops in a primary circuit, the RPS switchover valve
detects it and initiates the sequence for switching over to the backup
system. This loss of pressure could be due to a leak or loss of a pump. To
avoid loss of the backup, the RPS tests the line downstream of its location
to see if pressure can be maintained. This is done by initially allowing
only a low volume flow of fluid from the backup circuit. If the line
downstream is not damaged or leaking, the return pressure remains
within limits and the valve completes the switchover to a full volume flow
of the backup system. If pressure cannot be maintained, the valve does
not allow a full switchover, but retains a low volume flow. This means the
backup system will also leak, but at a reduced rate, and the backup
system RLS will kick in and shut down the affected circuit.

HYDRAULIC INDICATORS
Cockpit Pressure Indicators

Three hydraulic pressure indicators are located in the upper right corner
of the main instrument panel in the front cockpit (Figure D-7). These
indicators display UTIL, PC1 and PC2 hydraulic system pressure. Notice
that although the utility system has two pumps, there is only one pressure
indicator. A main generator is required to power the indicators.

Figure D - 9.

a. Hydraulic pressure indicators - Display pressure in the
respective PC1, PC2 and/or utility hydraulic systems.

b. HYD caution light - Comes on when any hydraulic malfunction
is detected in order to direct your attention to hydraulic
indicators and the MPD/MPCD.

c. MPD/MPCD caution displays - Indicate the specific system that
has malfunctioned.

Reservoir level sensing (RLS) - Protects the hydraulic system by
isolating leaks. It works on the principle that a leak developed in the
circuit will cause the reservoir level to drop.

UTL A would power the left aileron and flap while the UTL non-RLS
would power the left rudder and the PC1 B side of the dual actuator
for the left stabilator. PC2 A would continue to power its half of the
left stabilator.

UTL A and UTLB would power the left and right ailerons and flaps
respectively, and UTL non-RLS would power both the left and right
stabilators and rudders. Although only one-half of the stabilator dual
actuators would be powered, this is sufficient to provide complete
control throughout the flight envelope.

ACG-6 D-12


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_19.jpeg:
UTL non-RLS would power the left rudder and half of the left
stabilator dual actuator, while PC2 A would continue to power its
half of the left stabilator dual actuator. However, both primary and
backup systems to the left wing have been lost and you should not
lower the flaps. Any attempt to do so would result in a split flap
configuration. Note that an identical situation would apply to the
right side if, instead, you lost the UTL B circuit in combination with
the PC2 B circuit.

You have lost one-half of the left dual stab actuator, and you have
completely lost the CSBPC function. Although losing half of a dual
stab actuator does not present a problem, losing the CSBPC function
degrades aircraft handling characteristics. This is, therefore, one of
the most serious hydraulic malfunctions.

UTILITY SUBSYSTEMS

In addition to providing a backup source of power for the two PC systems,
the utility hydraulic system is responsible for powering all other hydraulic
systems in the aircraft (Figure D-10). The UTL A circuit powers the
majority of these hydraulic subsystems and the UTL B circuit provides
power to recharge the JFS accumulators, allowing UTL B to back up the
landing gear, brakes and nosewheel steering through the JFS
accumulators. JFS accumulators are also used to start the JFS.

Figure D - 10. Utility Hydraulic System.

Landing Gear

The landing gear is one of the major subsystems powered by utility
hydraulics. It is electrically controlled by a switch in the front cockpit and
hydraulically operated through the UTL A circuit. An electronic
weight-on-wheels switch, located on each landing gear strut, prevents the
gear from being retracted on the ground.

The landing gear handle, once raised, moves into a detent to prevent

inadvertent lowering under G-loading. To lower the gear, the handle
must be moved to the right (out of the detent) and down.

ACG-6 D-14


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_21.jpeg:
Three green lights in each cockpit provide down-and-locked indications for
each of the gear. A red light in the gear handle and a red UNSAFE light
in the RCP provide an indication anytime the gear is not in the position
called for by the gear handle. However, the red light is not independent of
the three green lights in the gear down position. The green and red
operate from the same indicator switch on each gear overcenter locking
bar. The red light will go out when the third green comes on. You should
not get three green and a red light nor less than three green with no red
light unless a bulb is out. The bottom line is that a lack of a red light is
not an indication of safe gear down. During the retract cycle, this light
does not go out until all gear doors are up and locked.

A redundant gear down sensor tells the main gear doors to close after the
gear is overcenter locked. Closed main gear doors are an indication of
main gear safe using the normal gear system.
In addition to the position indicators, another guard against gear up
landings is provided in the form of a landing gear warning tone. If all
gear are not down and locked, the tone is activated 10 seconds after the
gear handle is placed down. The volume of the tone is not adjustable. It
also comes on in the landing regime with

° altitude less than 10,000 feet MSL,

e airspeed less than 200 KCAS,

° greater than 250 fpm descent rate and

e —_ gear handle is not down.
These four parameters must be met to activate the tone. Correcting one

silences the tone. Since the tone requires inputs from the air data
computer (ADC), the tone defaults to the ON position if the ADC fails.

D-15 ACG-6


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_22.jpeg:
There is, however, a tone silence button mounted next to the gear handle
which allows the pilot an override feature. A landing gear control circuit
breaker is available to the pilot on the lower portion of the FCP main
instrument panel, next to the air conditioning vent. Ifthe circuit breaker
pops, the warning tone is inoperative; however, the position indicators still
operate normally and the red light will illuminate in the handle even if
the gear is up and locked.

Pulling one of the emergency landing gear handles located on the left
main instrument panel in each cockpit will lower the landing gear in an
emergency (Figure D-11). Pulling the handle interrupts normal hydraulic
and electrical power to the gear and the JFS accumulator pressure
provides emergency hydraulic pressure to unlock the gear and gear doors.
The gear will gravity fall to the down position; yawing the aircraft can
assist in this process to ensure the overcenter downlock is engaged to hold
the gear in the locked position. Even if the gear are all unlocked, they
may not fully extend due to a hydraulic lock. Emergency gear extension
also operates a bypass valve to release all hydraulic pressure and allow
full gravity extension. The gear doors will remain open when using the
emergency system.

The emergency landing gear handle can be reset from the front cockpit
only, by rotating the handle 45° clockwise before pushing in. After
resetting, and with UTL A available, the doors will shut.

Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_23.jpeg:
Flaps

The F-15E incorporates two-position (up or down) trailing edge flaps with
30° of travel. A switch in the front cockpit electrically controls these flaps
and they are hydraulically operated. The switch is formed in the shape of
a small flap and is located on the outboard side of the FCP throttle
quadrant. Each cockpit contains two flap indicator lights (Figure D-12).
The upper light is yellow (amber) and indicates that the flaps are in
transit. The lower light is green, indicating that the flaps are full down.
Both lights extinguished indicate that the flaps are full up.

ACG-06-12

Figure D - 12. Flap Indicators.

A flap blowup switch protects the flaps from structural damage if they are
inadvertently left down. The blowup switch automatically retracts the
flaps at 250 knots and allows them to extend automatically at no less than
230 knots, provided the flap switch remains down.

D-17 ACG-6


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_24.jpeg:
Wheel Brakes

UTL A hydraulically powers the wheel brakes and rudder pedal toe
pressure operates them. The braking force applied at the main wheels is
directly proportional to the amount of pedal displacement.

A two-position electrical toggle switch on the right side of the FCP lower
main instrument panel activates the holding brake (Figure D-13). When
switched to the ON position, the switch activates a valve to apply a full
3000 psi of hydraulic pressure to the brakes. DO NOT PLACE THE
HOLDING BRAKE TO ON WHILE MOVING. The switch is electrically
held in the ON position and trips off automatically whenever the throttle
is advanced above idle, weight is off the gear, or electrical power is
interrupted. A malfunction in the electrical system can release the brakes
without turning the switch off when advancing the throttles. Should this
occur, the brakes might be on when landing with the throttles at idle. The
proper procedure is to turn the holding brake off rather than depend on
the throttles.

ACG-6 D-18


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_25.jpeg:
The wheel brakes incorporate an antiskid feature which is capable of
detecting an impending skid and regulates brake pressure to maintain a
controlled (rolling) skid. Antiskid is selectable through a three-position
electrical toggle switch located on the FCP MISC panel, forward of the
throttles (Figure D-14).

ANTI SKID

ACG-06-14

Figure D - 14. Antiskid Switch.

The NORM (forward) position of the antiskid switch selects antiskid
protection when the gear handle is down. This position enables a
touchdown protection circuit which disables brakes until both main
wheels spin up to 50 knots or, if above 50 knots at touchdown (such as
after a bounce), 5 seconds after touchdown. This feature prevents blown
tires if brakes are inadvertently applied during touchdown. The spin up
(50 knots) signal is also used to disable the aileron rudder interconnect
(ARID) and provide better crosswind control during the landing roll.

Failure of the antiskid function causes a caution display on the
MPD/MPCD and illumination of the MASTER CAUTION light with the
gear handle down. If this occurs, the PULSER position should be selected
to ensure ARI disconnect.

D-19 ACG-6


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_26.jpeg:
A malfunction of certain relays or a left main gear down indicator switch
can cause the antiskid warning to illuminate in flight with the gear
handle up and may also show an unsafe left main gear with the gear
down.

The PULSER (middle) position of the antiskid switch causes repeated
interruption of applied brake pressure, and should be used at high speeds
(above 30 knots) if the antiskid has malfunctioned. PULSER was
designed to reduce tire wear and the probability of tire blowout from
locked wheels. However, a blown tire is the likely outcome of braking
with PULSER and all F-15E bases have reported blown tires as a result of
using PULSER. An approach-end cable engagement should be considered.

Another difference is that the aircraft cannot be completely stopped in the
PULSER mode. To stop the aircraft, select the OFF (aft) position when
the aircraft is slowed to normal taxi speed (greater than 30 knots).
Selecting OFF provides manual brakes (i.e., no antiskid protection).

ACG-6 D - 20


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_27.jpeg:
Emergency Brakes

An emergency brake/steering handle is located in each cockpit in the lower
center of the main instrument panel (Figure D-15). When pulled, the JFS
accumulator pressure provides emergency hydraulic pressure to the
brakes. With UTL B operational, emergency hydraulic fluid is
continuously replenished and the accumulators stay charged. However,
even with UTL B inoperative, sufficient reserve fluid is normally available
to bring the aircraft to a stop but the brakes should not be continuously
pumped, as fluid is lost to return lines as the brakes are released.

EMERG BK
“| ADJ

ACG-06-15

Figure D - 15. Emergency Brake/Steering Handle.

Antiskid and PULSER brakes are not available with the emergency brake
handle pulled. If UTL A is operational, resetting the handle restores
normal brakes, and therefore, antiskid/PULSER operation.

CAUTION

Pulling the emergency brake handle
above 70 knots increases the possibility of
blown tires.

Do not pull the handle above 70 knots unless immediately required for
braking or directional control.

D-21 ACG-6


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_28.jpeg:
Nose Gear Steering

Nose gear steering is manually selected with rudder pedal displacement
and hydraulically operated by the UTL A circuit. It is engaged and
operational anytime weight is on the nose gear. Full time nose gear
steering provides between 15-30° of turning authority. For a 45°
maneuvering range of turning authority, depress and hold the nosewheel
steering button on the FCP stick grip.

To select the nose gear steering disconnect feature, depress and hold the
paddle switch on either stick grip. With the disengage feature selected,
the nosewheel becomes free swiveling (360°) and directional control must
be maintained by using differential braking. When the paddle switch is
released, the system does not reengage if the nose gear has rotated more
than approximately 56°. However, if the nose gear steering button is
engaged with the nose gear rotated beyond 45°, the nose gear is
immediately driven back to the 45° position. When centering action
reduces the angle below 45°, the NGS system reengages.

Emergency nose gear steering is available by pulling the emergency
brake/steering handle in either cockpit. JFS accumulator pressure then
provides emergency hydraulic pressure for steering when the handle is
pulled. Both of the normal steering ranges are available; however, the
disengage feature of the paddle switch is not. With the emergency
brake/steering handle pulled, depressing the paddle switch interrupts
UTLA pressure (if present) to the nose gear steering and prevents a
sluggish crossover to emergency pressure. When operating with the
handle pulled, the aircraft should not be taxied if the JFS LOW caution is
observed. If UTLB is available, the emergency hydraulic fluid will be
replenished and keep the JFS accumulators fully charged. If UTL A is
operational, resetting the handle restores normal system operation.

Do not pull the emergency handle above 70 knots unless needed for
immediate directional control, as a possibility of blown tires exists.

Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_29.jpeg:
Speed Brake

The speed brake is located on top of the fuselage just aft of the canopy. It
is hydraulically operated using UTL A and electrically controlled b a
three-position switch on the right throttle of each cockpit (Figure D-16).

ACG-06-16

Figure D - 16. Speed Brake Switch.

The forward position on the switch retracts the speed brake and the aft
position extends it. A manually selected center position (FCP) stops the
speed brake at any intermediate position between full open or closed. The
FCP switch must be in the center position for the speed brake to remain in
the position selected by the RCP; if not, the speed brake returns to the
position commanded by the FCP when the RCP switch is released. The
RCP switch is spring loaded to the HOLD position. If the RCP switch is
held in the extend or retract position, it overrides the FCP switch position.

Air loads at high speeds (approximately 450 KCAS) may prevent the
speed brake from fully opening, but speed brake extension at any speed
does not adversely affect aircraft handling characteristics. An AOA
interrupt feature prevents extension of the speed brake above 25 units
AOA. If extended, and the AOA is increased above 25 units, the speed
brake automatically retracts to prevent airflow interference to the
stabilators, and then reopens when AOA is reduced below 25 units
provided either switch is still in the aft position.

The speed brake defaults to the closed position with either electrical or
UTLA hydraulic failure. In the unlikely event that it should ever fail in
the open position, pulling the speed brake circuit breaker, located on the
center pedestal in the front cockpit, removes electrical power and allows it
to retract.

Arresting Hook

A two-position electric switch on the left subpanel in each cockpit controls
the arresting hook (Figure D-17).

ACG-06-17

Figure D - 17. Arresting Hook Switch.

Selecting the DOWN position of the switch electrically unlocks the hook
and allows it to gravity fall to the down position. A hydraulic dashpot
assists in lowering and holds the hook down to prevent skipping on the
runway. The MASTER CAUTION light and HOOK caution illuminate
whenever the hook is not in the up-and-locked position. The MASTER
CAUTION may be reset, but the HOOK caution remains on the
MPD/MPCD. The UP position of the switch allows the hook to be
retracted and locked, using UTL A hydraulic pressure. The hook comes
down in 2 seconds and retracts in 10 seconds.

AFI 11-2F-15EV3, Chapter 7 requires that the hook be lowered for an
abort if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the runway. The
4th FW Inflight Guide (page H-1) also lists a requirement to lower the
hook when aborting above 100 KCAS.

D - 25 ACG-6


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_32.jpeg:
ANSWERS
1. The UTLA circuit powers the majority of the hydraulic subsystems.

2. The UTLB circuit charges the JFS accumulators by providing
emergency hydraulic fluid. The JFS accumulators, in turn, provide a
backup pressure to lower the landing gear and operate the nose gear
steering and brakes.

3. The landing gear warning tone will sound 10 seconds after the gear
handle is lowered if the gear are not down and locked. It also sounds
anytime the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL, less than 200 knots,
greater than 250 fpm decent rate and if the gear handle is not down.
If the ADC fails, the tone defaults to the ON position. The tone may
be silenced anytime with the gear warning tone silence button (FCP)
or the voice warning/tone silence button in either cockpit.

4. Normal antiskid regulates brake pressure to maintain a controlled
(rolling) skid, whereas PULSER operation repeatedly interrupts
applied brake pressure. The aircraft cannot be completely stopped in
the PULSER mode, and pulser braking has a high possibility of
blown tires.

5. Nose gear steering is disengaged and the nosewheel becomes free
swivelling through 360°.

6. The speed brake will automatically retract whenever AOA exceeds 25
units. It will open again automatically when AOA is reduced below

25 units, if a speed brake switch is still in the aft (open) position.

7. The HOOK caution will be displayed anytime the hook is not up and
locked.

HYDRAULIC SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONS

Thanks to reservoir level sensing, return pressure sensing and built-in
redundancy, hydraulic system malfunctions normally do not present a
serious emergency. However, as with any major system malfunction, they
are cause to terminate your mission and land as soon as practicable
because hydraulic system malfunctions may be an early sign of a more
serious problem. There are only three hydraulic system malfunctions
which require you to complete emergency procedures actions; however,
you should refer to the color coded Hydraulic Flow Diagram - Flight
Controls in your checklist (reproduced in black and white in Figure D-18)
whenever a hydraulic malfunction is detected.

Caution Lights

A major category caution light for the hydraulic system is located in each
cockpit (Figures D-19 and D-20). The light is labeled HYD in both
cockpits. It illuminates anytime a malfunction is detected in a hydraulic
system component and simultaneously illuminates the MASTER
CAUTION light in the FCP and RCP. Resetting the MASTER CAUTION
light in the FCP will not extinguish the HYD caution light or any
associated caution on the MPD/MPCD. Other related caution lights may
illuminate depending on the systems affected.

MPD/MPCD Caution Displays

In addition to the major category caution lights in both cockpits, a specific
system caution is displayed on the right MPD (FCP) or the right MPCD
(RCP) to help you determine what type of malfunction has taken place.

For example, when an RLS valve actuates to shut off a circuit, the affected
circuit is displayed as a caution on the MPD/MPCD; i.e., PC1 A, PC1 B,
PC2 A, PC2 B, UTL A, or UTLB. (Note the PC1 A caution shown in
Figure D-21.)

When a utility hydraulic pump has failed (or output pressure is low), an

L PUMP or R PUMP caution, as appropriate, is displayed. PC pump
failure (or low pressure) is indicated by displaying both PC A and B circuit
cautions, as well as low or zero pressure on the respective PC hydraulic
pressure gauge; since there is only one pump per PC system, a separate
pump caution is not required.

ACG-06-21

Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_38.jpeg:
Although combination or multiple failures of different hydraulic circuits or
systems is not common, they may occur if the aircraft becomes damaged or
if a hydraulic malfunction has occurred and a subsequent emergency
requires an engine to be shut down. Therefore, with any of the following
malfunctions, more cautions or warnings may be displayed than those
listed.

Single Circuit Failure of a PC System

Illumination of the MASTER CAUTION and HYD caution lights indicates
this malfunction. In addition, the appropriate circuit caution displays on
the MPD/MPCD. There are no changes in the hydraulic pressure
readings.

Due to RLS protection and switchover valves, there are no adverse effects
with this malfunction; however, you should terminate your mission.

Total Failure of a PC System

Illumination of the MASTER CAUTION and HYD caution lights indicates
this malfunction. The appropriate PC A and PC B cautions display on the
MPD/MPCD, and the appropriate PC pressure reading is low or zero.

Due to system redundancy, there are no adverse effects; however, you
should terminate your mission.

Single Utility Pump Failure

Illumination of the MASTER CAUTION and HYD caution lights also
indicates this failure. Either L PUMP or R PUMP displays on the
MPD/MPCD. If the right pump has failed, you see no changes on the
hydraulic pressure gauges, but if the left pump has failed, you may see the
utility pressure indicating slightly less than normal (since you are reading
the 2775 +225 psi produced by the right pump).

Since only one pump is required to operate the utility system, there are no
adverse effects; however, you may notice a significant temporary pressure
drop and slower than normal operation of utility systems. Terminate your
mission.

ACG-6 D - 32


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_39.jpeg:
Double Utility Pump Failure (refer to checklist procedure - Total
Utility Failure)

There are several ways to lose total utility pressure: loss of both utility
pumps, one pump and the opposite AMAD or engine, or a leak in the
non-RLS system. You should land as soon as possible, refer to the
Landing Gear Emergency Extension checklist and consider an
approach-end arrestment. Pull the emergency brake/steering handle after
the nosewheel is on the ground. Remember the 70-knot caution to prevent
the possibility of blown tires. Note that this procedure is basically the
same as the UTL A circuit failure below. In an attempt to keep the JFS
accumulators fully charged for emergency braking, it is prudent to
consider lowering the gear when UTL A is available during a non-RLS
leak.

Utility A Circuit Failure (refer to checklist procedure)

This malfunction is the most serious single system hydraulic malfunction
because of the number of systems rendered inoperative. The MASTER
CAUTION and HYD caution lights illuminate and you should see the UTL
A caution displayed on the MPD/MPCD. There should be no change in the
pressure readings. Failure of one of the systems powered by UTL A, such
as the radar antenna or speed brake, may alert you to the malfunction.
With this malfunction, you lose all systems normally powered by UTL A.
These include the left ramp, which moves full up due to air loads (there is
a possibility of compressor stalls at high speeds and/or high angles of
attack), normal landing gear lowering and retraction, slipway door, nose
gear steering, wheel brakes and antiskid, speed brake, radar antenna,
canopy and the ability to raise the hook.

Utility A circuit failure is a checklist emergency and requires you to read
three separate checklists, including UTL A Malfunction, Landing Gear
Emergency Extension, and Approach-End Arrestment. You are then
required to pull the emergency brake/steering handle after the nosewheel
is on the ground.

Utility B Circuit Failure
The MASTER CAUTION illuminates (the HYD light remains on from the

preceding UTL A), then UTL A changes (RLS) to the UTL B caution
display on the MPD/MPCD. There is no change in pressure readings.

You lose the gun drive. The JFS accumulators will no longer be recharged
if used, and the right ramp raises to the full-up position (R INLET light
on) due to air loads.

As long as you do not need to use the gun on the way home, there are no
adverse effects with this malfunction. Terminate the mission and land as
soon as practicable.

Combination Failures

Due to the number of circuits and systems involved, any number of
combination failures may be experienced. You may use the hydraulic
system diagrams to determine what the indications and effects of these

may be, but here are a few of the most serious.

UTL A and PC2 A Failure (refer to checklist procedure)

The MASTER CAUTION and HYD caution lights illuminate and the
UTLA, PC2 A, LINLET, PITCH RATIO and ROLL RATIO cautions
display on the MPD/MPCD. The pressure gauges do not indicate any
change unless total loss of Utility or PC2 causes the circuit failure. In
addition to losing all the systems covered under UTL A failure, you lose
the CSBPC function; this is what causes the PITCH RATIO and ROLL
RATIO cautions to be displayed. This is a very important part of your
flight control system and its loss degrades aircraft controllability.

UTL A/PC2 A is the third malfunction which requires a checklist
response. It is a serious combination malfunction because of the loss of all
the UTL A systems, combined with aircraft stability problems. If you are
supersonic when this occurs, you should carefully slow to subsonic before
completing checklist procedures. Terminate the mission and land as soon
as practicable. Checklist response is basically the same asin UTLA
failure, but you are required to perform a controllability check prior to
commencing your approach.

UTL A and PC1 B Failure

The MASTER CAUTION and HYD caution lights illuminate, accompanied
by at least the UTL A, L INLET and PC1 B cautions on the MPD/MPCD.
(Remember, PC1 A must have been seen before the RLS switched to

PC1 B).

ACG-6 D - 34


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_41.jpeg:
Again, you have all the effects of losing UTL A, but if you refer to the
hydraulic diagram, you find that you have also lost both primary and
backup actuation for the left aileron and flap. Any attempt to lower the
flaps results in a split flap configuration.

NOTE: Switchover valves have been known to fail. It is a good idea
anytime you lose a PC B circuit to check if the aileron is working prior to
lowering the flaps. If the switchover valve has failed, a split flap condition
will not show on the MPDs, but you will have one.

You are required to complete all three checklists in the UTL A failure,
plus make a no flap approach and landing. Terminate your mission and

land as soon as practicable.

UTLB and PC2 B Failure

The MASTER CAUTION and HYD caution lights illuminate, along with
UTLB, R INLET and PC2 B cautions on the MPD/MPCD (preceded by
UTL A, L INLET and PC2 A until RLS occurs). You lose the same
systems covered under UTL B failure, and control of the right aileron and
flap.

Terminate the mission and land as soon as practicable. Plan a no flap
approach and landing. Do not attempt to lower the flaps, because this

also results in a split flap configuration.

Leak in Stabilator/Rudder Area

With this malfunction, the MASTER CAUTION and HYD lights come on
with one of the PC A circuit cautions displayed on the MPD/MPCD. The
PC A caution goes out and the same system’s PC B caution replaces it.
The light sequence is due, at first, to the functioning of the RLS system
(PC A followed by PC B cautions). When the PC B caution illuminates
due to zero pressure in that circuit, the switchover valve activates and
depletion of the utility system commences. Since the leak is in the aft
area, the non-RLS is the backup system and complete utility failure is
imminent. Follow checklist procedures for total utility system failure.
Terminate the mission and land as soon as possible. The possibility of a
slow leak is a good reason never to delay returning to base if any
hydraulic circuit is shut down. If practical, the landing gear should be
lowered while UTL B caution is displayed (UTL A restored until total UTL
failure occurs) to preserve fully charged JFS accumulators.

Compounded Emergencies

Any number of combinations of emergencies exist that could fail a whole
PC and/or the utility system. Therefore, it is important to understand the
chart in the checklist and determine what is lost. For example, a right
engine failure (that is not windmilling sufficiently to provide hydraulics)
or a right AMAD failure combined with a left utility pump would cause
the loss of all PC2 and all utility pressure. You would lose the CSBPC and
have no flaps on the right wing. PC1 A and PC1 B would be the only
circuits operating but you could still fly. You would not only need to look
at the total utility failure but also at UTL A and PC2 A failures which
refer you to still more checklists.

Now, let us shift our thoughts to the effects of hydraulic system failures on
utility subsystems.

Loss of Directional Control (refer to checklist)

Release the brakes and pull the emergency brake/steering handle.
Depress and hold the paddle switch to prevent sluggish crossover to
emergency hydraulic pressure.

Loss of Brakes (refer to checklist)
Put the hook down in case a cable engagement becomes necessary.

If stopping distance is not critical, turn the antiskid switch to PULSER or
OFF (below 30 KCAS), as appropriate, and retry the brakes. If braking is
not restored, release the brakes and pull the emergency brake/steering
handle, depress and hold the paddle switch and reapply the brakes.

If stopping distance is critical, pull the emergency brake/steering handle
first. Be aware that pulling the handle at speeds above 70 knots can
result in blowing one or both main tires.

Antiskid Malfunctions (refer to checklist)
With landing gear unsafe indications or circuit breaker problems, or
whenever the ANTISKID caution is displayed, assume that the antiskid is

inoperative and place the switch to PULSER (airborne, landing roll,
aborts) or OFF (at taxi speeds of less than 30 knots) as appropriate.

ACG-6 D - 36


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_43.jpeg:
There is no ARI when airborne with the landing gear handle is down
when in PULSER or OFF. Also, remember that you cannot completely
stop the aircraft using PULSER, so turn the switch to OFF when below 30
KCAS on landing roll and for taxi. Using PULSER to stop increases the
probability of blown tires.

Blown Tire During Takeoff (refer to checklist)

If takeoff is discontinued, abort and place the antiskid to PULSER or OFF
as required.

If takeoff is continued, remain below 250 knots and do not retract the
landing gear or flaps (damage from tire debris is possible). Refer to
Landing with Known Blown Tire procedure.

Landing Gear Fails to Retract (refer to checklist)

Anytime the light in the gear handle and/or the red UNSAFE light in the
RCP remain illuminated after gear retraction, remain below 250 knots
and check the circuit breaker in the FCP. Place the gear handle back
down, and if the gear lowers normally, you may elect to attempt another
retraction. If you still have an unsafe indication, place the gear back
down, remain below 250 knots, burn down fuel and land. The usual cause
of this malfunction is landing gear door sequencing, and recycling is an
accepted practice in the F-15.

Speed Brake Failure (refer to checklist)

Pulling the circuit breaker in the FCP removes electrical power and the
speed brake should retract.

Flap Malfunction

Flap malfunction is not a checklist procedure. Ifa split flap condition
exists, attempt to raise the flaps or exceed 250 KCAS to blow them up.
Remember not to attempt to lower flaps with UTL A/PC1 B or

UTL B/PC2 B failure, or a split flap configuration will result. Fly a
straight-in or wide pattern with normal AOA and airspeed on final, but
allow for a higher pitch attitude and slower deceleration. If the CAS is off
the line, a more pronounced rolling tendency will be felt but the aircraft
can still be flown.

D - 37 ACG-6


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_44.jpeg:
Landing Gear Unsafe (refer to checklist)

Check the landing gear circuit breaker in the FCP and ensure you have
not inadvertently turned the warning/caution lights rheostat to dim the
gear indicator lights. Visually confirm gear status with a chase aircraft or
ground observer.

If one or both main gear indicates unsafe, but are visually confirmed down
and the forward main landing gear door is closed, make a normal landing.
Main gear doors only close if the gear is locked down.

If a forward main landing gear door is open, select PULSER and make an
approach-end arrestment cable engagement.

If nose gear indicates unsafe, but is visually confirmed down, leave gear
handle down and make a normal landing.

You cannot use the landing light as an indication of gear down, as it comes
on when the gear handle is down, not gear down and locked.

Due to the uncertainty of the status of the antiskid system, place the
antiskid switch to PULSER.

If you are unable to visually confirm gear status or if the gear appears
unsafe, refer to the Landing Gear Emergency Extension checklist.

Landing Gear Emergency Extension (refer to checklist)

Slow to below 250 KCAS and place the landing gear handle down. Then
pull the emergency gear handle in either cockpit, which bypasses the
normal electrical and hydraulic circuits. The JFS provides accumulator
pressure to emergency hydraulic fluid to open the gear doors and unlock
the gear. This allows the gear to gravity fall to the down position. You
may have to yaw and/or porpoise the aircraft to assist in obtaining a
locked indication. After a locked indication is obtained, reset the
emergency landing gear handle. You should use this procedure even if the
gear is partially extended to release any hydraulic block in the system.

If this procedure fails, attempt to pull the gear circuit breaker to remove
electrical power. If this fails, cycling the gear, if able, may alleviate a

mechanical problem.

If any gear still fails to extend, refer to Landing Gear Emergency Landing
checklist.

ACG-6 D - 38


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_45.jpeg:
Landing Gear Emergency Landing (refer to checklist)

If you have completed all of the above procedures and cannot get the gear
down, consult the checklist chart to determine the correct procedure for
landing with your particular gear configuration. Save enough fuel for at
least two approaches and do not forget to review the considerations at the
top of the chart.

Blown Tire (refer to checklist)

When landing with a known blown main tire, select PULSER on the
antiskid switch. Remember that this disengages ARI with the gear down.
Consider an approach-end arrestment.

Stop straight ahead and wait for the fire department before shutting
down, due to fuel venting overboard and the possibility of it going onto hot
brakes during shutdown.

If a blown main tire happens during landing rollout, place the hook down
as required, select PULSER and use braking on the good tire as required.
Select OFF when less than 30 knots.

For a blown nose tire, hold off the ground as long as possible and remove,
lower or land past the cable.

Approach-End Arrestment (refer to checklist)

Reduce landing weight, but have a game plan for a missed engagement!
Save enough fuel for at least two approaches.

Put the hook down and lock the harness inertia reel.

Touch down at least 800 feet from the cable to allow enough time to lower
the nosewheel to the runway before engagement.

Place throttles to idle, lower the nose immediately after touchdown and
neutralize the stick. Never engage the cable with the nosewheel in the
air, otherwise it can impact violently, causing it to collapse and/or causing
other airframe damage.

Engage the cable in the middle (slightly off center if runway centerline

lights are installed) with feet off the brakes. If you apply the brakes when
crossing the cable, resulting friction may drag the cable and cause it to fall
slack on the runway. If this happens, expect an unsuccessful engagement.

D - 39 ACG-6


Text from ACG-6_Hydraulic_Systems_page_46.jpeg:
After the aircraft comes to a stop, tension on the cable pulls the aircraft
backwards. Be prepared to control this rollback with power. Do not use
the brakes to stop backward travel as this tips the aircraft
backward onto the tail and may result in a broken hook or
damage to the empennage.

At approach speed, the tail hook is 3 feet below the main gear and
contacts the ground 70-200 feet prior to main gear touchdown. This may
be a factor if landing over raised cables in the overrun.

Departure-End Arrestment (refer to checklist)

Get the hook down early, at least 2000 feet before the departure-end
cable. You are not going to file it off, and you can always raise it again if
you do not need it. Suffice it to say if it looks dicey, you already need to
have the hook down.

Slow down as much as possible, but plan to engage the cable with feet off
the brakes and use the same techniques as listed above.

AFT 11-2F-15EV38, Chapter 7 requires that the hook be lowered for an
abort if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the runway. The
4th FW Infligth Guide (page H-1) also lists a requirement to lower the
hook when aborting above 100 KCAS. Any abort above 120 KCAS
requires a check for hot brakes.

Hot Brakes (refer to checklist)

If brake overheat is suspected, notify the tower, taxi to the hot brake area
(refer to Inflight Guide, Sections A and E) and head into the wind. Do not
use the holding brake. Release brakes as soon as chocked. Shut down
IAW fire department crew instructions. The fire department may instruct
you to shut down prior to chocking the aircraft. Be prepared to hold the
emergency brakes until the nosewheel is chocked.

Pitch Trim Compensator

Manual trim is controlled by the trim button on the stick, which changes
the neutral position of the longitudinal feel spring. This determines the
neutral (zero force) position of the stick. Automatic pitch trim is done
through a combination of the pitch trim compensator (PTC) and the
control augmentation system (CAS). It is a series input downstream of
the stick that compensates for changes in airspeed or configuration,
without manual trim inputs. It changes the stab position without moving
the stick. A rough estimate of the required auto trim input is made by the
pitch trim compensator. However, the primary calculation is supplied by
the CAS through an interconnect. The automatic pitch trim also drives to
a midrange position and locks if UTL A/PC2 A hydraulic pressure is lost
or the pitch ratio switch is placed to EMERG.

Roll Ratio Changer

The roll ratio changer works much the same as the pitch ratio changer to
give a relatively constant roll response for a given lateral stick input. For
example, at high speed the ratio is lower than at low speed. However, its
job is more complex since pitch (AOA) is also a factor in figuring roll
sensitivity. The roll ratio changer looks at longitudinal stick position
(approximate predictor of AOA) before computing the ratio between stick
movement and aileron/differential stab deflection in order to prevent
adverse yaw.

Also, at aft stick positions the ratio to the ailerons/stabs is lower. Unlike
the pitch ratio changer, there is no gauge that displays the roll ratio.

When roll inputs are being “washed out” due to aft stick, a corresponding
input is made to the ARI to blend in some rudder. The roll ratio will also
go to midrange and lock if hydraulic pressure is lost or the roll ratio switch
is placed to EMERG. A spin recovery aid provides full lateral control
authority, regardless of longitudinal stick position, when the yaw rate
exceeds 41.5°/sec and remains greater than 30°/sec for 5 seconds. If the
yaw rate exceeds 57°/sec, the spin recovery aid is available immediately.
Normal control authority resumes when the yaw rate drops below 30°/sec.
Full aileron/differential stab authority is also available with the landing
gear down.

ACG-7 D-4


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_11.jpeg:
Hydromechanical Aileron-Rudder Interconnect (HM ARI)

The HM ARI is mechanically linked to the stick, the rudder pedals and the
PRCA. It estimates and applies coordinated rudder based on lateral and
longitudinal stick input. As the stick is moved aft of center, the HM ARI
applies more and more rudder for a given lateral stick position (up to 15°
of rudder per inch of lateral stick movement). As the stick is moved
forward of center, the HM ARI applies rudder in the opposite direction (up
to 7.5° of rudder per inch of lateral stick movement). HM ARI inputs are
always summed with rudder pedal inputs. The ARI does not work if the
PRCA is inop; so, if UTL A/PC2 A is lost or if pitch or roll ratios are in
EMERG, the ARI is inop. Above Mach 1.0, HR ARI rudder input is not
desired, so the HM ARI is automatically disengaged. ARI is also
disengaged when the wheels are spinning at 50 knots or faster during
takeoff or landing so that the ARI does not interfere with pilot flight
control movements. However, if the anti-skid switch is placed to PULSER
or OFF, the ARI is cut out as soon as the gear handle is placed down.

Rudder Pedal Travel Limiter

To prevent the rudder pedals from moving the rudders too far in high
speed flight, a rudder pedal travel limiter is provided in each cockpit. It
physically limits pedal travel to 1/3 of normal (which displaces the rudder
about 5°) when above Mach 1.5 and retracts when the speed drops below
it.

ACG-7 D-8


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_15.jpeg:
The CAS is a three axis, three channel fly-by-wire flight control system
that overlays and tracks the HM system (Figure D-5). It normally works
with the HM system but is capable of adequate control on its own. It
takes aircrew commands, measured by the stick force sensors and rudder
pedal position transducers, and compares them to the aircraft response

The flight control computer (FCC) then refines the commands by adding

D-9 ACG-7


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_16.jpeg:
The CAS provides a redundant capability for stability augmentation,
damping and HM refinement in the pitch, roll and yaw axes. There are
three channels in each axis. The inputs, computations and outputs made
are triplex (i.e., there are three separate accelerometers per axis, triplex
voting logic in the flight control computer, etc). If one channel in any axis
disagrees with the other two, failure monitoring automatically removes
the failed channel’s computation from that axis; however, the CAS
continues operating on the two good channels (fail-operate). A subsequent
“like” failure in one of the two remaining channels causes that CAS axis to
disengage, leaving only the HM system to operate the controls (fail-safe).

In addition to providing stability augmentation and refined handling, the
CAS ARI (through the yaw axis) performs a function similar to that of the
hydromechanical ARI. Whereas the HM ARI feeds in rudder as a function
of stick position, the CAS ARI feeds in rudder as a function of roll rate and
AOA and is, more accurately, a roll-rudder interconnect system. CAS ARI
disengages at greater than or equal to Mach 1.5, wheel spin-up to greater
than or equal to 50 knots and negative AOA.

During a spin, the CAS drops off line (greater than 41.5° yaw rate) and
cannot be reset while the spin condition exists in order to prevent pro-spin
control inputs. However, a Direct Electric Link (DEL) is activated to
provide a direct electrical interconnect from the lateral stick to the
stabilator actuators, which enables the pilot to command maximum
differential stabilators for spin recovery.

ACG-7 D-10


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_17.jpeg:
Pitch CAS

The pitch CAS functions as shown in Figure D-6. It can command 10° of
stab travel from the HM input, which gives it quite a bit of authority. It
tracks the HM pitch system through the CAS interconnect (CAST)
servoloop. At higher AOA, pitch CAS inputs are proportionally reduced to
give a more normal feel (i.e., more aft stick force required for higher pitch
attitude/rate). Pitch CAS will disengage if two of the triplex channels fail
or if the CAS-HM interconnect fails. Also, pitch CAS will disengage if it
detects a yaw rate of 41.5°/sec to preclude the possibility of making
pro-spin inputs.

Roll CAS

The roll CAS works basically the same as pitch CAS (Figure D-7). It
provides 5° differential authority over stab movement; it makes no input
to the ailerons. Roll CAS is cut out above 30 units of AOA for spin
prevention and has full authority on the ground at wheel spin-up

(50 knots) to aid in crosswind landing control. It disengages if two
channels fail and if either pitch or yaw CAS fails. It can be reset for a
pitch-only failure but remains disengaged if yaw CAS fails.

Yaw CAS

As you might expect, the yaw CAS functions are basically the same as
pitch and roll CAS (Figure D-8). Its authority is 15°. CAS ARI is provided
by yaw CAS. Yaw CAS has 3.75° of authority to keep the ball centered;
therefore, manual rudder trim is normally not used. Fail logic/
disengagement is the same as that for pitch and roll; it also cuts out above
41.5°/sec yaw rate.

Autopilot

The autopilot can automatically maintain attitude/altitude and desired
steering. For any autopilot mode or submode to operate, all CAS axes
must be engaged and working properly. Also, the INS and the air data
computer must be available for reference. Autopilot operation details are
covered in another lesson.

CONTROLS AND INDICATORS

There is a standard pitch/roll trim button on each stick grip. The force
transducer, which sits at the base of the stick grip, senses and transmits
aircrew inputs to the CAS. The paddle switch does the following when
pressed:

Terminates AFCS BIT (ground)

Interrupts nose gear steering (ground) (press and hold)
Disengages autopilot (air)

Resets terrain following (TF) flyups (air)

Interrupts auto and armed TF operations (air)

Resets CAS (called rapid CAS reset) (air with yaw rate less than 10°
per second)

Rudder Pedals

Each cockpit has a set of rudder pedals that perform rudder movement,
wheel brake and nose gear steering functions.

pedals, which move toward you by heavy spring pressure. You must
physically push them away for adjustment.

NOTE
Have your feet on the pedals before pulling the adjust knob.

The CAS control panel is located on the left console just forward of the
throttles in the front cockpit (Figure D-11). On it are the yaw, roll and
pitch CAS switches, TF couple switch, takeoff trim button and light, and
the BIT button.

CAS Switches

These switches control the three CAS axes and they function as follows:
ON Allows normal operation after engagement.

RESET Engages a disconnected axis providing no fault exists; the
switch is spring loaded from RESET to ON.

OFF Disengages the applicable axis; lever locked position.

D-17 ACG-7


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_24.jpeg:
The CAS channels should be engaged from left to right (yaw-roll-pitch).

To reengage any one of the CAS channels, you momentarily go to the reset
position which engages it, provided there is no malfunction in that
channel. If you lose pitch CAS, the roll CAS will also disengage. You can
reset the roll channel if nothing is wrong with it, even if the pitch channel
will not reset. However, if you lose yaw CAS, roll will not reset until yaw
CAS does.

TF Couple Switch

This two-position switch couples the automatic terrain following mode.

Takeoff Trim Button and Light

When the takeoff trim button is pressed, it drives the stick and rudder
pedal feel springs to the takeoff position. This, in turn, moves the cockpit
controls to their takeoff location and positions the rudders and ailerons to
neutral and the stabs in a symmetrical, slightly nose up attitude. This
provides maximum pitch authority for rotation at takeoff. The “YAW
RATE, YAW RATE” voice warning and yaw rate departure warning tone
sounds (900 Hz beeping tone corresponding to a yaw rate of approximately
30°/sec) and the take off trim light comes on when the button is depressed
and the flight control surfaces and flight controls are in the proper
position. The tone and light go off when the button is released.

BIT Push Button

The BIT button on the CAS panel is used in concert with the paddle
switch on the stick to clear AFCS BIT codes. To clear AFCS BIT codes,
press and hold the paddle switch, and then press and release the BIT
button. The AFCS BIT codes are cleared prior to flight control group
checks.

The BIT button is also used in concert with the MPD/MPCD BIT display

to initiate an AFCS BIT. AFCS BIT initiation is described later in this
workbook.

Pitch Ratio Switch and Indicator

The pitch ratio switch and gauge are located next to the landing gear
handle in the front cockpit (Figure D-12). With the switch in AUTO, the
computing functions of the CSBPC work normally. If the switch is placed
to EMERG, the pitch ratio changer drives to the midrange of .3 to .5 and
locks; also, automatic pitch trim locks in midrange and the HM ARI is
disabled.

The gauge shows the position of the pitch ratio changer. The scale reads
from zero, the minimum ratio, to a maximum value/ratio of 1.0. Below
about 250 KCAS, the pitch ratio should be 1.0.

Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_27.jpeg:
Rudder Trim Switch

Located in the right rear corner of both throttle quadrants, this switch
changes the neutral position of the rudder feel spring and the rudder
pedals. Normally, the yaw CAS makes use of this switch unnecessary.
Warning Tones

There are three warning tones that sound to indicate potentially
hazardous flight regimes: gear down AOA tone, departure warning tone

and high AOA warning tone.

Landing Gear AOA Tone

This 1600 Hz AOA warning tone beeps in flight when the angle-of-attack
reaches approximately 30 units with the gear down. The beep rate
increases with increasing AOA and does not stop until the AOA is reduced
below 30 units.

High AOA Tone

A programmable high AOA warning tone incorporates a 900 Hz tone
doublet (two short 10 Hz beeps followed by a 0.3 second pause) to cue the
aircrew when the programmed AOA is exceeded. The AOA setting is
changed at PB #15 on the HUD repeater display. The system defaults to
30 units AOA at aircraft power up with CFTs, external A/G stores and
miscellaneous stores; but can be programmed for 20 to 45 units AOA. For
all other loadings the system defaults to off (to include A/A only). If the
value is set at 46-50 units AOA, the tone is also off. Programming can be
done on the ground or airborne. The warning tone is heard and the HUD
AOA flashes when the programmed limit is equaled or exceeded.

D-21 ACG-7


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_28.jpeg:
Departure Warning Tone

The departure warning tone provides warning of an impending departure
and warns the aircrew of improper control inputs and excessive yaw rates.
The required pilot action for excessive yaw rate is to smoothly neutralize
the controls.

Departure warning tone activation generates the “YAW RATE, YAW
RATE” voice warning followed by a 900 Hz beeping tone when the yaw
rate (under certain conditions) exceeds 15°/sec. As the yaw rate increases,
the beep rate increases, reaching a maximum at 60°/sec yaw rate. This
tone is the same as the one heard when setting the T/O Trim (beep rate
for approximately 30°/sec yaw rate).

The departure warning, the overload warning system and the high AOA
warning all use the same 900 Hz tone. However, each tone uses a
different repeat rate and the departure warning tone has priority over the
other tones.

Spin Recovery Display (SRD)

The purpose of the SRD is to provide information to help the aircrew
recover from an up-right or inverted spin and verify the out-of-control
condition is a spin and not an auto-roll. When the flight control computer
detects a spin condition, the CC displays an SRD on all MPD/MPCDs
(Figure D-14), LAWS is reset to activate at 10,000’ AGL and again at
5000’ AGL, and the VTRS split screen records the HUD and FCP left MPD
until 30 seconds after recovery. “SPIN RECOVERY?” is displayed and an
arrow indicates the required stick position (full left/full right), and throttle
position bars indicate recommended throttle placement (idle/mil) for an
upright spin. “CONTROLS NEUTRAL?” is displayed for an inverted spin.

stick arrow is removed. Four seconds after “RECOVER” is shown on the
SRD, all displays return to their pre-spin assigned format.

The SRD is not a selectable format and cannot be tested on the ground.

MALFUNCTION INDICATIONS

Flight control malfunction indications are presented in the cockpit in two
different ways. Some are displayed on the FCP right MPD and RCP right
MPCD and cause the FLT CONTR major category caution light and
MASTER CAUTION light to illuminate. Others are displayed on the
BIT/DETAIL/AFCS/STATUS page. These trigger the AV BIT, FLT
CONTR and MASTER CAUTION lights.

Flight Control Caution Light

The amber flight control caution light, labeled FLT CONTR, is one of the
major category lights on the caution lights panel (Figure D-15). The
purpose of the flight control caution light is to prompt you to check the
MPD/MPCD for a specific caution from that category, or if it illuminates
in conjunction with the AV BIT light, to check the BIT/DETAIL/AFCS/
STATUS page for other flight control anomalies.

state, some BITs were not accomplished.
Aircrew should perform another AFCS BIT to

MALFUNCTION ACTIONS
General

If you detect or suspect a flight control malfunction while airborne, there
are a few general rules to follow. First, terminate your maneuvering,
climb to a safe altitude and slow down. Check the cockpit for warnings,
cautions and advisory messages on the BIT/Detail page. If the CAS is off,
attempt to reset. If the CAS is on, do not turn it off. It may be the only
reason you are still in control. Refer to the checklist procedure and/or the
AFCS functional status summary pages to determine actions. In most
situations, a controllability check is a good idea to preclude surprises in
the landing pattern. Know the system; know and use the checklist.

Pitch Ratio Failure

A pitch ratio malfunction may be detected by the appropriate caution
indications or by abnormal pitch response (too much or too little
oscillation). You can check the pitch ratio indicator for readings that are
obviously incorrect or fluctuating.

As with any malfunction or emergency, refer to the checklist. EMERG
should only be tried if pitch CAS is still on line or the airspeed is below
300 KCAS. Once below 300 knots, look at the pitch ratio indicator. If it
reads below .3 or if oscillations are making control difficult, you can
improve handling by selecting EMERG on the pitch ratio switch. This will
also deactivate the HM ARI and lock the automatic pitch trim at
midrange. As long as CAS is on line, control should be adequate for flight.
Consider a controllability check prior to landing from a straight-in
approach. If the pitch ratio fails during takeoff with the pitch CAS off,
abort the takeoff if conditions permit.

ACG-7 D - 32


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_39.jpeg:
Roll Ratio Failure

A roll ratio problem may be detected by the appropriate caution
indications or by abnormal roll response. Evaluate handling qualities at
approach speed with roll ratio in both AUTO and EMERG. EMERG cuts
out the HM ARI but gives a moderate roll response. It may reduce the
ability to level a heavy wing. With roll CAS off and roll ratio in EMERG,
do not exceed 18 units AOA with large lateral asymmetry.

Pitch CAS Failure with AFT CG

If pitch CAS failure occurs with CG near the aft limit, handling qualities
will be significantly degraded at low altitudes. Short, quick stick inputs
will be required to preclude a PIO. You will have to slow the aircraft
without using the speed brake (the speed brake may cause an
uncontrollable pitch down). Evaluate handling qualities at slow speed.
You may have to jettison external stores in order to maintain adequate
aircraft control.

Lateral Stick Limit Caution

Reduce AOA below 30 units, limit lateral stick inputs to one-half, and
check the BIT/DETAIL/AFCS/STATUS display. Several combination
failures with LAT STK LMT caution are possible. Refer to the AFCS
functional status summary.

NOTE

LAT STK LIMIT and YAW CAS cautions may be displayed after a

single engine shutdown. This is normal—attempt a YAW CAS reset.

Trim

If the trim runs away in any direction, the aircraft is still completely
controllable. Unless other flight control malfunctions are evident, leave
the pitch and roll ratios in AUTO. Slow below 250 knots and if the
condition cannot be controlled with normal trim controls, push the take off
trim button. Pulling the AFCS ESS AC circuit breaker (upper-pitch trim,
lower yaw and roll trim) removes power from the trim actuators. So,
while holding the trim neutral, pull the appropriate circuit breakers.

Hydraulic Failure (UTL A/PC2 A)

Loss of both the UTL A and PC2 A circuits has the same effect as placing
the pitch and roll ratio switches to EMERG. The ratios lock at midrange,
automatic pitch trim is lost and the HM ARI is inop.

Rudder System Malfunctions (Deflected Rudder Malfunctions)

If a rudder control cable is broken or jammed, flight control inputs, which
cause rudder movement, will probably result in irreversible deflection of
one or both rudders. Failure of a rudder actuator may cause that rudder
to go hardover in one direction. These conditions can be confirmed
visually; the aircraft should be controllable as long as the CAS is engaged.
Do not turn the CAS off. Avoid unnecessary G loading since aircraft
control will be reduced as AOA increases. Consider using asymmetrical
thrust.

Rudder Limit Caution

Above Mach 1.5, limit rudder inputs to 1/3 to avoid excessive slide slip
conditions. Below Mach 1.5, rudder pedal travel should be checked to
verify if the travel is limited or unlimited. If limited, directional control
during landing may be degraded because both rudder and nosewheel
steering inputs will be limited. Pulling the right air inlet control circuit
breaker in the rear cockpit may restore rudder pedal travel for landing
(cuts power to the rudder limiter). However, the right inlet will move to
the full up and locked position. If normal rudder travel cannot be
regained, consider an approach end arrestment.

CAS Failure

Without the CAS, control is still provided by the HM system in a given
axis; however, no stability augmentation or refined handling modifications
are provided. As long as the HM system is operating normally, loss of the
CAS causes only slight degradation of aircraft control. It will probably
feel sensitive at high speed and sloppy at slow speed. If the CAS fails,
attempt to reset. If the CAS keeps failing, leave it off to preclude a
surprise disengagement during landing or other critical phase of flight. If
yaw CAS fails and will not reset, maintain AOA below 30 units.

ACG-7 D - 34


Text from ACG-7_Flight_Controls_page_41.jpeg:
Combined Failures

Combined failures of both the CAS and HM systems can result in severely
degraded aircraft control. For example, with loss of UTL A/PC2 A and
simultaneous loss of the CAS, pitch and roll ratios drive to EMERG,
automatic pitch trim and ARI are inop, and there is no CAS to “take up
the slack.” With CFTs installed, a 3 G nose up transient may occur. You
will have to concentrate hard on just flying the aircraft. With pitch CAS
inoperative and pitch ratio in EMERG, the maximum attainable AOA at
touchdown speed is only 21 units, so the procedure is to fly a flat 18 unit
approach. There is a good discussion of combination failures in Section VI
of the Dash-1.

Controllability Check

A controllability check is a good idea for an indicated or suspected flight
control problem. Refer to the checklist/flight manual.

Anti-Skid Caution

Although not part of the flight control system, the anti-skid will affect the
operation of the hydromechanical ARI as already mentioned. Realize that
if the anti-skid fails and the switch is left in NORM, the ARI may not
disengage upon landing.

SURVIVABILITY

While there are some flight control malfunctions that significantly affect
handling quality, the system is highly redundant and very survivable in a
combat environment.

Electrical Loss

If all electrical power is lost, control is maintained through the mechanical
system to operate ailerons, stabs and rudders (Figure D-20). Basic control
is still there, but degraded with pitch and roll ratios in emergency and
CAS’s off line.

Mechanical Loss

If any or all mechanical controls are jammed, limited control can still be
maintained by the CAS. The stabilators will function for pitch and roll
and both rudders are still available (Figure D-20). The only things you do
not have are ailerons.

Loss of Both PC Hydraulic Systems

If both primary flight control hydraulic systems (PC1 and PC2) are lost,
the utility hydraulic system supplies power to all primary flight controls
(Figure D-20).

Mixed Hydraulic Losses

When either PC hydraulic system plus the utility hydraulic system are
lost (not a common occurrence), control is maintained with one aileron,
one rudder, and stabilators for pitch and roll (Figure D-20). Also, note
that one flap is failed on the “dead wing” in this case.

FLIGHT CONTROL GROUND CHECKS

The aircrew must advise the ground crew prior to conducting flight control
checks. The hydromechanical system is checked first to ensure proper
deflection of the control surfaces, including the pitch trim compensator.
The surfaces should deflect in the same manner as in the CAS ON check
(Table D-3) with the major exception being only 15° (HM) of rudder
deflection versus 30° (HM+CAS). Notice that the stabilators will deflect
differentially when the stick is put left or right of neutral.

Verify no BIT codes or failures on the BIT/DETAIL/AFCS/STATUS and

AFCS BIT

To start the AFCS BIT, press and hold the BIT button on the CAS panel,
and then press and release the AFCS BIT push button on the MPD/MPCD
BIT display. “AFCS IN TEST” will appear on the MPD/MPCD BIT
display when the AFCS BIT begins. Release the BIT button on the CAS
panel once the AFCS BIT is initiated. The AFCS BIT runs automatically
after initiation. The AFCS BIT will not run unless the holding brake is
ON and the aircraft senses weight on the wheels. The AFCS BIT option is
not available while airborne. The complete BIT takes approximately

1 minute and 40 seconds.
WARNING

AFCS BIT will cycle the controls and
the control surfaces. Flight and
ground crew must stay clear of the
flight control system while AFCS BIT
is IN TEST.

Upon completion of the AFCS BIT, reset CAS and check BIT/DETAIL/
AFCS/STATUS and FAULTS pages for any BIT malfunctions. Checking
the FAULTS and STATUS pages should always be done since “AFCS*”
may not always be displayed on the BIT pages to alert the aircrew of
AFCS BIT problems.

NOTE

The preflight flight control checks are covered in detail in the lecture.

FLIGHT CONTROL SURFACES

The F-15E flight control system is designed to provide excellent handling
characteristics and flight path control throughout the aircraft’s extensive
flight envelope. It incorporates both a hydromechanical system (HM) and
an automatic flight control system (AFCS). These two systems were made
to work together in harmony to give manual and automatic control of the
airplane. The two also provide redundancy in that the aircraft can be
safely flown using the AFCS alone following HM jams. Likewise, the
airplane can easily be flown with just the hydromechanical system
operating.

The primary flight control surfaces consist of conventional ailerons, twin
rudders and stabilators, which move collectively for pitch and
differentially for roll (Figure D-1). Stabilators and rudders are operated
by both the hydromechanical and automatic systems; however, the
ailerons work only through the HM system. Spring cartridges are
incorporated, providing artificial “feel” to the aircrew.

Control Stick Boost Pitch Compensator (CSBPC)

Hydraulic power from the Utility A circuit, backed up by PC2 A, provides
the force to adjust the ratios, trim inputs and interconnects between the
different controls. This “power steering” is collectively called the control
stick boost/pitch compensator (CSBPC). There is no single box labeled
“CSBPC”; rather, it is a combination of two separate assemblies: the pitch
and roll channel assembly (PRCA) and the aileron-rudder interconnect
(ARD.

Pitch and Roll Channel Assembly

The PRCA is made up of a pitch ratio changer, a pitch trim compensator
and a roll ratio changer. They provide the same pitch/roll response for a
given stick deflection, regardless of airspeed, plus an automatic pitch trim
feature.

Pitch Ratio Changer

The pitch ratio changer uses pitot-static inputs of altitude and airspeed to
determine an appropriate ratio between longitudinal stick movement and
stabilator displacement. The intent is to produce a consistent pitch
response (constant G for a given stick position) throughout the flight
envelope (two Gs per inch of stick movement). Each G requires
approximately 4.25 pounds of stick-force.

The pitch ratio is displayed to the pilot as a decimal fraction between one
and zero. For example, at low speeds (<250 KCAS) the ratio should read
near 1.0, indicating maximum stabilator authority. As speed increases
the ratio decreases. At about Mach 0.9 at low altitude, where the aircraft
is much more pitch sensitive, the ratio should read near zero. As speed is
increased above Mach 1.0, the ratio starts to climb providing more
stabilator authority. When hydraulic power is lost (UTL A/PC2 A
failures), the pitch ratio reverts to a fixed midrange value and locks. This
is displayed on the pitch ratio indicator by the needle indicating 0.3 to 0.5.
This setting is also selected by placing the pitch ratio switch to EMERG.

Text from ACG-8_Caution__Warning_System_Integration_page_10.jpeg:
“MESSAGE” and “THREAT WARNING’ are joint tactical information
distribution system (JTIDS) voice messages. They are only heard during
COMM BIT until JTIDS is installed in the aircraft.

Voice warning volume cannot be adjusted.

Once the voice warning is stated it is not given again unless the condition
causing the voice warning system to activate is corrected and the
condition recurs.

Voice warnings for “OBSTACLE AHEAD” or “TF FAIL” are repeated until
the condition causing them is corrected.

Certain failures of the overload warning system (OWS) would result in a
continuous “OVER-G” warning. If “OVER-G” comes on for 30 seconds and
then stops, it may not be because the system has corrected itself. Logic is
incorporated to shut down the overload warning system after 30 seconds
of accumulated voice warning. Check the HUD current G and maximum
allowable G to verify proper OWS operation.

The “PULL-UP, PULL-UP” voice warning associated with the ground

collision warning system (GCWS) is given a maximum of four times and
has precedence over all other voice warnings.

AOA Warning Tone (with Landing Gear Down)

The AOA warning tone only sounds when the landing gear is down. At
approximately 30 units AOA a beeping tone sounds. The beep rate
increases as the AOA increases. You should eliminate the tone by
reducing the AOA.

OWS Warning Tone

An overload warning tone beeps (single rate) at 85% maximum allowable
G or 1 G below the maximum allowable, whichever is lower. G readout on
the HUD flashes in conjunction with the tone onset to warn that
maximum allowable G is being approached. The beep rate increases as
the percentage of maximum allowable G increases. At 92%, the tone rate
doubles. At 100% the tone becomes steady. The voice warning (“OVER-G,
OVER-G”) replaces the OWS tone above 100%. The warning continues
until the overload condition is corrected, or stops after 30 seconds.

High AOA Warning Tone (with Landing Gear Up)

The programmable high AOA warning tone cues the aircrew when the
programmed AOA is exceeded. The system defaults to 30 units AOA at
aircraft power up with CFTs and A/G stores loaded, but can be
programmed for 20-45 units AOA (entering a value between 46-50 units
turns the tone OFF). The warning tone is heard and the AOA on the
HUD flashes when the limit is reached or exceeded. The warning tone is
characterized by a series of audio “doublets” and remains on until AOA is
reduced to below the programmed AOA.

Departure Warning Tone

The departure (yaw rate) tone sounds only with the gear up. A beeping
tone sounds when actual or predicted yaw rate reaches 15°/second. As the
yaw rate increases, the beep rate increases and reaches its maximum at
60°/second yaw rate. In addition, a voice warning “YAW RATE, YAW
RATE? is also heard.

ACG-8 D-10


Text from ACG-8_Caution__Warning_System_Integration_page_17.jpeg:
The “YAW RATE” warning tone may be checked by pressing the takeoff
trim button. When the takeoff trim light is on and the takeoff trim button
is depressed, the “YAW RATE” voice warning sounds and the yaw rate
warning tone beeps until the takeoff trim button is released.

The 900 Hz tone is obviously used for three distinct conditions. In certain
flight conditions, parameters may exist to initiate one or more of these
tones. The CC priority is: (1) departure warning (yaw rate), (2) overload
warning (OVER-G), and (3) high AOA. In addition, a high AOA tone may
be heard in conjunction with “OVER-G” voice warning. A departure tone
will inhibit the high AOA for three seconds, and always has priority.

The relation of the three 900 Hz tones is presented graphically in
Figure D-4.

The LANTIRN system produces a “BINK-BINK’” tone to advise the
aircrew that automatic terrain following (ATF) has been selected but is
not controlling the aircraft (no ATF condition) or that the terrain following
system is unarmed (no AUTO FLYUP protection provided).

In some cases, the bell tone may not be heard simultaneously with
illumination of the UNARMED/NO ATF light, since the TF related voice
warnings have priority over the bell tone. The bell tone sounds after the
other voice warnings with a higher priority have sounded.

CAUTION INDICATIONS

Cautions provide indications of system malfunctions which require less
than immediate attention.

There are two ways that cautions are usually displayed:

e Amber lights on the CAUTION LIGHTS panels in the front and rear
cockpits.

e Onthe MPD/MPCDs in both cockpits.
Though there are technically no voice messages defined as cautions (they

are all voice warnings), some voice warnings may be received with display
cautions; e.g., BINGO FUEL and XFER PUMP.

Caution Lights

MASTER CAUTION Light

MASTER CAUTION lights on both cockpit instrument panels

(Figures D-6 and D-7) are used to direct your attention to displayed
cautions. The MASTER CAUTIONS light up at the same time as the
following: EMER BST ON, BST SYS MAL, NUCLEAR, FUEL LOW, L/R
GEN, ENGINE, FLT CONTR, HYD, DSPL FLO LO, OXYGEN, or when
any MPD/MPCD (display) caution comes on.

The MASTER CAUTION lights do not light up with the red warning
lights. However, conditions/malfunctions that generate cautions as a
result of the warning condition will illuminate the MASTER CAUTION.

Pressing the FCP MASTER CAUTION light turns off both master
cautions and resets the master caution circuit. The caution lights and
MPD/MPCD display cautions do not go out until the condition/malfunction
is corrected.

An exception to the display caution logic is the autopilot caution system.
The FLT CONTR light and AUTO PLT display caution are extinguished
by pressing the MASTER CAUTION light. Subsequent autopilot related
problems alert the aircrew using the same system and display cautions.

The RCP MSTR CAUT light does not turn off the master caution lights or
reset the master caution light circuit.

Master cautions do not light with the AV BIT caution. Still, pressing
either master caution does turn off the AV BIT caution light.

MPD/MPCD Caution Displays

Normal Operation

The MPD/MPCD cautions are initially displayed on the FCP right MPD
and the RCP right MPCD (Figure D-10). (Cautions go to the designated
MPD/MPCD, even if it is off or inoperative.) The cautions are displayed in
three columns and written from left to right. The most recent caution is
displayed furthest right on the highest row. When displayed, they
normally occlude the information behind them. MPD/MPCD display
cautions are removed when conditions are corrected, or the cautions are
decluttered from the MPD/MPCD.

Caution Declutter

As long as at least one display caution is available for viewing, the crew
may declutter all cautions from the display. This is done in the FCP by
holding the MASTER CAUTION depressed while pressing down (in) on
the castle switch on the FCP stick. In the RCP, holding the MSTR CAUT

light depressed while thumbing aft on either coolie switch will provide the
same function.

All currently displayed cautions are removed and a boxed CAUT is
displayed in the lower left corner of the MPD/MPCD of each cockpit

(Figure D-11). The boxed CAUT only occludes the area behind it and not
the whole line.

Cautions decluttered mode is exited and all current cautions are
redisplayed when:

e Anew caution occurs.
e Acaution self-corrects then fails again.

IFF MODE 4 Display Caution

The IFF MODE 4 display caution can be caused by failure to respond to a
valid interrogation, zeroized code, or internal component failure. The IFF
MODE 4 caution is removed from the MPD/MPCD by pressing PB #16
(M/4 CAUT DSBL) on the BIT 2 display (Figure D-12). This removes the
caution if it is displayed on the cautions display or if the cautions are
decluttered from the caution display.

If the MODE 4 caution disable is deselected with display cautions
decluttered (CAUT boxed), a MODE 4 caution causes the cautions
decluttered mode to be exited. The IFF MODE 4 caution is displayed
along with other current cautions.

Moving Cautions

If desired, the right MPD/MPCD caution display may be moved to another
display. Cautions then appear on the newly designated MPD/MPCD. If
the causes for the cautions are cleared, any new cautions again appear on
the last display selected for display of cautions.

It may be necessary to move the MPD/MPCD caution display for purposes
of regaining information that is being occluded, or to monitor cautions
when the designated MPD/MPCD is inoperative or turned off.

In the FCP, cautions are moved by holding the MASTER CAUTION light
depressed while:

e moving the castle switch left to move the cautions to the left MPD.
e moving the castle switch aft to move the cautions to the MPCD.

In the RCP, the MSTR CAUT light and hand controllers are used to move
the cautions.

e THE RIGHT HAND CONTROLLER MANAGES THE RIGHT SIDE

INTRODUCTION

The F-15E Warning, Caution, and Advisory system alerts the aircrew to
system degrades, failures, malfunctions, and routine operation by the use
of the following.

Warning Indications - Lights, voice, and tones that warn of a system
malfunction and/or other important information.

Caution Indications - Lights, MPD/MPCD display, and tones indicating
system malfunction and/or information to be noted.

Advisory Lights - Provide signs of safe and normal conditions and
impart information for routine purposes.

WARNING INDICATIONS
Warning Lights

All warning lights are red and provide indications of system malfunctions
that require immediate aircrew attention. They are located at or near the
top of the instrument panel in both cockpits (Figures D-1 and D-2).
Exceptions are the gear handle light (FCP) and the gear unsafe light
(RCP). The AMAD fire and AB burn-through lights are located in the
FCP only. When the condition that caused the warning light to come on is
corrected, the light goes off.

NOTE: Each warning light display, its cause, and corrective action are
covered in the associated system lesson and in the following lesson,
Emergency Procedures/Abnormal Operations (ACG-9).

For quick reference of warning light causes and initial corrective action,
use the Warnings, Cautions, and Advisories matrix found in TO 1F-15E-1,
Section III, and the Emergency Procedures Section of the F-15E aircrew
checklist.

Voice Warnings
Voice warnings are available for the following and are stated as:

“AB BURN-THROUGH LEFT”

“AB BURN-THROUGH RIGHT”
“BINGO FUEL”

“LOW ALTITUDE”

“OBSTACLE AHEAD”

“OVER-G”

“TF FAIL”

“WARNING, AMAD FIRE”
“WARNING, OVERTEMP LEFT”
“WARNING, OVERTEMP RIGHT”
“WARNING, FUEL LOW”
“WARNING, ENGINE FIRE LEFT”
“WARNING, ENGINE FIRE RIGHT”
“WARNING, TRANSFER PUMP”
“YAW RATE”

“MESSAGE”

“THREAT WARNING”

“PULL-UP, PULL-UP”

With the exception of “OVER-G,” “OBSTACLE AHEAD,” “PULL-UP,” and
“TF FAIL” warnings, all voice warnings are stated twice. For example, a
left engine fire causes the voice warning system to state:

e “WARNING - ENGINE FIRE LEFT; WARNING - ENGINE FIRE
LEFT”

or an AMAD fire causes the voice warning to state:

e “WARNING - AMAD FIRE; WARNING - AMAD FIRE”

Abnormal Engine Start

For this discussion, abnormal engine starts (-220 engines) include:
e = engine fails to start,

e = engine fails to accelerate normally,

e hot starts, and

e auto acceleration.

Engine light off normally occurs within about five or six seconds after rpm
reaches 26%-30%. If no light off occurs within 30 seconds (from throttle
movement from off), shut the throttle off. If you wish to try another start,
allow the engine to windmill for 10 seconds to dry out any fuel that was
sent to the engine during the initial starting process. Then bring the
throttle back to idle when you are ready to try again. If you elect not to
try another start then leave the throttle in OFF, position the engine
master switch to OFF, and shut the JFS off.

If, during the engine start sequence (after light off) both rpm and FTIT
stop increasing, abandon the start and shut off the throttle, master
switch, and JFS switch. Complete the shutdown procedure.

If it appears that you are going to get a hot start (i.e., FTIT is going to
exceed 680° C), shut the throttle off. If 680° C was exceeded, allow the
engine to windmill to help cooling (this may require restarting the JFS
and/or reengaging the JFS to the engine). Then turn off the master
switch and the JFS. Once again, you are through for the day with this
aircraft. If, however, 680° C was not exceeded (you recognized the
impending hot start and took appropriate action), you can try another
start. Shut the throttle off and let the JFS windmill the engine until the
FTIT is below 200° C (remember, that is the lowest you can read on the
EMD, so once you see 200° C wait 10 more seconds before you attempt
another start). Change the air source knob over to the engine you are
going to start (to shut off bleed air from the other engine) and bring the
throttle back over to IDLE. Once the engine is running, remember to
switch the air source knob back to the BOTH position. If you do not select
BOTH on the air source knob, ECS air is cut off from one engine. Cool air
to the avionics and cockpit may be affected. ECS/DISP FLO LO lights will
illuminate if the airflow is insufficient to cool the avionics. The crew chief
will notice the loss of air flow from one engine during the ECS check
following second engine start.

ACG-9 D-4


Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_11.jpeg:
If auto acceleration occurs during the start (i.e., the motor keeps
accelerating on its own above idle rpm with the throttle in idle), shut the
engine down immediately—throttle, fire light, master switch, JFS switch.
The engine nozzle may be closed down and the added thrust may cause
the aircraft to jump the chocks. On a crowded ramp, this can get real
exciting!

AMAD or Engine Fire During Start

The immediate concern here is to get the fire put out as quickly as
possible. Although the steps are slightly different (AMAD FIRE =
button/bottle/throttle; ENGINE FIRE = button/throttle/bottle) the intent
is to shut off the source of fuel. When you discharge the fire extinguisher
for the AMAD fire, you automatically shut down the JFS. For an engine
fire, push the fire light button to shut off the source of engine fuel at the
airframe and then shut down the throttle, discharge the extinguisher and
lastly, shut off the master switch and JFS switch. If you have either of
these fires, depending on severity, you may want to emergency ground
egress.

GROUND OPERATIONS
ECS Caution

An ECS problem on start may be indicated by a DISPL FLO LO caution
light. A quick, simple fix may be to just start the second engine and check
for absence of both the DISPL FLO LO caution and the MPD/MPCD ECS
caution. If there is a delay starting the second engine, advancing the right
engine to 73% (definitely below 78%) may solve the problem. Ensure that
AUTO is selected on the temperature control switch and that BOTH is
selected on the air source knob. If the ECS caution remains on for one
minute after both engines are running, we can cycle the air source knob
(L, R, BOTH) while the crew chief checks the air flow at each position. Set
the rpm of the operating side at 77% rpm and cycle the nonoperating side
idle to 78% rpm, while simultaneously cycling the air source knob (L, R,
BOTH). If, after 10 minutes, the ECS caution remains on, abort the
mission. Do not taxi out of the chocks with an ECS problem.

Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_12.jpeg:
If the ECS caution comes on while taxiing, attempt the previously
described procedure. If it does not extinguish, shut down an engine to
induce automatic avionics shutdown. If automatic avionics shutdown does
not occur, manually turn off as much equipment as possible and shut
down the aircraft as soon as practical (including arming/quick check
area—vice taxiing back to parking). If shutting down in quick check area,
ensure wheels are chocked as you will lose braking capability.

Loss of Brakes

It is important to remember that very little deceleration will be sensed at
speeds above 100 knots, regardless of antiskid system status. At high
speed, if loss of brakes is determined, consider the option of a cable
engagement and lower the hook early and avoid the rush. In addition to
lowering the hook, attempt to reduce your speed by releasing the brakes,
turning the antiskid to PULSER, and reapplying the brakes. Ifa cable is
not practical/available, release the brakes, turn the antiskid switch to
PULSER, and reapply the brakes. The pulsating braking action reduces
the probability of blown tires from locked wheels but also prevents
bringing the aircraft to a complete stop. Therefore, once slowed to taxi
speed, turn the antiskid switch to OFF. If the antiskid was not the source
of the problem and braking is not restored, or if stopping distance is
critical, release the brakes and pull the emergency brake/steering handle.
Depress the paddle switch to ensure crossover to JFS accumulator
pressure. Smoothly and steadily reapply the brakes, keeping in mind that
the emergency system bypasses the antiskid/pulser system and increases
the possibility of blown tires. If you are taxiing the aircraft on a congested
ramp and lose braking, the immediate problem is to stop the aircraft. Pull
the emergency brake/steer handle! Remember, whenever you change the
brake system, (antiskid switch or emer brake/steer handle) release pedal
pressure before accomplishing the changeover.

If the aircraft is going to depart the prepared surface, shut down the
engines to limit the damage to the engines.

TAKEOFF
Abort

The abort decision is influenced by many variables which are often
relevant in any takeoff situation. These factors include (but are not
limited to) runway remaining, arresting gear availability, weather,
aircraft weight and speed, and nature of the emergency. They should be
considered before ever stepping to the aircraft. A catastrophic engine
failure at nosewheel rotation in a 70,000 pound aircraft, on a wet runway
with ceiling and visibility at 300 feet and one mile, is not the time to be
agonizing over whether to continue the takeoff or stay on the ground.

Once you decide to abort, chop the throttles to IDLE and apply the brakes.
If stopping distance is critical, begin maximum antiskid braking. Use as
much pedal force as possible (not just enough to get antiskid cycling). If
aborting with a blown main tire, select PULSER. Pulser prevents
continuous loss of brake pressure due to skid sensing on the blown tire
and allows braking on the good tire. If both mains are blown, be ready to
counter any skid with timely nose gear steering inputs in the direction of
the skid. Maneuvering mode (nose gear steering button depressed) may
be needed for adequate control. In either case, do not jeopardize your
ability to maintain directional control. Anticipate a barrier engagement;
lower the hook early and engage as close to center as possible without
brakes applied.

WARNING

Fuel draining overboard after engine
shutdown can contact a hot wheel and
cause a fire. Engine shutdown before
arrival of firefighting equipment should
be avoided where hot brakes exist.

Tire Failure During Takeoff

A blown tire during the takeoff roll is very difficult to recognize from the
cockpit. Your only indication may be a call from the tower or a trailing
wingman. If you get airborne, do not retract the gear or flaps. Keep the
airspeed under 250 knots, if practical, to prevent automatic flap
retraction. The interval between takeoff and landing should be mostly
routine; i.e., burn down fuel to land as soon as practical. Have a chase or
the tower check over the aircraft, just in case. While the runway is being
cleared of any debris, begin burning down/dumping fuel to a reasonable
landing weight. Review the landing with blown tires procedure in the
checklist. With the landing gear handle down, neither the internal nor
external fuel tanks pressurize. In this condition the internal tanks
transfer normally but the external tanks do not transfer until the FUEL
LOW light illuminates. External fuel does not dump normally with the
gear handle down. There is a procedure (in Chapter 3 of the Dash 1 and
the Dash 1 checklist) for transferring/dumping external fuel with the
landing gear down. If the situation is warranted, you could use this
procedure to dump/burn external fuel and achieve desired landing weight
faster. Maneuver conservatively once PULSER is selected since the ARI
is disengaged with PULSER selected and gear down.

External Stores Jettison

External stores may be jettisoned by either the selective or emergency
jettison systems. Selective jettison is provided with the selective jettison
knob in conjunction with the MPD/MPCD display. COMBAT, A/A, and
A/G selective jettison mechanization are covered in detail in later lessons
or you can refer to TO 1F-15E-1, Section I, Stores Jettison System, for
additional information.

Although selective jettison is not available until the gear handle is up,
emergency jettison is possible; i.e., the button is hot, whenever electrical
power is on the aircraft. When pressed, this sequentially jettisons all
carted pylons on stations 2, 5, and 8, as well as all CFT stores (air-to-air
or air-to-ground). Regardless of the master arm switch position, all
arming solenoids are automatically deenergized before jettison and all
stores are jettisoned unarmed. When airborne there is a possibility of
missile/store collision with the aircraft. If possible, use selective jettison
when airborne (either COMBAT JETTISON or A/G SELECTIVE
JETTISON) to jettison CFT A/G stores first, then wing station stores/
pylons. Ground jettison carries a high probability of collision between
stores/pylons and the landing gear. Therefore, do not use emergency
jettison on the ground, or with both CFT and pylon stores, except as a last
resort or in an extreme emergency.

Engine Fire on Takeoff

Engine fire indications are the illumination of the fire warning light and
the voice warning system; i.e., “WARNING, ENGINE FIRE, RIGHT.” If
the decision is made to abort the takeoff, handle the abort. Once the
aircraft is under control, push the illuminated fire warning light. Ifthe
light remains on, then shut down the engine and discharge the
extinguisher. Based on the condition of the fire, coordinate with the
emergency crew prior to shutdown, then egress.

If the takeoff is continued, climb to a safe altitude (2000' AGL) and handle
as an engine fire in flight.

IN FLIGHT
Engine Fire In Flight

Reduce the power to IDLE on the affected engine. If the light remains on,
push the fire warning light. This will shut down the engine by closing the
airframe mounted fuel shutoff valve. Move the throttle to OFF and
discharge the extinguisher. If the light goes out, check the fire warning
system to confirm that the system is still operational. If the extinguisher
is discharged, do not restart the engine unless absolutely necessary. If the
fire persists, ejection is recommended.

Engine Fails to Respond to Throttle Commands

Landing with an engine that is stuck above IDLE may produce
unacceptably high airspeeds for approach and excessive landing rollout
distances. If the excessive thrust is not controllable, engine shutdown
may be required to properly control landing speeds and landing distances.
Attempt to configure for landing prior to engine shutdown. Restarting an
engine that has had a stuck throttle, and required the use of the fire
button to shut it down, will probably result in a hot start. The use of high
G turns and the speedbrake should be sufficient to control airspeed in
order to configure for landing.

D-9 ACG-9


Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_16.jpeg:
If the throttle will not shut down the engine, depressing the fire button
should shut off the fuel flow and shut down the engine. You may
experience pops, fireballs, and FTIT overtemp as residual fuel passes
through the engine fuel control.

Be prepared to transition to single engine operation as you shut down the
engine. The loss of the hydraulics on the affected side will cause the CAS
to fall off. Reset them. If you accelerate to 300-350 knots, the hydraulic
pumps may be operational again due to windmill rpm. The CAS will fall
off as you decelerate. Reset them. If you shut down the engine on final,
the loss of the CAS may impact handling qualities in the landing zone.
Shutting down the engine prior to glide slope intercept is sufficient to
stabilize the aircraft before you approach the runway.

Single Engine Stall/Stagnations

Engine stalls normally produce an audible pop, bang, or thud, but may
occur without audible warning. For severe stalls at MIL or above, rpm
rollback, increased FTIT and nozzle opening may be noted. Stalls are
usually self-clearing, but reducing the throttle to MIL for AB stalls and
IDLE for non-AB stalls will aid in recovery of the engine. If the stall does
not clear, the engine must be shut down and restarted.

Stagnations are characterized by rising FTIT and decreasing rpm (throttle
not moved). FTIT overtemp will damage the engine. Without audible
stall warnings and without accompanying fire plume due to the
stagnations, the first indication of a stagnation may be the generators
dropping off the line.

For a single engine stall/stagnation, reduce the throttle to MIL/IDLE and
confirm the engine heat is OFF. If the rpm continues to decrease below
IDLE and the engine does not respond to throttle commands, shut down
the engine and perform a restart. If the FTIT exceeded 1000° C, leave the
engine at IDLE.

ACG-9 D-10


Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_17.jpeg:
Double Engine Stall/Stagnation/Failure

Double engine flameout can be caused by failure of all boost pumps, empty
feed tanks, or mechanical failure of both engines. If both engines fail,
lower the nose to maintain 350 knots. It is critical to keep at least one
engine at a rpm that will provide hydraulics for the flight controls and
emergency generator. At 350 knots the engine will windmill at 12%. If
both engines stagnate, leave one engine stagnated while restarting the
other engine. The stagnated engine will provide the necessary hydraulics.
Once the first engine indicates a restart, shut down and restart the second
one to minimize the damage due to the FTIT overtemp.

Restarts

Spooldown airstarts are the preferred method to restart the engines in
that a spooldown airstart is faster than using the JFS. After shutting
down the engine, move the throttle to midrange as the rpm decreases
through 30-50% and the FTIT is below 800° C. If the rpm is allowed to
drop below 12%, engine fuel flow/ignition may not be available. Airspeeds
below 250 knots (primary mode) and 275 knots (secondary mode) may
produce hot starts. If the rpm drops below 12%, 450 knots may be
required to regain 12%. If accelerating to 450 knots is not feasible, JFS
restart should be utilized.

JFS restarts are very similar to ground starts. Adhere to the rpm limits
for starting the JFS and for engaging the JFS to the engine. Restart
envelope for using the JFS is below 20,000 feet and below 450 knots.
Airspeed for a JFS airstart can be as slow as 200 knots if dive angle and
altitude are critical. Restarts below 200 knots are not recommended due
to possible engine hot start.

Extreme Cockpit Temperatures

If cockpit temperatures cannot be maintained in AUTO, switch to
MANUAL and adjust the cabin temperature control knob. If the
temperature is still unacceptable, pull the emergency vent handle (below
FL 180). This allows ram air to enter the cockpit as a function of handle
extension. If temperature is hot at low altitude, consider climbing to
cooler air and/or decelerating. Optimum ram air cooling is obtained at
400 knots and 15,000 feet.

Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_18.jpeg:
Smoke And Fumes

Smoke or fumes from the engine or residual oil in the ECS ducts can enter
the cockpit via the air conditioning system. This blue grey smoke has a
pungent odor and may sting the eyes. It may be noticed during run-up or
takeoff roll. An electrical malfunction, on the other hand, or overheated
cockpit equipment, may generate white or grey smoke, but should not
cause an open cockpit fire since these avionics use little electrical current.
Additionally, there are no fuel or hydraulic lines near the cockpit, so the
possibility of a cockpit fire is remote. All unidentified odors should be
considered toxic. Select 100% and EMERGENCY on the oxygen
regulators. Positive pressure prevents smoke and fumes from entering
even a leaky mask. Do not use the bailout bottle since it will vent into the
aircraft system unless the oxygen supply hose is disconnected. This would
allow smoke and fumes to enter the mask. If required, turn and pull the
emergency vent handle (below FL 180). If electrical smoke is confirmed,
turn off all your nonessential avionics and head for home. Consider
jettisoning the canopy if visibility becomes a problem, but realize this may
cause an eruption of flames. If none of these actions suffice, switch the
emergency generator to MAN and confirm emergency boost pump
operation (BST SYS MAL off and EMER BST ON illuminated). Turn off
both main generators. If the fire persists, place the emergency generator
in ISOLATE. This limits the generator to powering the emergency boost
pump, the engine monitor indicator, tail hook, and slipway door. If, after
reducing electrical load to this point, the fire becomes intolerable, eject. If
a fire is the reason for ejection, the WSO should make sure the command
selector valve is rotated to the AFT-INITIATE position. This will ensure
that the pilot is ejected even if incapacitated due to wind rush fanning the
fire.

Fuel Transfer Failures

The aircrew may be alerted to fuel transfer problems by one or more of the
following:

e premature BINGO caution (fuel transfer problem with external tanks
and/or CFTs),

e FUEL LOW warning with fuel remaining in tanks other than the
feed tanks,

e abnormal fuel quantity gauge indications during fuel checks,
e XFER pump caution, and

e heavy wing (external wing tank transfer problem—this clue will likely
be masked by the AFCS).

ACG-9 D-12


Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_19.jpeg:
The exact sequence of aircrew actions may be influenced by the
seriousness of the resulting fuel state. If fuel available is critical, get the
aircraft pointed toward a suitable landing field and declare minimum or
emergency fuel, as the situation dictates. Both the Inflight Guide and the
Dash 1 checklist provide guidance for recovery utilizing a minimum fuel
profile. Use the fuel gauge to determine where the nontransferring fuel is
located.

Considering fuel available versus that required and possible fuel
imbalances may lead the aircrew to select stop transfer on the CFT's or
external tanks to prevent exacerbating a lateral imbalance. Large lateral
imbalances (one full/one empty external wing tank) dictate an 18 unit
AOA final. Other fuel imbalances (forward CG with Tank 1 transfer
failure/aft CG with external tank transfer failure) may require careful
maneuvering/controllability checks/18 units AOA finals considering the
external stores load or if AFCS problems occur in conjunction with
trapped fuel. In such circumstances, jettison of external tanks/stores
should be considered.

Restoring transfer of trapped fuel is the usual alternative. Cycle fuel
transfer switches—physically move them. Remember the landing gear
handle down depressurizes the external tanks (prevents transfer) as does
an open slipway switch. The slipway switch in the open position also
interrupts transfer of Tank 1 fuel, CFT fuel, and external tank fuel.

Do not depend on trapped fuel gravity transferring to the feed tanks.
Gravity transfer may not commence until very low fuel states (600-800
pounds total) in the feed tanks. And remember, gravity transfer only
transfers fuel at 3500 pph, or less.

If fuel is your overwhelming consideration, trapped CFT fuel can be
transferred by the CFT emergency transfer switch with both generators
off. Select MANUAL on the emergency generator switch and confirm the
emergency boost pump is on (EMER BST) and operating off the
emergency generator (no BST SYST MAL) before turning off the main
generators (and the left/right main boost pumps).

Although the fuel system is user friendly, there is no substitute for

discipline and comprehensive fuel checks for early identification/resolution
of fuel transfer problems.

Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_20.jpeg:
In-Flight Canopy Loss

The most immediate concern is injury to the rear seater. Rapidly
reduce airspeed below 200 knots and descend. The back seater should
lower the seat full down, grasp the lower instrument panel and lean
forward, while trying to retain his helmet/mask. If necessary, select
COLD MIC to reduce noise interference with the pilot’s radio. Land
as soon as practical.

Double Generator Failure

First indications of a double generator failure are the loss of all cockpit
displays with the landing gear light and landing gear warning tone on.
The front cockpit MPCD will display an EADI after a few seconds.

The landing gear light/tone comes on as a result of ADC failure. As
long as the emergency generator and emergency boost pump are
operating, the aircraft can be safely recovered. INS will continue to
function and can be used for navigation purposes. The UFC is still
useable and allows for data entry of steer point coordinates. Steering
information is presented on the ADI.

Hydraulic Failures

Loss of a single hydraulic system is not considered a critical item due
to redundancy in system design. Refer to the hydraulic flow diagram
for systems affected with the loss of a single/dual system. Loss of UTL
A or total utility failure requires emergency gear lowering and an
approach-end arrestment is recommended. Loss of UTL A plus PC2A
loss also requires a controllability check. With multiple checklists to
accomplish, time must be managed to ensure all steps are performed.
Be careful not to mix the checklists. For example, for UTL A and
approach-end arrestment, do not pull emergency brake/steer handle
after the nosewheel is on the ground. Take the cable with feet off the
brakes, control the rollback with power and then use the emergency
brake/steer to stop forward motion. If you were to pull emergency
brake/steer after the nosewheel is on the ground, the airspeed is still
well above 100 knots and the tires would probably blow.

ACG-9 D-14


Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_21.jpeg:
LANDING
Landing Gear Emergency Extension

Pulling the emergency landing gear handle bypasses the normal electrical
and hydraulic controls and ports JFS accumulator pressure to open the
gear doors and unlock the gear. The gear, aided by air loads, then free-fall
to down and locked. If there is UTL A pressure, resetting the handle (with
the normal gear handle down) will restore hydraulic pressure to the
extend side of the gear actuator and close the landing gear doors.
Resetting the handle also allows UTL B to recharge the JFS

accumulators.

Pulling the handle does not blow the gear down. If all gear will not extend
with the normal and emergency handle, the remaining gear can be
retracted with no adverse effects on the hydraulic system (UTL A
available).

During a UTLA or total UTL failure, the emergency system will allow for
gear lowering. The gear doors will remain open without UTL A to close
them.

Controllability Check

If the aircraft has been structurally damaged, or if there is a reason to
suspect poor handling characteristics during the recovery/landing, perform
a controllability check. Climb to a safe altitude and reduce weight to
minimum practical. Once en route home, slow down and configure for
landing. When the gear is down, leave it down; do not configure so far out
that you do not have enough fuel to recover. If you suspect wing damage,
do not lower the flaps. Slow to an AOA/speed that allows acceptable
handling characteristics, but no less than on-speed (20-22 units). If the
aircraft is recoverable, maintain landing configuration and fly a
straight-in no slower than the previously established AOA. Delay
reducing power until well into the flare. Power changes require
corresponding control changes and should be minimized in an aircraft
with questionable handling qualities.

Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_22.jpeg:
Landing With Abnormal Gear Configuration

Prior to landing, consider fuel state, type of gear emergency, arresting
gear limitations, availability of backup gear, runway condition and length,
crosswinds, and other weather factors. If the conditions are not favorable,
eject. If conditions favor landing, refer to the specific gear configurations
listed in the checklist. Empty drop tanks make good skid pads, so retain
them. Depressurize them by opening the slipway, or, if the fuel low light
is on, by turning the air source knob to OFF. Consider jettisoning
armament. Lower flaps and fly an 18 unit AOA flat approach to runway
centerline. Fuel becomes a critical factor if weather complications or other
factors force you to divert to a suitable alternate in an already configured
aircraft. If a go-around (following a missed cable) is not possible, place the
antiskid switch to PULSER to restore braking on an extended main. This
braking, along with nose gear steering, may help in maintaining
directional control.

Approach-End Arrestment

Anticipate a missed engagement and have a backup plan. Reduce your
landing weight, lower the tail hook and lock the inertia reels. Touch down
on centerline 800-1200 feet prior to the cable to allow enough time to
lower the nosewheel before engagement. Once the nosewheel is on the
ground, neutralize the control stick to prevent the cable from damaging a
deflected stabilator.

WARNING

Above 35,000 pounds, an arrestment with
the nosewheel in the air may result in
nose gear failure and extensive aircraft
damage.

ACG-9 D-16


Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_23.jpeg:
Check throttles at IDLE and brakes off prior to engagement. (Once on the
ground consider moving your hand from the throttles to prevent pushing
the power up during the engagement). Dash 1 maximum engagement
speeds are predicated on idle thrust. Control rollback with power and
wait for ground crew instructions. Do not jam on the brakes if the aircraft
is rolling backwards, since you can tip it on its tails—use power to stop
any rollback. Have a missed cable plan for going around or remaining on
the ground.

Departure-End Arrestment

Lower the hook at least 2000 feet prior to the cable if it appears there is
not enough runway available to safely stop the aircraft. Reduce speed as
much as possible before engagement, but do not brake or turn during the
arrestment. Stopping short of the cable and having to raise the hook is
much better than rolling over the cable with the hook up and then
departing the prepared surface. Control rollback with power.

Blown Tires

The antiskid system releases brake pressure due to skid sensing on a
blown tire. For effective braking action with a blown tire, select PULSER
(refer to the blown tires considerations in the ABORT discussion). If
airborne with a blown tire, remember that the ARI is disconnected with
gear down and PULSER selected, so maneuver conservatively. An
approach-end arrestment is recommended to avoid possible
braking/directional control problems. Fly final on-speed (20-22 units).
When circumstances dictate a heavyweight landing, delay reducing power
until well into the flare to prevent an excessive sink rate. If the nose tire
is blown, the engines may be damaged by rubber ingestion. Therefore, it
is doubly important that the engines are at IDLE at nosewheel
touchdown.

If the cable is missed/not available, (or if the tire is blown after landing)
use aileron to help maintain a wings level attitude and relieve some of the
load on a blown main tire. Use the pulser system to slow the aircraft from
landing speed to taxi speed. Brake pressure relief appears to increase in
intensity as speed decreases even though the pulser cycle rate is constant.
Stop straight ahead if possible (antiskid switch - OFF) and shut down
when fire equipment is available. If stopping distance is a problem, lower
the hook for a midfield or departure-end arrestment.

Dive Recovery

If altitude loss is not a factor, any amount of aft stick, airspeed and G
loading that does not overstress the aircraft can be used to pull out of a
dive. However, if you need to minimize the amount of altitude loss during
a dive recovery, then it becomes necessary to control airspeed and power.

As airspeed increases above corner velocity, the amount of room (turn
radius) required to complete the turn also increases. For instance, at 500
KCAS (idle power) using 6 Gs, it takes 4700 feet to recover to level flight
from a 60° nose low condition. However, the same recovery only takes
about half that amount, 3000 feet at 350 KCAS (idle power) and 6 Gs. It
makes sense that if you want to minimize altitude loss, make the pullout
at corner velocity, adding or reducing power as required. Corner velocity
depends on aircraft weight. In our training configuration, it is about 350
KCAS at sea level.

G loading is also a variable in the turning performance equation. Fora
given airspeed, as G is increased, turning radius is decreased. So altitude
loss can also be minimized by pulling more Gs, up to a point. Do not use
full aft stick and 12 Gs to recover from a dive unless the ground is coming
up real quick. You will bend the aircraft. To recover from a 60° dive at
500 knots using 10.3 Gs at IDLE power requires 2900 feet. Recovery from
a 60° dive at 350 knots, AB and full aft stick requires 1900 feet. Also, be
aware of your gross weight. Heavier aircraft feel and fly differently and
you may not have as much G available.

Another consideration to minimize altitude loss during the dive recovery is
awareness of your lift vector. Any amount of bank reduces the vertical
component of lift available and thus requires more turning room to
complete the recovery. Roll wings level for your pullout to minimize
altitude loss.

One of the least obvious (but most important) factors during a dive
recovery is being able to recognize the need for one. In most cases, your
impending dive recovery will probably be accompanied by some spatial
disorientation. (Why else would you be concerned with a dive recovery?)
Be aware that you must quickly recognize your situation and attitude, and
act promptly to prevent excessive altitude loss.

ACG-9 D-18


Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_25.jpeg:
One last point—if everything else fails, know and adhere to your minimum
bailout altitudes! If you are already at low altitude and slow, it may be
necessary to add power (afterburner) to provide maximum G. In
summary, to minimize altitude loss during a dive recovery,

e know your attitude and altitude;

e control airspeed and power. Corner velocity provides the quickest,
tightest pullout (about 350 knots, CFTs and training stores);

e control G loading;
e consider gross weight;
e control your lift vector for a wings level pullout;

e be aware that spatial disorientation may slow your reflexes and add
to your altitude loss; and

e know and adhere to bailout altitudes.

TEXT
BASIC RULES AND PHILOSOPHY

This presentation of emergencies and abnormal operations parallels the
chronological sequence of a flight. The text includes discussions of
malfunctions with emphasis on the logic behind recommended corrective
actions. Sound judgement, common sense, and a full understanding of the
applicable system(s) are essential to deal effectively with emergency/
abnormal conditions. Multiple emergencies, weather, or other factors may
require modification of the procedures.

Under any set of circumstances, you must prioritize what you do to handle
the situation. The first priority is always to fly the aircraft—this is true
whether you are airborne or on the ground—#1, MAINTAIN AIRCRAFT
CONTROL. Although it may seem obvious, experience has shown that
some aircrews do not always do this. They jump immediately into their
checklists and become engrossed with analyzing various aircraft
subsystems, while talking with the SOF/center/wingman/etc. Do not
become a passenger—F LY the aircraft from the moment you strap it on
until you get it back to the chocks and return it to the crew chief.

Your next priority is to analyze the abnormal indications, figure out what
is wrong, and then correct the problem, or come up with a plan to cope
with the situation—#2, ANALYZE THE SITUATION AND TAKE THE
PROPER ACTION. This does not mean running a complete functional
check flight on the entire aircraft; but it does mean you have to know the
aircraft systems and understand how to handle a degraded aircraft. It
also means you need to use the checklist to verify that you have
accomplished the appropriate procedure(s).

Your third priority is to get the aircraft back on Terra Firma—hopefully in
a controlled manner—#3, LAND AS SOON AS PRACTICAL. This should
be done expeditiously, but it does not mean putting the aircraft on the
next piece of concrete you can find (unless you have no other choice).
Modern aircraft just do not come apart around you! There is time for you
to set up a controlled approach for a safe landing. Do not be in such a
hurry to get back on the ground that you rush yourself and get behind the
power curve; i.e., continue to fly the aircraft. However, if you find yourself
with your hands full of aircraft, deteriorating weather, etc., etc., do not
box yourself into a square corner—maintain a safe ejection altitude and do
not hesitate to eject if the need arises.

D-1 ACG-9


Text from ACG-9_Emergency_Procedures__Abnormal_Operations_page_8.jpeg:
So, the three basic rules to follow in any emergency situation are:
@ maintain aircraft control,

e analyze the situation and take the proper action, and

e land as soon as practical.

Some other priorities you may want to consider in addition to the three
basics are: talking, who is running the show, and backup plans.

It is amazing how many people want to talk to you as soon as you declare
an emergency (your flight lead/wingman, center, the SOF, the ranger,
tower, ad nauseam). Resist the temptation to talk to these people and
concentrate on the three basic rules (or at least the first two, initially).
When you have that squared away, then talk. However, do not forget the
person in the other cockpit—he/she can be a big help, so keep each other
informed. Once you have the situation well in hand, inform the rest of the
free world what you are going to do.

And that is the next point—use everyone else to help you, but it is your
show, so you run it. Do not let somebody on the ground put you behind
the eight ball. Have a plan, let everyone know what it is, and then use
those outside agencies to help you.

One last point—the best laid plans of mice and men, etc. Have a backup
plan just in case your original plan does not work. If you do not have one
and need it when everything goes wrong, you may not have time to call an
audible.

In summary, when you find yourself in an emergency situation follow the

basic rules, talk when you are ready, run the situation, and have a backup
plan.

STARTING
JFS Fails to Start

If the JFS ready light does not come on in 10 seconds and there are no
other indications that the JFS is running, have the crew chief check the
JFS system. After the crew chief is clear, wait 30 seconds and attempt
another JFS start.

If the JFS ready light does not come on, but the JFS sounds normal and
the intercom and AMAD fire light work, then the JFS ready light is
inoperative. The light should be replaced before taxiing. Start the right
engine, shut down the JFS, and have the crew chief replace the bulb.

JFS Fails to Engage

The throttles must be in the off position and the master switches must be
on to engage the JFS to the engine. If both of these conditions are met,
cycle the master switch and raise/release the fingerlift again. If that does
not work, do not attempt another start.

JFS Engagement/Disengagement is Abnormal

Once the JFS is engaged, any abnormality requires an immediate JFS
shutdown. Shut the throttle off, turn the master switches off, and
shutdown the JFS. Abnormalities could include no JFS whine increase,
no engine rotation, rpm hangup, or JFS disengagement. If the JFS fails to
decelerate/disengage after either engine start, shut down the JFS and
engine, and abort the aircraft.

If the JFS shuts down after starting the first engine, that is abnormal. Do

not shut down the first engine, restart the JFS, start the second engine
and then the first engine. Abort the aircraft.

Mission Critical Tasks

The dynamic and varied nature of missions dictates mission tasks to be
general in nature, with a “floating” priority (Figure D-3). The four tasks are
situational awareness, navigation, threat, and the aggregation of command,
control, and communication.

Situational awareness (SA), for this course, is the task management process
that controls the sorting and sequencing of mission critical tasks. It is also
the cognitive link between mission and terrain clearance tasks.

Navigation is a single term for everything from time, distance and heading,
to visual acquisition of a turn point or target.

Threat is everything from the use of the tactical electronic warning system
(TEWS) and electronic countermeasures (ECM) to terrain masking and
reacting to an engagement.

Command, control and communication (C*) includes the “routine” chores from
flying formation and communication (radios or otherwise) with your flight
members or air traffic controllers, to getting “bullseye” calls from AWACS or
instructions from FACs.

Mission tasks encompass such things as simple switch changes to complex
mental interpretation and calculation. The internal hierarchy is fluid
depending upon phase and complexity of the mission. It is important for the
crew to distinguish between critical and noncritical tasks, and imperative
that a crew never drop a critical task for a noncritical task (Figure D-4).

How Low Can You Go?

Minimum altitude (MA) is determined by the crew’s finite capability to do
nothing other than terrain clearance tasks (TCTs); i.e., fly low (Figure D-5).
The altitude varies with aircraft configuration, crew proficiency, weather,

The lowest altitude at which you can accomplish your mission is known as
your critical tasking altitude (CTA). In a crew aircraft the prior coordination
of critical tasks may allow CTA to equal MA. CTA varies with mission
complexity, systems degradation, environment, proficiency, etc.

When operating above CTA, time is available for noncritical tasks. Once
terrain clearance tasks fall out of your basic cross-check you are no longer

operating at low altitude. It is this hierarchy which determines “how low you

can go.”

LOW ALTITUDE PHYSICS

The purpose of this section on low altitude physics is to cover the dynamics of
maneuvering flight. Understanding these principles will help you to know:

@ = what to look for,

@ = when to look for it,

@ where to find it, and

@ how to use it.
Straight and Level

Straight and level is the dominant maneuver during low altitude flying. To
properly establish reasonable mission cross-check time, first determine the
time to impact (TTD for typical deviations. First, the time to impact is
directly dependent on the beginning AGL. If you double the beginning AGL
from 100-200 feet AGL, you double the time to impact. It is just the opposite
for TAS; double your speed, cut your time in half. Finally, time to impact
varies approximately inversely with small changes (up to 4°) in the flight
path angle. Double your flight path angle, cut your time to impact in half. In
terms of typical AGLs, speeds, and flight path angles, Figure D-7 depicts
common values. It becomes obvious that the basic variables for straight and
level are AGL and speed. Straight and level flight allows relatively long
mission cross-check times of 3-5 seconds at 100-300 feet AGL over flat,
predictable terrain. However, anymore than 3 seconds at 100 feet AGL is
unacceptable. Five seconds is acceptable anywhere above 300 feet AGL. If
the pilot ever looks away from the vector for more than five continuous
seconds, at or above 300 feet, the deviations become unpredictable. The same
holds true for 3 seconds at 100 feet. These rules of thumb provide plenty of
mission cross-check time for critical tasks without allowing an excessive
deviation to develop.

AGD-01-07

Figure D - 7. Straight and Level Time to Impact Values.

The crew must learn to break up critical and noncritical tasks into 3-5 second
chunks as opposed to counting on a 5+ second mission cross-check time.

Thus, straight and level is a very stable maneuver which allows ample
mission cross-check time even at 100 AGL and serves as the basic low
altitude reference. Because a vast majority of low altitude flying is straight
and level, it is easy to become very comfortable at a given AGL. The difficult
part of low altitude flying is the constant time control, and the fact that
inherent stability of straight and level sets the crew up for a serious timing
mistake in turns and, to some degree, in vertical maneuvers. Low altitude
can also lead to disaster in straight and level flight if deviations attributable
to visual illusions or terrain contour are not detected.

D-11 AGD-1


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_18.jpeg:
Wings Level Bunt

Since you spend the majority of your time straight and level, pacing is based
on its dynamics. The real danger is that once you vary G, bank, or dive angle
all the familiar timing references no longer apply. Straight and level sets you
up for trouble, since it is where you develop a comfort level. While flying
straight and level, a common maneuver is a wings level near zero G bunt. It
is used to increase speed, or lower your vector for a descent, and works nicely
on the back of some ridgelines. The bunt is significantly different than the
straight and level situation because you are intentionally accelerating your
body toward the ground. At 480 knots with zero G you may feel or perceive
yourself as floating, but you are actually accelerating toward the ground,
with a forward TAS. The altitude lost is equal to one-half the acceleration
times the square of the time. This means in three seconds you lose nine
times the altitude you lost in the first second. Airspeed determines flight
path angle during the duration of the bunt. The faster you go, the less the
nose drops. This makes the altitude loss much less obvious from the cockpit
at high speeds; so be aware of the rapid, yet insidious, descents.

Figure D-8 shows the resulting aircraft positions for zero G bunts at 240 and
480 knots. In both cases, the bunt is held for the same amount of time, and
both lose the same altitude, but their forward velocity is different. The result
is different flight path angles after the same time.

Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_19.jpeg:
To provide some specific times for calculating mission cross-check time,
Figure D-9 shows some typical impact times for the zero G bunts. Again,
notice that airspeed does not affect time to impact. The wings level bunt
loses altitude very rapidly, and therefore, should be fully monitored by both
crew members, if possible.

480 KTS

NOTE: AIRSPEED HAS NO EFFECT ON TTI

AGD-01-09

Figure D - 9. Wings Level Bunt Time to Impact (Zero G).

Unlike straight and level, which requires only 30-50 feet to stop a 1° descent
(about 1.5 seconds prior to impact), the bunts need to be stopped and recovery
started before 50% of the time to impact is used up. In this case, the crew
can hold a zero G bunt from 500 feet AGL for only a little over 2.5 seconds
before a recovery must be started. The caution is one of ensuring the pilot
controls the duration of the bunt (time control) and limits the maximum dive
angle achieved to -10° (as a rule of thumb).

LOW ALTITUDE MANEUVERS
Vertical Maneuvers

Vertical maneuvers include three basic types: steady state dives, high-low
transitions, and low-high-low pop-ups. The tactical applications include long
steady descents from high altitude, base position roll-ins for weapons
delivery, slices for low altitude intercepts, and pop-ups for minimum exposure
weapons delivery. Unlike straight and level, the vertical maneuvers are used
to intentionally lower the AGL and involve flight path angles from -5° to as
steep as -90°.

There are three rules to ensure safe vertical maneuvering over a wide range
of tactical situations. The “dive recovery rules” are used for the steady state
descents. The “50% rule” is used for the high-low transitions. The “10° rule”
is used for the low-high-low maneuvers. When properly applied, these rules
allow the crew to exploit the full maneuvering envelope with the least
amount of terrain clearance tasking, which allows more concentration on
mission critical tasking.

AGD-1 D-14


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_21.jpeg:
Dive Recovery Rules

As a basic rule, to descend a few hundred feet, use a negative flight path
angle equal to the desired altitude loss in hundreds of feet. For example, to
lose 400 feet, use a -4° flight path angle and monitor the altimeter and visual
cues for recovery. This simple relationship works well up to the 5° descent
where the “dive recovery rule” AGL should be used. Dive recovery rules, used
for steady state descents, are simply five AGL and flight path angle
combinations which determine when to start a recovery to level flight to
ensure ground clearance (Figure D-10). For those that routinely drop bombs,
some of the numbers are familiar. For those not accustomed to pointing the
nose of the aircraft at the ground, they seem low. After the pilot gains
proficiency with the HUD and radar altimeter cross-check required for this
maneuver, the crew finds that their terrain clearance tasks required for rapid
descents to low altitude are significantly reduced, freeing more mission
cross-check time. In practice, a 10° descent is best in terms of balancing
rapid descents with ease of cross-check.

Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_22.jpeg:
50% Rule

For high-low transitions, use the 50% rule to find the maximum safe flight
path angle for a 90° turning roll-in. The flight path angle is equal to 50% of
the preroll-in AGL in hundreds of feet (Figure D-11). For example, if the
crew’s current AGL is 4000 feet, they can safely accomplish a 90° roll-in to a
maximum of a 20° dive. If their AGL were 2000 feet, 10° would be the
maximum. This rule can easily be applied to repositioning on a target from a
pop-up or rolling in on a tactical target from a wheel pattern. Obviously,
because of the variability associated with roll-in techniques, this rule is not
as precise as the dive recovery rules. The 50% rule ensures that by the time
the crew establishes the calculated flight path angle, they are at or above the
“dive recovery rule” AGL for that flight path angle. If you turn less than 90°,
you have a bigger buffer. If you turn more than 90°, you may have no buffer
and may end up below the dive recovery AGL. Note that the 50% rule does
not take into account safe escape, fuzing, or weaponeering considerations—
only ground clearance.

10° Rule

The 10° rule applies to the low-high-low maneuvering such as vertical jinks
over flat terrain. It can be used without any reference to altitude because it
relies on the control of time and geometry to ensure terrain clearance. It is
dead reckoning through the vertical. Simply stated, the 10° rule is start
rollout at or before a dive angle equal to your highest observed climb angle
minus 10°, and start pullout at or before a time equal to the time spent in the
climb. For example in Figure D-12, the climb flight path angle is equal to 20°
and the climb is held for five seconds. The rollout from the inverted pull at
the top is started at 10° of dive angle (climb angle minus 10), and the nose
drops an additional 5° during the roll. The descent is held for five seconds
(equal to the time in the climb), and then the dive pullout is accomplished to
level flight.

D-17 AGD-1


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_24.jpeg:
The 10° rule allows unlimited tactical use of the vertical maneuvering
envelope of the aircraft while ensuring safe terrain clearance, because the
descent is 5° less than the climb, making it an altitude gaining maneuver.
However, there are several factors which define its limits. The first factor is
the rate of pull-up and pull-down. To preserve the geometry-time
relationship, the inverted pull-down must always be equal to or faster than
the pull-up. The second factor is the airspeed during the maneuver.
Obviously, if you are slower during the descent than the climb, you will have
more buffer; faster during the descent, less buffer. Third, the rule is based on
the same assumptions for the pullout as the dive recovery rules. Safe
recovery is ensured if the pilot executes the pullout the same. Fourth, the
rule assumes level terrain during the maneuver. If the terrain is
significantly higher during the pull-down (rising terrain, for example), there
may not be adequate altitude to recover. As you can see, time control is
imperative. Simply add extra time to the climb portion of the maneuver to
give yourselves more buffer, making room for more mission cross-check time.

Turns

The final category of low altitude maneuvering is the turn. The time to
impact for the level turn is the same as the zero G wings level bunt with an
added bank angle calculation which magnifies the vertical component.
However, there is a distinct difference between the 90° bank and the zero G
wings level bunt. First, it is extremely difficult to perceive that you are
falling when you have 4, 5, 6, or even 9 positive Gs on your body. Therefore,
your ability to catch an error by any means other than visual is hampered.
The second difference, and by far the most significant, is the bank angle
sensitivity. Even very small bank angle deviations of 5° or 10° dramatically
reduce time to impact for turns when compared to straight and level times to
impact at the same AGL. Once 90° is exceeded you are “pulling” toward the
ground. A 10° overbank is considered as the “typical” deviation. Figure D-13
lists the time to impact for several turns ranging from 2-6 Gs. The first bank
angle is that required for a level turn and the second bank angle, in
parentheses, includes the 10° overbank.

AGD-1 D-18


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_25.jpeg:
The values in Figure D-13 illustrate the importance of controlling the bank
angle and G combination. This table also shows the effects of the
acceleration toward the ground as the bank angle and G increase. With a 10°
overbank, the time to impact values are essentially the same for any turn of
3 Gs or more. The bottom line—turning and looking is a death act.

The mission cross-check times for straight and level have been capped at a
maximum of five seconds. The values in Figure D-15 represent the desired
values; any less and the crew is adding protection (but limiting their mission
time); any added time and they are jeopardizing their safety. With proper
training in task management, the mission can be accomplished safely within
these time constraints.

VISUAL PERCEPTION: OPTICAL FLOW

Optical flow is based on the way objects flow below, around, and past the
crew’s eyes as they fly the aircraft over and around the terrain. From this
information, their visual perception system interprets their rate and direction
of motion. Optical flow is also a function of each object’s location relative to
the aircraft’s velocity vector and the distance to the object. In flight terms
this means the crew’s flight path angle, speed, AGL, and slant range to each
object projected over time. Optical flow can be applied to each of the basic
low altitude maneuvers.

Straight and Level

For straight and level (Figure D-16), objects flow back in a symmetrical
pattern with those directly under the velocity vector dropping in elevation
only under the aircraft. Objects to the side move in both elevation and
azimuth under and away from the aircraft. Objects directly inside the
velocity vector do not move in either elevation or azimuth; if you wait until
they get to the aircraft, you hit them. Those that are either dropping or
flowing outward, you will miss, at least with your eyes.

AGD-01-16

AGD-1 D - 22


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_29.jpeg:
Fortunately, optical flow in straight and level is very sensitive to AGL for a
given speed. As you lower the AGL in straight and level, the optical flow
increases, and you quickly sense an increase in “speed rush,” telling you that
you are getting lower. Initially this works well, but the eye is so adaptive, it
quickly accommodates to any given situation and sets a new relative
reference for detecting changes. This phenomena is called the “speed rush
baseline” because it establishes a relative optical flow reference from which
subsequent perceptual evaluations of AGL and speed are created. It takes
about 30 seconds to 1 minute to establish a new reference, and therefore as
the pilot flies, the perceptual tendency is to get lower and lower, or feel safer
and safer at the same AGL. This could lead to complacency or too much
mission cross-check time, and eventually striking the ground, because it
diverts attention from the primary job of terrain clearance tasks. Therefore,
bring in the absolute reference of a radar altimeter, or suitable substitute, to
periodically “cage your eyeballs” during the straight and level maneuvers.
Further, a visual cross-check should concentrate on the area just below the
HUD velocity vector and look for those objects that are not dropping in
elevation. This area is highlighted in Figure D-17. If you detect an obstacle
starting to fill the HUD, pull instinctively; there is no time for detailed
analysis.

In summary, for straight and level you need to know the following:
@ What to look for—terrain not moving at the velocity vector.
@ When to look for it—every 3-5 seconds depending upon AGL.
@ Where to find it—in the HUD, at or below the velocity vector.
@ How to use it—climb.

Vertical Maneuvers

For the vertical maneuver analysis, a 20° dive represents a good example and
is depicted in Figure D-18. When in a dive, everything expands or flows
outward from the impact point/velocity vector. Unfortunately, the rate of
movement—the only thing the crew can see—gets slower the steeper the dive.
Yet the steeper the dive, the faster you are going toward the ground and the
sooner the pilot needs to pull out. This presents a real problem and makes

accurate visual dive recoveries unreliable. This is what makes vertical
maneuvering dangerous.

As the climb and dive angles of the vertical maneuver increase, the visual
capability to warn the crew of the dangers decreases, unlike straight and

level. This explains the 11:1 ratio in fatalities to exposure for the vertical
maneuvers.

Cues for Detecting Deviations

As already mentioned, optical flow for dive recoveries is insufficient. The
crew must react based on actual dive angle and present AGL. Both are
available in the HUD (this assumes radar altimeter is selected or you are
aware of the area MSL). The crew needs to then apply the dive recovery

rules taught earlier or dive recovery techniques presented in TO 1F-15E-1-1,
Figures A9-17 through A9-20.

Vertical maneuvering summary:
@ What to look for—dive angle and AGL altitude.
@ When to look for it—continuously during steady state dives.
@ Where to find it—in the HUD.
@ How to use it—compare flight conditions with established dive

recovery rules or emergency recovery procedures as appropriate
until intercepting dive recovery rules.

Turns

Figure D-19 shows optical flow in a turn. Objects well outside of the crew’s
turn radius flow parallel to the horizon to the outside of their turn. Those
just outside flow laterally to the outside, but also drop in elevation and pass
the outside wing. The objects on your ground track move laterally but into
the canopy structure and simultaneously drop down in elevation to pass
directly under the aircraft. These objects all pass directly through the HUD
as explained earlier. The objects inside the turn also move laterally and drop
in elevation, but they drop faster in elevation and stop the lateral movement
before reaching the canopy structure and pass off the inside wing.

Figure D-20 provides a vertical (God’s eye) view of a constant G level turn.
The velocity vector represents a line (A) tangent to the turn radius. This

As seen from the cockpit, this line is represented by the HUD velocity vector.
The curved line (B) represents the projected ground track for the turn
assuming the G, bank angle, and airspeed are held constant. By calculating
the turn rate, a time of arrival can be determined for each point along the
ground track. The times for a 4 G, 480 knot level turn are plotted and labeled
in Figure D-20 as tic marks along the ground track. Thus, if an object were
sticking up at point (C), you would hit it in approximately 2.0 seconds, if you
did not roll out partially toward the velocity vector or tighten the turn.

D-27 AGD-1


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_34.jpeg:
By using the velocity vector as a reference and adding in the angle of attack
for the G and airspeed, the positions of several cockpit references can be
overlaid on Figure D-20. For example, the line from the pilot’s eye point in
the cockpit to the canopy bow projected out to the horizon intersects your
projected ground track at point (D) or about the 3.5 second point in the turn.

In other words, your ground track for the next 3.5 seconds is visible between
the velocity vector (0 seconds) and the canopy bow (3.5 seconds) at 4 Gs and
480 knots ground speed.

If the pilot scans from the velocity vector to the canopy bow, he is checking
the next 3.5 seconds of the ground track (Figure D-21). This is well within
any of the mission cross-check times for the level turn. The pilot’s eyes are
pointed in the optimal spot for seeing nose slice and provides easy
interpretation of the HUD velocity vector for precise control of the level turn.
If a hard-to-see object “pops up” under the canopy bow but before the velocity
vector, the pilot should roll out and let it pass to the inside of the turn. The
top of the HUD combining glass provides a 2.0 second warning.

AGD-1 D - 28


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_35.jpeg:
Nose slice to the inside of the turn is the most dramatic cue for controlling
the level turn. The amount of nose slice and therefore the ease with which it
can be seen is a function of airspeed, altitude and environment. The faster
you go, the less nose slice you see for a given overbank. The time to impact
and the time required to stop it are the same, but a slow speed deviation is
easier to see than a high speed deviation. The closer to the ground the more
obvious the nose slice is. If there is very little background against which to
see the nose slice, it is harder to detect. The classic cases are over water,
haze, weather, or at night. As stated, the nose slice and HUD are the two
cues to monitor on a 1, 2, or 3 second basis and that implies looking
essentially right out the front of the aircraft (Figure D-22). When the pilot’s
cross-check is through the HUD to the canopy bow, he will protect the crew
from the low contrast, hard-to-see objects, and have their eyes in the best
spot to see the nose slice and monitor the velocity vector for precision. WSOs
should monitor this too, using the HUD repeater, particularly when the pilot
is checking six or is inside the cockpit. The crew can take 1-2 second glances
into the turn to anticipate rising terrain.

Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_36.jpeg:
The crew now knows:
@ What to look for—nose slice to the inside of the turn.
@ When to look for it—every 1, 2, or 3 seconds, depending on AGL.

@ Where to find it—out the front of the aircraft; between the velocity
vector and the canopy bow.

@ How to use it—reduce the bank angle or roll out to stop the nose
slice.

RIDGE CROSSINGS

Now that you have heard the basics of low altitude maneuvering, let us move
on to some tactical applications. Crossing ridge lines in high threat areas can
be a dangerous maneuver. The aircraft is highlighted to both ground and air
threats, so minimizing exposure is paramount. The type of crossing you
execute will depend on your comfort level and knowledge of the terrain.
Detailed route study is essential, especially when flying a mission over
terrain you are seeing for the first time. Ridge crossings should be avoided if
at all possible, but obviously, many situations will force you to cross a ridge.
Plan for and practice good ridge crossing techniques. The three types of ridge
crossings that are commonly employed are perpendicular, parallel, and
saddle.

AGD-1 D - 30


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_37.jpeg:
Perpendicular

This crossing minimizes enemy radar or visual acquisition but should be done
only when you know your 6 o’clock is clear (Figure D-23). Accelerate as
required to maintain tactical airspeed during the pull-up. Pull early enough
to avoid a large overshoot crossing the ridge, so you crest the ridge at your
specified minimum low level altitude. To go down the back side, bunt or roll
and pull, depending on the terrain. A totally inverted pull-down is
prohibited. The roll and pull technique is most effective when crossing large,
steep, isolated ridge lines. A bunt or pushover is more appropriate for milder,
rolling terrain. The advantages of the bunt are straight line navigation, no
wing flash, and less crew disorientation. Remember the zero-G transient and
10-second negative-G restrictions. To execute the roll and pull technique,
unload and roll to approximately 120° of bank, then slice down. At the
desired nose low position, roll out and resume level flight. Initial attempts at
this technique should be limited to a 15° nose low attitude. DO NOT bury the
nose in the new valley. This maneuver may put you belly up to unexpected
high terrain on the other side of the mountain. Consider wing flash during
the slice/pull-down; it is highly visible.

AGD-01-23

D-31 AGD-1


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_38.jpeg:
Parallel

This type of approach is appropriate if your 6 o’clock is or may be threatened
(Figure D-24). It denies the bandit a blue sky background and provides a
difficult guns environment. Instead of a straight approach to the ridge, turn
to arrive at the pull-up point with approximately 45° of crossing angle to the
ridge. Pull up later than for a perpendicular crossing, and continue to turn in
the climb to be parallel to the ridge crest just below the top. The maneuver
at the crest is flown similar to the pull-down during a pop-up attack. Roll
and pull into the ridge, crossing the crest at or slightly above your specified
minimum low level altitude. Continue a loaded roll to fly down the backside
of the ridge, on a heading 90-135° from the ridge line. Roll out and continue
the low level.

AGD-01-24

AGD-1 D - 32


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_39.jpeg:
Saddle

The saddle type ridge crossing is similar to the parallel and should be used if
the opportunity presents itself (Figure D-25). Turn parallel to the ridge line
below the crest until you can use a saddle, canyon, or the end of the ridge line
to cross to the other side. The exact maneuver is dictated by terrain
characteristics. It may be as simple as a level 90° turn or a check turn right
or left to fly through an approaching gap in the ridge. A climb may not be
necessary, allowing you to continue terrain masking or stay below threat
radar coverage.

LOW ALTITUDE INTERCEPTS

There are some unique problems associated with executing an intercept
against a low altitude target, especially if he has his speed up. It may not be
overly difficult to achieve MRM parameters in this situation, but if a VID or
conversion for a SRM shot is required, the intercept is more difficult. The
problems with a low, fast flier are generally two-fold; first, getting around the
corner for a stern VID or SRM shot with enough speed to close, and second, to
make the corner at low altitude without running into the ground. Both of the
problems can be solved with the same technique. Use a “ramp” down or
slicing approach path with 40-50° offset (depending on aspect). Start your
conversion no later than a 14 aspect angle. Continue downhill at bandit
airspeed or faster on a pure pursuit curve and slide toward the target’s

6 o'clock. Make your descent gradual enough to avoid a square corner near
the ground and, at the same time, make your conversion turn gradual enough
to preserve your airspeed; thus, a large offset and early turn. Do not be ina
big hurry to give up an altitude advantage. Altitude can be used to reduce
turn radius, maintain a mach advantage, and provide potential energy for the
conversion turn. Prior to descending to target altitude, check your weapons
capabilities. Your best shot may not be “look up.”

The technique just described is used when attacking a bandit from a higher
altitude, or “high-to-low.” The high-to-low, low-to-low, and low-to-high
intercept options will be practiced during your training.

High-to-Low

Ground controlled intercept (GCI), AWACS, and the F-15E radar will enable
detection of low altitude threats. Beyond visual range (BVR) rules of
engagement (ROE) will simplify employment, but certain situations will
dictate a conversion into the low altitude regime to employ weapons. Target
terrain masking, camouflage, and lost radar locks due to gimbal limits, beam
clutter, or intervening terrain all complicate a kill at low altitude. Strict
radar discipline and visual search is required to clear the area around the
bandit and avoid being sandwiched. Get the majority of the conversion turn
completed early to enable concentration on the target and ground avoidance
during the last part of the conversion. Some common errors encountered
during the conversion follow.

Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_41.jpeg:
Intercepting a shadow instead of the target.

@ Failing to get a tally.

@ Target fixation.

@ Excessive airspeed going downhill, leading to an overshoot.
@ Late conversion turn, leading to a cold rollout.

@ Mistaking high speed for closure and pulling power too early,
resulting in a cold rollout.

@ Insufficient offset, leading to visual blanking of the target under
your nose while pulling lead to complete the intercept.

@ Attempting to stay nose-on or in-plane once the conversion is
started. Accept an offset rollout to avoid steep pitch attitudes and
insufficient ground clearance.

Low-to-Low

Many of the problems encountered in the high-to-low intercept remain in the
low-to-low situation. Intercept execution is similar to the high-to-low but
without the use of the vertical. Terrain masking by the bandit is much more
of a problem, and dead reckoning the bandit’s position may be required.
Because the terrain is a constant threat, normally the WSO runs the radar
and intercept. If the WSO needs to check 6 o’clock, the pilot may need to take
over the radar and intercept. In this case, a climb may be necessary for ease
of cross-check. Radar employment over flat terrain should be effective, but if
a ridge line is in the way, climbing may be the best option. Finally, the lower
you are, the more weapons employment becomes a problem due to line of
sight, collision course profile, and clutter.

D- 35 AGD-1


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_42.jpeg:
Low-to-High

Low-to-high conversions require evaluation of both vertical and horizontal
turning room The optimum maneuver is a chandelle to the bandit’s low

6 o'clock, never leaving his blind zone. If there is not enough vertical turning
room alone (minimum 5000 feet), gain more lateral and horizontal turning
room with offset geometry. Obtaining a tally is not generally difficult unless
there is a large altitude delta or low sun angle. If a large altitude delta
exists, climb earlier to preserve airspeed during rollout. Although terrain
avoidance is less of a problem in this scenario, avoid a square corner endgame
which results in a slow airspeed, nose high attitude at low altitude. In this
case, accept an overshoot in the bandit’s blind zone while preserving your
energy. Remember, after flying at very low altitudes, 2000 feet seems like
plenty of vertical turning room. Do not be fooled by this illusion.

Airspeed Control

Positional advantage requires recognition of airspeed, G-loading, and aspect
while restricted to single-plane maneuvering. The factor most affecting
single-plane maneuvering is airspeed. Increased airspeed is required to close
if the target separates, but once the target executes a defensive turn, the
attacker must reduce airspeed to prevent a flight path overshoot. Control
overshoots with lag, as use of the vertical increases the chance for detection
by enemy air and ground threats. The deeper in lag you go, the faster you
can fly and still maintain positional advantage. Fly to maintain tally and a
positional advantage while not highlighting your aircraft to other enemy
fighters.

Weapons Employment

Because low altitude shrinks aerodynamic envelopes and provides IR and
radio frequency (RF) clutter, valid weapons parameters are more difficult to
achieve. These restricted envelopes increase maneuvering and pursuit time
for the attacker, and often deny an immediate shot once a positional
advantage is achieved. Once a tally is acquired, it can be lost by bandit
terrain masking, sun angles, or shadows. An aware bandit may change
course once he realizes the attacker has lost tally, making dead reckoning of
the bandit’s new position very difficult.

AGD-1 D - 36


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_43.jpeg:
Killing a low altitude bandit with a missile requires the attacker to launch a
missile so it does not strike the ground and the missile seeker acquires the
target at or prior to launch. The AIM-7 must be launched to maintain radar
LOS through missile TOF. Ensure you have both visual and aural self-track
indications prior to an AIM-9 launch to preclude tracking a hot spot on the
ground.

All missiles attempt to fly a collision course to the target. If the missile is
launched with the target climbing, the missile climbs toward the predicted
impact point. If the missile is launched while the target is descending, the
missile dives toward the predicted impact point and may strike the ground
en route. When firing either IR or radar missiles, a slight nose up attitude
reduces ground impact potential. Flying low to ensure a look up blue sky
shot improves acquisition, but may also result in a missile 1000 feet at

12 o'clock in the dirt if launch altitude is insufficient for the missile to attain
flying airspeed. Refer to AFTTP 3-1, Volume 17 for specific techniques,
tactics, and radar employment considerations.

LOW ALTITUDE FLYING CONSIDERATIONS

There are inherent advantages and disadvantages in conducting tactical air
operations at high or low altitudes. When a crew decides that the situation
lends itself best to operations in the low altitude environment, they must
prioritize their workload and develop an internal clock that allows them to fly
effectively at a very low altitude. Task prioritization and cross-check rhythm
must be adjusted to fit the terrain, weather, and threat situation.
Cross-check frequency is usually thought of in terms of straight and level
flight or a stable 4-5 G level turn; those are not the only—and not the most
demanding—flight conditions facing fighter crew members.

Rules of Thumb

Very low altitude flying demands that each crew develop and maintain great
self-discipline and a cross-check rate that ensures aircraft control in all flight
regimes. Aircrews must not allow other tasks to divert their attention to the
point that collision with the ground is inevitable. The following rules of
thumb can be helpful.

D- 37 AGD-1


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_44.jpeg:
When flying wings level below 1000 feet AGL, cross-check aircraft
attitude and altitude every 3-5 seconds.

In turning flight below 1000 feet AGL, cross-check aircraft attitude
and altitude every 1-3 seconds.

The lower you fly, the less margin for error in control of aircraft
attitude and altitude. This margin is reduced dramatically when
turning at low altitude.

When attention must be diverted to other tasks (e.g., switch
changes, copying target information, checking six, etc.) bring the
aircraft to wings level and place it in a slight climb. If possible, give
the WSO some of these duties. Attention should not remain
channelized for more than 3-5 seconds in this case.

Crew Coordination

Smooth in-flight coordination between crew members requires mutual
knowledge of the operation and interaction of systems. Certain elements of
crew coordination have become standard and those which have not should be
discussed in detail by the crew during the mission briefing. As a general
guide the following crew duties apply.

AGD-1

The pilot’s primary responsibility is aircraft control and ground
avoidance. Terrain clearance is maintained by using visual
references and the radar altimeter. After clearing the terrain
ahead and to either side of the aircraft the pilot can then perform a
quick cockpit check. Since his primary responsibility is looking
outside, the pilot should be less concerned with referencing maps or
other non-HUD data.

The WSO should check six and clear using the briefed visual
search and air-to-air radar. Terrain clearance tasks and mission
tasks should be divided, yet shared. The WSO’s primary
responsibility is mission tasks. The pilot should always tell the
WSO when his attention will be diverted. The WSO can then
concentrate on monitoring the aircraft’s attitude.


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_45.jpeg:
Approaching the turn point, the WSO should inform the pilot of the
MSA, the direction of turn and the course and time (or distance) for
the next leg, when asked. If not asked, the WSO should ensure that
the pilot establishes the desired heading. Further, the WSO should
back up the pilot by keeping track of time, monitoring the airspeed
and any other dead reckoning matters.

If the pilot cannot HOTAS it then he should consider having the
WSO do it.

Cues to Overtasking

Self-observation skills are easy to learn and are required for successful low
altitude flying—the crew must learn to evaluate themselves. The following
is a list of general objective cues to overtasking in addition to the specific
maneuver criteria established in the flying phase.

Poor performance of any basic maneuver

Wasted movements in the cockpit

Missed tasks in a familiar sequence

Missed first attempt at familiar switches

Erratic or indecisive aircraft control (pilot only)

Lack of conscious awareness of managing your task loading
A feeling of operating “behind the aircraft”

Loss of verbal responses, missed or late radio calls

Loss of aural responses, no response to radio calls or voice warnings

D - 39 AGD-1


Text from AGD-1_Low_Altitude_Awareness_Training_page_46.jpeg:
The most important point is to key on each of these cues as the mission
progresses. The cumulative sum of these cues compared to some standard for
a similar set of tasks forms a good measure of overtasking. At times any one
of the cues is enough to “knock it off.” At other times, they just mean a
decrease in performance and not an impending problem. Repeated errors or
consistent poor performance means overtasking that is not being corrected.
When this occurs, climb.

TEXT

This text primarily deals with concerns of the low altitude environment. It
does not, however, address why low altitude flying is necessary.

RISK ASSESSMENT

To make sense of this approach, first analyze the risks at low altitude. The
low altitude environment has contributed to a large percentage of accidents.
Day VFR low altitude flying exposure is approximately 10% of the total flying
hours, yet 57% of aircrew fatalities occur in the low altitude environment. To
increase the crew’s low altitude awareness, this text defines the crew’s
responsibilities and focuses on specific hazards.

As shown in Figure D-1, maneuvering in the vertical and turning at low
altitude accounted for the largest percentage of accidents. Vertical
maneuvering claimed 34% of the aircrews in only 3% of the exposure.
Turning the aircraft while looking somewhere other than out front
contributed to a majority of the low altitude accidents, 52%, with 5% of the
exposure. The important thing to understand here is that maneuvering flight
historically has proven most dangerous. Why that happens and how to avoid
it is the focus of this discussion. To better understand low altitude dynamics,
first break down the crew’s tasking.

LOW ALTITUDE TASK MANAGEMENT

The best way to view the aircrew’s primary job is as a time-shared process in
which they first ensure terrain clearance, and second, take care of the
mission. All tasks may be classified as either terrain clearance tasks or
mission tasks.

Terrain Clearance Tasks

To properly manage terrain clearance, the aircrew must control four specific
tasks (Figure D-2). These prioritized tasks are aircraft control, vector
control, AGL control, and time control (pacing).

Aircraft control is the process of maintaining the aircraft within its flight
envelope of angle of attack, airspeed, and G. Aircraft control is the first
terrain clearance task requirement; without it, controlling vector, AGL, or
time is impossible. Flying the aircraft has the highest priority and is the
pilot’s primary concern.

The second task, vector control, is the process of assessing and modifying the
aircraft vector in elevation and azimuth relative to the terrain.

Third, AGL control is the process of assessing and modifying the aircraft AGL
in relation to the terrain. Vector and AGL are the two physical variables
which define the true boundaries of safe, low altitude maneuvering.

However, to accomplish the mission, the aircrew cannot spend all their efforts
on controlling vector and AGL.

Fourth, time control (i.e., pacing) is the process of mentally controlling the
frequency and duration of terrain clearance and mission cross-check time. It
is the key to proper task management. To accomplish the mission, the crew
must leave the vector and AGL alone for short periods of time. The more
they can leave the vector and AGL alone, the more time they have for mission
tasks. Time control is the hardest to learn, train, and control; yet it carries
the greatest potential for causing ground impact.

Loading an A/G Store

To correlate information, here are the steps to program an A/G stores
load. Assume there are two MK-84s onboard, one each on stations 2 & 8,
and 12 CBU-58s, six on each CFT. When the aircrew brings up the A/G
LOAD format (Figure D-2), the number is visible, but not the type of
stores on stations 2, 8, LC and RC. Also visible is that a centerline fuel
tank is loaded (fuel tanks self-identify).

Text from AGD-2_Air-to-Ground_Programmable_Armament_Control_System_page_11.jpeg:
If the MC/DTM data was loaded before bringing up the display, the
display would have initialized with the MC/DTM programmed legends. In
this case, all the munitions previously loaded on the aircraft were dropped
during the last mission, therefore the legends come up blank. When
munitions are physically loaded on the aircraft, the PACS is able to sense
the correct quantity of munitions, but not the correct type. For ballistics
and OWS purposes, the PACS must be programmed with the air-to-
ground munitions that are actually aboard the aircraft. This can be
accomplished via a MC/DTM, or via the display itself. The MK-84s are in
Group 4. Push the button beside MK-84 and a box appears around the
legend. This shows that it is selected to load. Next, push PBs #16 and
#20; a boxed MK84 appears below the buttons showing what is loaded on
the stations. That is all there is to identifying dumb bombs to the PACS.

Loading a CBU/MK-20

Page 3 of the PACS weapons load menu lists all dispenser munitions
certified for carriage on the F-15E (Figure D-3). To identify the stores
actually loaded on a station, select (box) the store by pressing the push
button next to the appropriate store legend and then press the appropriate
station push buttons. In this example (Figure D-3), box CBU58 by
pressing PB #13; then press PBs #17 and #19 to locate CBU58 on stations
RC and LC. When a dispenser munition is selected and located on a
station it initializes with the default fuze and settings (or AFMSS selected
fuze and settings). At this point, the FUZE LOAD option appears at PB
#7.

Pressing PB #7 brings up the FUZE LOAD page (Figure D-4). Fuzes
compatible with the weapon are listed in the lower center of the display
with the current selection boxed. Pressing PB #4 steps through the fuze
choices. Selectable fuze settings are displayed between PBs #2 and #3
and/or between PBs #14 and #13. PBs #2, #8, #13 and #14 are used to
increment or decrement setting values. Additionally, burst height and
time can be entered by typing a valid entry into the UFC scratchpad and
pressing the appropriate pushbutton (PB #2/3 or PB #13/14). After the
desired fuze and settings are selected, selecting ENTER at PB #10
completes the programming. In the example, the default fuze for the
CBUS8 is the FMU26 with a 2.0-second timer. To select the FMU56,
press PB #4 once. Since the FMU56 is a radar fuze, the altitude setting
appears between PBs #18 and #14. After setting the desired altitude, in
this case 250 feet, press PB #10 to enter the settings.

Tangential Conformal Fuel Tank (TCFT) Stores

When a CFT store is detected in the PACS, TCFT LOAD is displayed at
PB #9. After the weapon type has been identified and entered on the A/G
LOAD display, pressing PB #9 selects the TCFT LOAD display (Figure
D-6). The aircrew can now enter the exact CFT position of each store
loaded on this display. This enables the CC to accurately determine CFT
release sequence in order to apply the correct lateral ejection component,
and provide the proper azimuth steering to compensate for lateral
displacement of the weapon impact point(s) on the ground.

Stores entered on the TCFT LOAD display are also used for determination
of laser masking zones.

The station position legend(s) are boxed when selected and are accepted
when ENTER (PB #10) is depressed. The legend(s) is/are then unboxed
and the station positions are displayed under the corresponding CFT
weapon load (Figure D-6).

With the landing gear handle up, if the aircrew entered CFT position load
does not agree with the PACS supplied quantity, the PACS overrides the
aircrew entries in the following manner:

@ Ifthe aircrew entered too many CFT positions for the quantity
determined by the PACS, the PACS removes the aircrew entered
positions in the release order (IA, IF, OA, OF, OC and IC) until the
quantity matches the positions.

@ Ifthe aircrew entered too few (or no) CFT positions, the PACS fills out
the quantity with positions from the reverse release order.

Other Weapons Loading

Other weapons or stores like AGM-65s, GBUs, ECM pods, etc., are covered
in later, dedicated lessons. As mentioned previously, fuel tanks identify
themselves to the PACS so the aircrew does not have to load them except
in the training mode.

When loading a SUU-20, the aircrew must identify individual bombs
(BDU-33 or MK-106) for each of the six SUU-20 positions. After loading a
SUU-20 on the appropriate station, a bomblet submenu will appear as
shown in the middle part of Figure D-7. The A/G weapon load menu for
the SUU-20 displays the dispenser position numbers 1-6. To load a
SUU-20, first select the type of bombs (MK-106 or BDU-83), then select
the SUU-20 positions, then select enter. The type of bomb (BDU-33 or
MK-106) should be displayed next to the desired position under the
station where the SUU-20 is loaded. The aircraft PACS display tells the
operator the SUU-20 bomb positions (1-6) and type of bomb in the release
sequence. Note that the number of bombs remaining is not displayed;
only the SUU-20 bomb position next in the release sequence and type of
store loaded (Figure D-7).

The SUU-20M/N does not have mixed load capability like the SUU-20B/A.
With the SUU-20M loaded, the PACS initializes with 6 x MK-106s per
dispenser; with a SUU-20N loaded, the PACS initializes with 6 x BDU-33s
per dispenser. The display on the A/G status menu is identical for both
SUU-20M/N and SUU-20B/A. The only difference is bomb types
associated to the SUU-20 itself.

A/G WEAPON STATUS AND RELEASE PROGRAMMING

Once the munitions are loaded in the PACS, call up the A/G display to
program delivery functions and to monitor status. To do this, go back to
the menu and press PB #3, A/G. The resulting A/G display is shown in

Beside PB #5 is the delivery program option legend. A program consists of
the desired weapon delivery parameters and release options. The display
always initializes to the program option last displayed; depressing PB #5
cycles through the four program options. Program the delivery options by
first calling up the desired program number and then boxing the
appropriate munitions. In Figure D-9, the MK-84s on stations 2 and 8 are
assigned to PROG 1. The release options that the crew has are release
mode, release sequence, and drag/fuze arming. Whatever is in CC
memory will be what is initially displayed.

To change a release option, depress the button below it; this blanks out
the legend and brings up the choices for that option at the bottom of the
display. Figure D-9 shows this for the release mode options. Then by
pressing the button below the choice, CDIP or AUTO, enter it into PROG
1 and the display changes back, showing the new option, ready for more
programming.

be used. The minimum release interval is weapon dependent (i.e., the CC
or PACS will ultimately determine the interval at which weapons are
released). If you program a weapon release interval less than the MRI,
the weapons will be dropped at the PACS or CC determined minimum
release interval. Refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1, A/G bombing, minimum
release interval. Now program the desired interval (feet between
impacts). Use PB #12 to change the ten's digit and PB #13 to change

The cross and along track corrections, loft angle and arming time are set
through the A/G delivery display on the MPD/MPCD. Note that each
PACS program has its own set of A/G delivery parameters. After exiting a
specific PACS program and entering another, the desired loft angle,
cross/along track corrections must be entered for the new program.

After completing a delivery program, the three remaining programs may
be used for the remaining munitions or to establish an alternate release
program for the ones just set up. When finished, stay in the A/G display
or exit to something else. There is no harm in leaving one or more
delivery programs blank.

As stated earlier, the PACS is smart and will keep the crew from making
many programming errors. For example, assume there are MK-84s on
station 2 and MK-20s on the left CFT. If the pilot tries to assign both of
them to the same program, as soon as the second munition is boxed, the
boxes will disappear. This should alert the pilot to the mismatch.

MK-82SE, MK-82-AR, and MK-84/AR the nose option selects both the
nose and center arming units and the low drag options. The tail or N/T
option selects either the tail or all three arming units, respectively, and
the high drag option. For the BLU-107, only the nose option is available;
this option selects both the nose and center arming units and the high
drag option.

Bomb on Target (BOT)

For each delivery program (TRNG and CMBT) with a ripple delivery and
a quantity (QTY) greater than 1 selected, a BOT selection is available at
PB #15 (Figure D-12). The BOT initializes to the center of the string
(CTR). The first actuation of PB #15 advances the BOT to the first bomb
in the string. Each successive actuation increments the value by 1 until
the selected release QTY is reached. When the BOT number equals the
selected release QTY, the next actuation returns to CTR. If the selected
QTY is changed and increased, the BOT is not affected. If the new QTY is
decreased to less than the current BOT, the BOT defaults to CTR.

The BOT can also be entered through the UFC. If 0 is selected on the
scratchpad and PB #15 is pressed, CTR is selected. If a number between 1
and the selected QTY is entered in the scratchpad and PB #15 is pressed,
that number is displayed below the BOT at PB #15. If the selected QTY is
greater than the total number of bombs loaded on the selected stations,
that QTY number is displayed at PB #15, but all station and position on
target information is for the last bomb on the string. If a number greater
than the selected release QTY, or less than 0 is entered via the
scratchpad, the number in the scratchpad flashes and the BOT number at
PB #15 does not change.

With an even number of bombs in the string and CTR selected, the target

will be bracketed by the two middle bombs in the sequence. With an odd
number of bombs, the middle bomb will be on target.

Releasing a Weapon

The pilot or WSO will probably not fly around all the time with a PACS
format on one of the displays. So, when ready to drop bombs, bring up the
A/G PACS display (as a technique, many aircrew program an ARMT page
to the A/G master mode on one display). When it initializes, verify the
correct program number is showing. Insure that A/G master mode is
selected, then put the MASTER ARM switch to ARM. This satisfies all
the logic required by the PACS for delivery. A boxed RDY appears on the
display (Figure D-13) and the MASTER ARM light on the RCP caution
panel illuminates. The last step is to press the pickle button. Do not
quick pickle; both computed modes use the pickle button as a consent

switch. Immediate release will not occur in AUTO and may not occur in
CDIP.

NOTE

Although it is not absolutely necessary to have the A/G PACS display
called up, it is the only way to change intervals, weapons and delivery
options. Programs may be changed and the green “RDY” light status

verified on both the A/G PACS and the A/G Delivery Display.

As munitions are released, the stores aboard sensors keep track of the
quantity and update the display. However, these computations are not
instantaneous; it is possible for the OWS to register an over-G condition
while pulling off target based on stores you have already released. When
all weapons on a station are gone, the weapon legend is erased and
replaced by what is left, i.e., RACK, PYLON, or blank if nothing is there.
If a release signal is sent to a pylon or rack station and a store present
indication is still there after the signal is removed, a HUNG legend will
appear. However, in the case of the rack, this does not occur until all
subsequent stores have been sent a release signal.

A/G TRAINING WEAPONS MODE

The PACS training mode works in both A/A and A/G, giving the capability
to simulate any weapons delivery with or without stores actually loaded
aboard. However, the training mode may not prevent the release of real
ordnance (live or inert). The A/G TRNG mode should not be used when
carrying releasable stores. The A/A TRNG mode may be used when
carrying certain releasable stores; restrictions will be discussed in your
flight briefings.

The A/G training mode can be entered anytime “A/G TRNG” shows beside
PB #15. First press PB #15 with the top level PACS menu showing. This
boxes A/G TRNG, enabling the A/G training mode (Figure D-14).

Next, press PB #7, A/G LOAD. All these displays look just about the same
as the actual weapons’ displays except that the A/G TRNG legend is boxed
and the page title shows “A/G Training Weapon Load.” Once in A/G
LOAD, program munitions/stores as desired; the range of choices is made
available by paging through the groups with the STEP button. The
operation is done just as explained previously for actual A/G weapon
programming.

In A/G TRNG, whenever a munition or store is programmed, its quantity
initializes to the maximum number that can be carried on that station,
i.e., six MK-82s on station 2. Cycling PB #6, DECR QTY (a training only
legend), decreases the quantity of each boxed munition by one (Figure
D-15). Depressing the button with “1” showing takes the quantity back to

JETTISON AND MANUAL RELEASE
Selective Jettison

The PACS has several ways to jettison A/G stores from the aircraft, which
in all cases come off unarmed. For the circuitry to work, the pylon, rack or
CFT Bomb Release Unit (BRU) must have ejector carts installed;
otherwise, the firing signal is sent, but nothing happens. In addition, the
landing gear handle must be up or the armament safety switch in
OVERRIDE for the selective jettison circuits to be energized. Nuclear
weapons cannot be jettisoned using the combat jettison (CBT JETT)
options. When presented on an MPCD, the jettison symbology is colored
blue for discrimination.

NOTE

The combat jettison program is displayed in training and is
reprogrammable for the training mode display. However, when

CBT JETT is performed, the system exits training mode and
jettisons actual stores loaded and programmed in the nontraining
mode.

Combat Jettison

The two combat jettison options give a preprogrammed means to
selectively jettison a part of the A/G load (including fuel tanks) and retain
the rest. This could be very handy if you are intercepted en route to the
target and need to run or fight but want to retain some air-to-ground
capability.

To perform a combat jettison operation (landing gear handle up or
armament safety switch in OVERRIDE), the pilot places the selective
jettison knob on the armament control panel to COMBAT. This action
boxes CBT 1 and CBT 2 on the A/G or A/A display to indicate the selection
(Figure D-20). Then by pressing the selective jettison button once, the
stores in the CBT 1 program are jettisoned. The second depression of the
button jettisons the stores in the CBT 2 program. The station inventory is
updated after each release. Keep the jettison button depressed until all
selected stores are jettisoned.

If the jettison knob is rotated back to the off position after the CBT 1
stores are jettisoned, the program will re-initialize to the CBT 1 program;
two depressions will then be required to jettison the CBT 2 stores.

Another way of getting rid of on-board stores is by using the A/G or A/A
selective jettison options. By placing the selective jettison knob to either
A/G or A/A, the A/G or A/A selective jettison display is called up on any

initializes to STORE, as indicated by it being boxed. If empty racks
remain, it initializes to RACK, and if only empty pylons are installed, it
goes to PYLON. Select the option desired, if different than the one boxed,

for safing, all boxed items should depart the aircraft. If a CFT station and
the wing station next to it are both selected, the CFT stores are jettisoned
first, followed about 65 ms later by the other station. The store type and

Emergency Jettison

If the need arises to jettison all carted stores, racks and pylons from the
aircraft immediately, the emergency jettison circuitry is the way. Keep
the jettison button depressed until all stores are jettisoned (Figure D-22).
During emergency jettison, bomb pairs are jettisoned from each CFT (two
bombs from LC and two from RC) when the CFT releases occur. With the

CFT fully loaded, the bomb pairs are positions 1/4, 3/6, and 2/5. The
pairing may be affected if the CFT is not fully loaded. The interval
between releases of bomb pairs from a CFT is 140+20 msec. Emergency
jettison pulse timing is as follows:

Manual Release

In case certain malfunctions in the PACS system do not allow normal
deliveries, there are backup means of releasing A/G weapons armed. Two
positions on the armament control panel, MAN FF and MAN RET, bypass
many computer and display circuits giving both a free fall and retarded
manual delivery capability.

MAN FF - manual freefall position selects a manual store release and
nose-only fuzing option. While the pickle button is held down, a release
pulse train of 35 ms on and 35 ms off is generated (one pulse every 70 ms).
Each pulse releases one weapon from each selected station (Figure D-23).

MAN RET - manual retard position selects a manual store release and tail
only fuzing. The release pulse train is 115 ms on and 115 ms off (one
pulse every 230 ms); each pulse releases one weapon from each selected
station while the pickle button is depressed.

DEGRADED OPERATION

As described, the PACS has a lot of capability to deliver A/G weapons in
many combinations and configurations. When certain components of the
PACS or related systems fail, some capability is lost but, in most cases, a
backup exists. The following information addresses a complete failure of
the particular item; partial failures probably will leave some reduced
capability in the PACS area affected.

Central Computer Failure

If the CC fails, the program functions of the PACS are lost. However, A/G
weapons can still be released using MAN FF or MAN RET and A/G
selective jettison and emergency jettison can be performed.

Multipurpose Display Processor

The MPDP processes the display signals. If it fails, all MPD/MPCDs
appear blank. Manual release modes can be commanded from the FCP
MPCD and emergency jettison is still available.

MPD/MPCD

If only an individual MPD or MPCD fails, the desired PACS display can be
called up on another one in either cockpit and all functions are available.
However, if the FCP MPCD goes completely dead, the manual modes
cannot be used.

Armament Panel

If the armament panel fails, all normal PACS functions are available
except combat jettison, providing the master arm switch still works.
Manual release modes and selective jettison are lost, but emergency
jettison remains. If just the master arm switch fails, A/G and A/A weapons
cannot be released armed (but can be jettisoned safe). If both the selective
jettison knob/button and the master arm switch fail, emergency jettison is
all that remains.

Weapon Release Button

If one pickle button fails, try the one in the other cockpit. Jettison
functions are available if both fail.

INTRODUCTION

The programmable armament control system (PACS) provides the
capability for load and release programming, arming, monitoring, and
releasing/firing of air-to-surface and air-to-air munitions. The system is
made up of computers and processors (CC, MPDP, PACS), wiring,
displays, controls and carriage stations. It is software programmable,
which allows for easy updating and has an extensive built-in test (BIT)
feature that isolates faults down to the specific module for simplified,
rapid repair. This lesson addresses air-to-ground munitions. Air-to-air
and nuclear operations are covered in separate lessons.

A/G COMBAT WEAPON LOAD PROGRAMMING

There are a couple of reasons to tell the computers what is actually on
board. For one thing, the overload warning system (OWS) uses the data
to compute over-G warning information; if it bases its calculations on
incorrect data, the pilot could overstress the plane without knowing it.
Also, the computer uses the ballistics for whatever weapon is entered,
which could make for some interesting scores if programmed for “high
drags” when really carrying “slicks.”

The PACS is also smart in that it does not allow programming
store/station incompatibilities. For example, it knows that GBU-15s
cannot be carried on CF'Ts, so it does not allow the crew to load them
there.

Stations and Quantities

The five air-to-ground weapons stations correspond to PBs #16-20 at the
top of the display (Figure D-1). The number of munitions present on a
station is automatically identified to the PACS. Some stores, like fuel
tanks, self-identify their type. However, the crew normally has to identify

other stores, either through MC/DTM programming or the PACS A/G
LOAD format.

Loading Controls

On the A/G LOAD format, the legends opposite PBs #1-5 and #12-14 are
the specific A/G munitions that can be loaded. Figure D-1 shows the
options available in group 1. The load display will initialize to the group
that was last viewed on for the previous mission. There are six groups
(pages) containing all the munitions for which the PACS has a program.
All six groups are listed in TO 1F-15E-34-1-1. Note the “NONE” by PB #1.
It is used to clear legends under PBs #16-20 in the training mode. There
are also three “SUU-20” legends; SUU-20M is for MK-106s (high drags),
SUU-20N is for BDU-338s (low drags), and SUU-20 is programmable for a
mixed load. SUU-20 dispensers are discussed in detail in AGW-1.
Alternate depressions of PB #10 (STEP) pages through the six groups.
From each A/G load display, it is also possible to change to A/A LOAD by
pressing PB #8, enter the A/G TRNG mode by pressing PB #15, or return
to the top level PACS menu by pressing PB #11. Entering NUC LOAD at
PB #9 is possible only on the top level PACS menu.

Distance Traveled Calculations

In working bombing problems, the traditional time distance relationship
applies:

distance _
time

eed

or

distance = speed x time

As always, consistent units must be used throughout calculations. In most
bombing problems speeds are specified in knots true airspeed (KTAS), times
are specified in seconds, and distances are specified in feet. These are not
consistent units; so conversion is necessary.

The following conversion factors apply:

Inm _ 6076 ft -16 ft

1 knot = = =],
hr 3600 sec sec

A sample calculation is made to find the distance (D) traveled in 5 seconds if
the speed is given as 475 KTAS:

D = speed x time x conversion factor
D=475 kt x 5 secx 1.69 ft/sec/kt
D = 4013.75 ft

Crosswind Corrections

Crosswind corrections (Figure D-2) are generally referred to as “drifting” or
“crabbing.” These terms really only have meaning relative to a fixed run-in
line. If you fly the planned run-in heading and drift toward the target as the
sight drifts toward the release aim point, you are drifting. If you adjust the
attack heading upwind so as to parallel the run-in line, you are crabbing.
Regardless of which method you use, the pipper must end up on the same
release aim point (RAP)—there is only one.

In this example (Figure D-2), the wind is a direct crosswind. For a no drag
bomb, the crab line would be on the run-in line, and for a high drag bomb, it
would be only slightly upwind.

Zero Sight Line

This is the reference from which all sight settings are measured; it is the
sight line which exists at 0 mils. In the F-15E, the zero sight line (ZSL) is
represented by the gun cross and is 2° above the fuselage reference line
(waterline) which is not displayed in the A/G master mode (Figure D-8).

ZSL Angle of Attack (AOA)

ZSL AOA is the angle between the ZSL and the flight path vector. AOA is
related to gross weight, calibrated airspeed, and dive angle.

Sight Depression from Flight Path (SDFP)

SDFP is the angular difference between the impact point of the aircraft and
the impact point of the bomb. It varies with dive angle, airspeed, altitude,
bomb range, and is expressed in milliradians (mils).

Sight Setting

ZSL and SDFP are extracted from weapons delivery tables for airspeed and

dive angle, and are summed to obtain sight setting mils to be set in the A/G
delivery display.

AGD-3 D-6


Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_13.jpeg:
Aim-off Distance (AOD)

After release, the bomb is accelerated downward by gravity and slowed by
aerodynamic drag. These factors cause the bomb to travel along a curved
path and to impact the ground some distance short of the aircraft’s extended
flight path. The ground distance between the target and the projected flight
path intersection with the ground is called the aim-off distance (Figure D-4).
It is important to understand AOD, since it is a basic parameter for manual
bombing, and is also important for computed deliveries. It is the ground
distance subtended by SDFP at release. This distance can be computed using
triangulation, or it can be determined using Dash 34 charts. Once the
distance is known, an aim-off point (AOP) can be determined. This AOP does
not change throughout the pass and is useful for rollout and for tracking
analysis. The best wind-corrected reference for the AOP is the velocity
vector. In other words, during a perfect dive bomb pass, the velocity vector
remains exactly on the aim-off point.

TYPES OF MANUAL WEAPONS DELIVERIES
Level

The term “level delivery” refers to any attack with a planned delivery angle of
0-4° of dive/climb. This type of delivery is normally conducted at low altitude,
but can be conducted at any altitude.

Release Conditions

The release parameters are relatively easy to achieve. Probably the most
difficult parameter to achieve is to be in exactly level flight (i.e., exactly 1 G).
When using a fixed sight, small pitch deviations cause significant range
errors.

Using manual delivery modes, altitude is limited by the available sight
depression. You have to be able to see the target over the aircraft nose.

Accuracy

The accuracy of the low level attack is quite good if the target can be
positively identified. This is because bomb range is relatively short. As
altitude and bomb range increase, aiming errors are magnified and accuracy
suffers. Because of this, the level attack is normally a low altitude attack
profile.

Target Detection

For a large target with vertical development, detection ranges are quite good.
Because of the very shallow look angles, if the target is small, hidden, or has
no vertical development, detection may be delayed to the point where steering
corrections cannot be made prior to release. Indeed, the target may not be
detected at all.

Exposure

One of the primary advantages of the low level attack is your ability to avoid
detection by the enemy. However, you are in the heart of the AAA envelope.
At low altitude, your own weapon frag is a threat. A relatively minor loss of
altitude could lead to disaster.

AGD-3 D-8


Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_15.jpeg:
Climbing

The climbing attack refers to any profile involving a release in a climbing
attitude. A long range attack with a low drag weapon released in a climb is
called a loft. The other climbing attack is called the LADD (low altitude
drogue delivery), which is used to deliver nuclear weapons.

Release Conditions

Release conditions are relatively difficult to predict and achieve. Very small
variations in climb angle can result in large range variations. For loft,
release normally occurs 2-4 nm from the target and at a climb angle of 5-40°.
For LADD, release will normally occur virtually over the target and at a
climb angle of 45°. Large climb angles can produce disorienting flight
conditions, and may be restricted by low ceilings.

Accuracy

Bombs delivered from a climb have a long time of flight. Low drag bombs
delivered from a loft have a very long range. The long time of flight means
large wind correction factors, making bombing in a wind quite difficult. The
long bomb ranges associated with loft deliveries (about 20,000 feet) amplify
any aiming errors. These two sources of error combined make bombing of
point targets with general purpose bombs a challenge, at best, using a
noncomputed system.

Target Detection

Since the climbing attack is conducted from low altitude, target detection
problems are the same as for the low level attack. These problems are
further complicated by the very long bomb ranges. In fact, during a loft, it is
quite likely you will not see the target.

Exposure

Once again, approaching at low altitude reduces the enemy’s ability to detect
your presence. However, during the pull-up and recovery, you are vulnerable
to detection and attack. Fortunately, this portion of the attack is short, and
the recovery maneuver itself constitutes a defensive maneuver. Except for
nuclear weapons, escaping weapons effects is not normally a problem.

D-9 AGD-3


Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_16.jpeg:
Diving

The diving attack refers to any delivery profile with a planned dive angle of
5° or greater.

Release Conditions

Release conditions are relatively difficult to achieve during a diving attack.
For the low angle/low altitude attack, release range is relatively easy to judge
and is not terribly sensitive to small variations in parameters. For the high
angle/high altitude attack, release range is quite difficult to judge and is very
sensitive to small variations in parameters.

Accuracy

The accuracy of low angle/low altitude dive bombing is quite good. As dive
angle and release altitude are increased, accuracy drops off; but this is
partially compensated for by better target acquisition, and accuracy remains
acceptable.

Target Detection

Because of the steeper look angle and viewing time, target detection is very
good. In fact, many times a lookdown on the target is the only way to
visually acquire it.

Exposure

For the high altitude roll-in and pull-off, exposure to enemy fighters, certain
SAMs, and large caliber AAA are definite factors and must be considered in
planning the attack. If a pop-up maneuver is employed, exposure is minimal
prior to the pop. In the pop, exposure is high; but if the attack is properly
planned and executed, the duration is brief.

WEAPONS DELIVERY RECOVERY MANEUVERS
General Considerations

Before looking at specific recovery maneuvers, briefly look at some general
considerations. To determine your release altitude, consider safe escape, safe
separation, fuze arming, altitude lost during the dive recovery, and the
desired weapons effect. The highest applicable altitude/time must be used.
Safe escape data from your weapons is given for specific escape maneuvers.
Safe escape from weapon fragmentation and ground avoidance are the
primary considerations in recovering from any attack.

If you do not exactly follow the specific maneuver guidelines, you may
significantly increase your probability of being struck by fragmentation from
your weapons. Safe escape/safe separation data considers all weapon
fragments except an extreme few such as lugs, hardbacks, fuze wells, etc.
The probability of one of these objects being aimed at the delivery aircraft is
very small. It is operationally accepted that with a properly flown escape
maneuver, the probability of being hit by one of these fragments is less than
or equal to 1 chance in 1000 when releasing at minimum altitude.

Safe Escape/Safe Separation

Safe Escape

This is the minimum safe distance between the aircraft and a bomb which
explodes at impact. It is normally expressed as a minimum release altitude.
You must consider this for all bombs. Remember, safe escape does not
consider secondary explosions which may drastically change the frag pattern.
For proximity fuzed GP bombs, the detonation altitude must be added to the
minimum release altitude for safe escape.

Safe Separation

To avoid the frag of a bomb which explodes at the end of the arming time, a
safe separation distance must exist between the bomb and the aircraft when
the arming timer expires. Safe separation is the same distance as safe escape
but is normally expressed as a minimum time of fall, in seconds. You are
required to determine and achieve this for all bombs, but it is critical for
bombs equipped with proximity fuzes and certain CBUs. This distance
determines the minimum fuze arm time setting (allow for negative fuze
tolerances). Positive fuze arm tolerance dictates the minimum altitude
required to guarantee the bomb is armed at impact.

Ground Clearance

Safe escape data provides minimum release altitudes for frag avoidance. In
addition, for diving deliveries, altitude loss during multiple releases and dive
recovery is included for ground avoidance. The data is based on a zero foot
clearance plane. If the wing or squadron does not establish required ground
clearance, the crew must determine how much ground clearance is required
for recovery from a diving delivery.

Detailed instructions on the use of safe escape/safe separation data is
contained in TO 1F-15E-34-1-3 and TO 1-1M-34, Section VI.

Recovery Maneuvers

Minimum altitudes for dive recovery and safe escape are computed in CWDS.
Minimum altitudes are based on the aircrew flying one of the following
escape maneuvers after release.

1. Level Straight Through Maneuver (LST) (Figure D-5). This maneuver is
used with level deliveries only and consists of maintaining a level,
constant speed flight profile for at least 3 seconds plus the TOF of the
last bomb released.

AFTER RELEASE OF LAST BOMB, THE LST PROFILE MUST BE CONTINUED FOR AT LEAST
THREE SECONDS PLUS TOF OF THE LAST BOMB OF THE RIPPLE.

Climbing Maneuver (Figure D-6). This maneuver is used for deliveries
using 0-60° of dive. The maneuver is begun after weapon release with a
5.0 Gin 2 seconds pull. Military power is applied as the nose reaches
the horizon and G is maintained to a 20° climbing flight path angle. Gis
then relaxed as the climb angle is increased to 30°. The minimum
release altitudes for this maneuver allow for bank angles of up to 30°
during the recovery. Once a 30° climb is established, the escape
maneuver is complete and target egress may be initiated.

3. Turning Maneuver (Figure D-7). This maneuver is used for deliveries
using 0-20° of dive. The maneuver requires 5 Gs for at least 60° of turn
to ensure separation and normally results in a descending turn away
from the target. At release, simultaneously select mil power to attain
5 Gs in 2 seconds while rolling as required (60-85° of bank) to initiate
the turn and decrease dive angle to approximately 5°. Maintain the 5 Gs
for at least 60° of turn and vary bank to control flight path vector and
rate of descent. Guard against an increased bank angle and/or reduced
G which may result in a very nose low altitude. If necessary, reduce
bank angle and increase G to ensure terrain clearance while achieving
60° of turn. Failure to achieve 60° of turn may result in
self-fragmentation. Once 60° of turn is achieved, the escape maneuver is
complete and target egress may be initiated.

deliveries using 0-20° of dive and results in a turning escape maneuver

mil power and attain a wings level pull of 5 Gs in 2 seconds. As the nose
approaches the horizon, use a loaded roll (2-5 Gs) to establish a level
turn. Maintain 5 Gs through at least 60° of turn to ensure safe
separation. Again, guard against increased bank angles or insufficient
G which could result in a very nose low altitude or failure to complete
60° of turn in time to ensure safe separation. Once 60° of turn is
complete, target egress may be initiated.

5. Backup Escape Maneuver. This maneuver is designed for use when
unexpected terrain, weather, or threats preclude use of the planned safe
escape maneuver. It is not to be used as a primary escape maneuver.
The maneuver is designed to provide reasonable assurance of safe escape
for most anticipated situations assuming the release altitude is greater
than or equal to the minimum release altitude provided for turning
maneuver safe escape. The maneuver is initiated by establishing a 5 G
in 2 seconds pull. As the nose approaches the horizon, select mil power
and maintain 5 Gs until 20° of climb or 60° of heading change has been
achieved. If executing a climb, relax G at 20° as climb angle is increased
to 80°. The maneuver is complete and target egress may be initiated
when 30° of climb or 60° of heading change is achieved.

Figure D - 9. Safe Escape CWDS.

Two other considerations that must be made are finding a fuze setting that
exceeds safe separation and separation from other aircraft bombs dropped in
front of you.

D-19 AGD-3


Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_26.jpeg:
Fuze Arming Distance

Fuze arming distance for a particular fuze is the vertical distance below the
aircraft where the fuze becomes armed. Most fuzes have several timer
settings. Selection of an acceptable fuze arming delay setting for a particular
mission is based on the safe escape data, type of fuzing (contact or proximity),
and operational considerations. Fuze arming data is computed by CWDS for
release conditions and desired fuze settings. A setting above the safe
separation time is required and will force a release altitude above safe escape
altitude to preclude a dud bomb.

Vertical drop required for fuze arming is independent of release G, but is
dependent on dive angle and TAS. If bomb impact occurs within the fuze
arming distance, a dud bomb is probable. The arming delay setting plus the
positive tolerance and inherent fuze delays are used by CWDS in the
determination of the vertical drop required for safe separation defined in
Figure D-9 as MRA (minimum release altitude). Current tolerances on
arming delays and delays for these fuzes are listed in TO 1-1M-34.

Fragmentation Envelope

In addition to avoiding the fragments of your own weapons, you must avoid
fragments of another aircraft’s exploding weapon. You must know where
their fragmentation will be at any time after an explosion. Within the
limitations of certain simplifying assumptions, this information is generated
and presented in TO 1-1M-34, section VI in tabular format (Figure D-10) and
is also shown at the top of CWDS safe escape tables (Figure D-9, page D-19).
Note that the data in the CWDS product may differ slightly from the chart in
TO 1-1M-34 but appears to be more conservative.

BALLISTIC COMPUTATIONS
Basic Considerations

With the advent of computed bomb release systems, the amount of number
crunching in mission planning has been considerably reduced. There may
still be a need to deliver bombs manually, however. There are several ways
to come up with the hip pocket mil settings you need to carry with you.

TO 1-1M-34 contains planning checklists which provide a step-by-step
procedure to generate mission data. This is by far the most time consuming
method but it works when computer programs are unavailable. However,
some data is only available in the computer and hard copies of common
deliveries should be maintained.

A quicker method is to use one of the squadron’s computer programs to
generate all the mission data.

Data Requirements

Regardless of which method you choose to produce your mission data, you
must bring certain information to the problem.

Target Data

As you begin this phase of a mission plan, you have already determined the
target and the weapon to be used against it. This information is usually
given to you in an air tasking order. You need to know the target elevation to
be able to compute release indicated altitude. Additionally, you need density
altitude, or pressure altitude and temperature, to determine safe escape and
ballistics.

Weapon Data

The specific weapon determines the set of tables to use. You also need some
information about the fuze. Specifically, you need to know the type (i.e.,
proximity, impact, or timed) and the arm time, which may or may not be
predetermined. Last, you must know any special requirements such as
desired area coverage, pattern length/density, or impact angle.

AGD-3 D - 22


Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_29.jpeg:
Delivery Data

Much of this information is determined before you begin ballistics
computations. In some cases (e.g., specific impact angle required), you must
enter the tables with the hard requirements and work backwards to get a
release airspeed, altitude, and dive angle. Whichever approach you take, you
must have dive angle, release airspeed, release sequence (number and
interval of bombs), required ground clearance, and aircraft gross weight. At
this time, you must also determine the type of recovery maneuver you intend
to use.

The Big Picture
Whether you use computed deliveries or manual methods, your delivery and
resulting target destruction are significantly affected by your ability to

position the aircraft precisely.

The big picture as seen from above is shown in Figure D-11.

Procedures

The intent here is not to make you an ace at computing mil settings, but to

review the general process and point out some areas of the procedures that

should be accomplished even when you fully intend to use a computed mode
such as AUTO or CDIP. After establishing your preliminary data, the first

thing you must do is determine the release altitude.

Solution

Release Conditions

The first parameters to determine are release dive angle, airspeed, and
altitude. Release altitude, dive angle, and airspeed are dictated by the
threat, weather, desired weapons effects (i.e., pattern or impact angle), and
aircraft limitations (i.e., external stores limitations and maximum speed
attainable, both from the Dash 1). Altitude must also consider safe
escape/safe separation and fuze arm weapon limitations.

Release Altitude

Since the assigned weapon is a practice bomb, safe separation and safe
escape are not factors. However, the minimum recovery altitude is a
consideration. From Figure D-9 on page D-19, a CWDS product, it can be
determined that for a 30° dive angle, an airspeed of 500 KTAS, with a 5.0 G
in 2 seconds pull, the aircraft will lose 1370 feet during pullout. By adding
1370 to the minimum recovery altitude of 2500 feet, a minimum release
altitude of 3870 feet is obtained. To avoid interpolation problems and to
make release altitude an easier number to remember, the 3870 will be
rounded up to 4000 feet AGL.

Weapon Ballistic Data

After determining munition release altitude, airspeed, dive/climb angle, and
separation it is time to go to the bombing tables in the CWDS computer
program (Figure D-13). This is the only source of ballistic data. Select the
parameters for the specific weapon and delivery profile. Look for an altitude
and TOF equal to or greater than the values determined in the above
procedure. You will need to know the target density altitude or pressure
altitude and temperature. You can now extract the ballistics parameters
associated with your delivery. These data are bomb range, TOF, impact
angle, sight depression from the flight path (SDFP), and the wind correction
factors. Remember that impact angle may be critical and you may have to
select other parameters based on it.

Zero Sight Line AOA

Using the aircraft gross weight, true airspeed, and dive angle, determine the
ZSL AOA at release from the TO 1-1M-34 tables (Figure D-14). Simply enter
the appropriate chart with the entry arguments and read off the AOA.

The sight setting is simply the ZSL AOA plus the depression (SDFP) from the
ballistic tables. This is the number of mils you enter on the A/G delivery
display prior to beginning the attack. For this problem, add 139 mils

(Figure D-138) to 58 mils (Figure D-14) to get a total sight depression angle of
192 mils. Set 192 mils on the A/G delivery display for BDU-33 direct
deliveries or for manual deliveries using a fixed sight. (If bombing using
direct deliveries because of central computer failure, mils are set on the UFC,
Menu 2, PB #2.)

Attack Development

Track Point

This point defines one end of the track point distance, also called the
minimum attack perimeter (MAP), and is where you should stabilize your
flight path and begin to track the target (Figure D-15). To find the track
point, compute the track distance (which is equal to average true airspeed

from rollout to release) times 1.69 (to convert knots to feet per second) times
the planned track time.

track distance = true airspeed x 1.69 x track time

Since average true airspeed is an estimate, this calculation can be less
scientific than it sounds. A sample calculation based on an average true
airspeed of 475 knots and track time of 5 seconds yields:

track distance = 475 KTAS x 1.69x5 seconds = 4014 feet

To find the altitude lost while tracking, multiply track distance by the sine of
the dive angle [in this example assume a dive angle of 30° (Sin 30° = 0.5)].

altitude lost = 4014 feet x 0.50 = 2007 feet
Add 2007 feet to release altitude to calculate track point altitude.
To find the ground distance covered during tracking, multiply the track

distance by the cosine of the dive angle (Cos 30° = 0.866).

horizontal track distance = 4014 feet x0.866 = 3476 feet

Add the horizontal track distance to the bomb range to find the track point
distance.

Track Point ZSL AOA

Track point mils are recomputed and are different than release point mils
because you are at a different airspeed and further away from the target and
aim-off point. These mils will be subtracted from release mils to determine
the initial pipper placement on rollout.

To determine the ZSL AOA you must know the airspeed at the track or
rollout point. You can only make an educated guess based on your airspeed
prior to final maneuvering and the amount of maneuvering planned to

achieve the track point. In other words, make a guess. Using the same chart

as in the release point AOA determination, reenter with the track point

airspeed and find the ZSL AOA mils. If you estimate your rollout speed at
450 KTAS, reenter the chart (Figure D-14) and interpolate between 440-460
KTAS to get 61 mils.

Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_36.jpeg:
Aim-off Distance

The aim-off distance remains constant throughout the attack but is most
useful during the rollout. Using the aim-off charts (Figure D-16) in

TO 1-1M-34, you can determine the required aim-off distance in feet. It is
this distance in feet that remains constant from rollout to release. The angle
subtended by this distance varies throughout the pass and is responsible for
the pipper movement across the ground as you approach the target (not
counting any wind). Find the aim-off distance in feet and a sight depression
angle at rollout by entering the chart with release SDFP.

Using an aim-off chart for 30° dive (Figure D-16), enter with the SDFP

determined from the ballistic tables (139), proceed up to the release altitude
(4000 feet AGL) and over to read the aim-off distance in feet (1775).

Another way to find aim-off distance is to divide release altitude by the
tangent of the dive angle and subtract bomb range from the result.

AOD = release altitude 7

tan dive angle

A sample calculation for a BDU-33 released at 4000 feet AGL in a 30° dive
yields (BR = 5138 feet, tan 30° = .0577):

AOD = 4000 — 5138 = 1790 feet
tan 30°

Note: This is only 15 feet different from the 1775 feet using the chart.

The chart illustrated in Figure D-16 may also be used to determine track
point aim-off distance (AOD) mils. AODtp mils are required to compute
initial pipper placement (IPP). To determine AODt? mils, begin at the left
edge and read to the right from aim-off distance (1775 feet) along the original
line, stopping at track point altitude (6007 AGL). Then read down to obtain
the number of mils which subtend AOD at track point (about 87 in the
example). Use this number to compute IPP.

Initial Pipper Placement

If you take the release sight setting and subtract the AOA and aim-off mils at

is the distance the pipper is short of the target (in mils) as tracking begins.

Base Altitude

This is little better than a guess, which depends on how much maneuvering
must be done and the technique used. For the standard 90° base-to-final
turn (box pattern), altitude lost in the roll-in can be computed by multiplying
the roll-in turn radius by the sine of the dive angle. Adding this altitude loss
to the track point altitude yields the base, or roll-in, altitude.

2
turn radius (TR) = PEAS SAO , Where G, = radial G
Gp X 382.2

In this example, assume Gr equals cockpit G and that roll-in is accomplished
at 342G. Therefore,

2
TR = 450x169)" _ 5199 foot
3.5xX32.2

Altitude lost during roll-in equals TR x sine 30° = 5132 x .5 = 2566 feet.
Therefore, roll-in altitude equals 8573 feet AGL (6007 + 2566).

Track Point Distance

The track point distance is equal to bomb range (5137 feet) plus the
horizontal distance covered while tracking (3476 feet), which have already
been calculated. Therefore, the track point distance equals 8613 feet from

the target.

If a ripple delivery is accomplished, half of the horizontal distance covered
during the ripple release must be added so the middle bomb hits the target.

Base Distance

The base distance is the distance from the target at roll-in to arrive at the
track point (Figure D-18). It is defined as track point distance plus the
horizontal distance covered during the roll-in. This horizontal distance is
equal to the roll-in turn radius times the cosine of the dive angle.

turn radius (TR) x = cos 30° = base turn distance

The turn radius (5132) times cos 30° (.866) is equal to the base turn distance
(4444): plus, track point distance (8613) is equal to the base leg distance
(13,057).

Base leg can be computed manually, or you could do it using the Dive Angle
Versus Distance chart (Figure D-19) from TO 1-1M-34. Enter the chart at
the desired base leg altitude (8573 feet AGL), proceed right to the dive angle
(30°), and down to the distance (14,900 feet). This distance is to the aim-off
point—not the target. You must subtract AOD (1775 feet) to get base
distance (13,125). This is close enough to our calculated distance of 13,057
feet. Rounding the base altitude to 9000 feet AGL would give us an AOD of
about 15,200 feet or a base distance of 13,425 feet vs 13,125 feet which is
close enough to 13,057 feet for most bombers. If you are bombing in a wind,
you need to modify your base leg position. It is generally more acceptable to
modify base leg position rather than base leg altitude. Use about 3 times the
crosswind correction factor listed in the CWDS tables for the type of delivery
you are attempting. (If the correction factor is 10 feet/knot, correct your base
leg by 30 feet/knot).

MANUAL DELIVERIES

Pattern

Base Leg

The secret to manual bombing is to fly a proper and consistent base leg
(Figure D-20). In fact, the most likely cause of poor parameters in a manual
dive bomb pass is failure to establish a proper base leg position. Of course,
the ideal is to be able to look out the canopy and “see” the proper dive angle.
Initially, you probably need to be a little more mechanical than that.

Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_46.jpeg:
Roll-in Technique

There are several roll-in techniques used for dive bombing, but all have the
same goal: to end up at the track point on airspeed and on dive angle. To do
this, you must lead the turn by one turn radius at whatever G load you
intend to use (usually 3-4 Gs). With your eyes on the aim-off point, roll to
bring the point near the top of the canopy (the approximate bank angle to use
is 80°, plus the dive angle). Now, pull the aircraft around to roll out with the
velocity vector on the AOP.

AOD and IPP

As you roll out and the velocity vector moves to the aim-off point, cross-check
your dive angle and initial pipper placement (Figure D-21). Immediately
correct your IPP, if necessary. For most events you have an IPP of 40-70 mils
(44 mils in our example). If you are on track point parameters and your IPP
is correct, the pipper tracks to the target and arrives as you reach release
altitude.

Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_47.jpeg:
Tracking (No Wind)

After establishing IPP, you must allow the pipper to track smoothly to the
target (Figure D-22). Because AOA decreases as you accelerate, you see little
pipper movement initially. This takes about 1-3 seconds of your tracking
time. After airspeed is set and AOA stops changing, the pipper moves toward
the target. The pipper moves the fastest during the last third of tracking
time. Approximately 2 seconds prior to release, the pipper is 25 mils short of
the target (i.e., the top of the reticle is on the target). If you maintain a
constant dive angle, the velocity vector remains stationary over the aim-off
point.

Do no forget to pickle as the pipper intersects the target and you reach
release altitude.

Figure D - 22. Tracking (No Wind).

To kill any 3 or 9 o'clock error, the pipper should track down the run-in line
and the aircraft should pass directly over the target.

If the above tracking indications are not present, take immediate and positive
corrective action. You only have time for one or two corrections prior to
reaching release altitude. If you are still making corrections as you reach
release altitude, it is very easy to induce an error, such as a bank angle or G
error, which will likely produce a miss.

D-41 AGD-3


Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_48.jpeg:
The tracking rules, then, are:
e Make smooth positive corrections.
e Accept small errors to avoid last minute corrections.

Wind Corrections

If you stay in the bomb dropping business for 20 or so years, you may get to
drop on a no-wind day two or maybe even three times. The rest of the time,
you will have to drop in a wind, and the odds are it will not be a head/tail
wind.

RAP (Release Aim Point)

To bomb in a wind and still hit the target, you must make some adjustments.
Essentially what you do is bomb a new “target” located upwind from the
actual target by a distance equal to the wind-caused miss distance. This
distance is found by multiplying the wind speed by the crosswind correction
factor (XWCF) (18 ft/kt) from the ballistic tables in CWDS (Figure D-13,
page D-26).

RAP = wind speed x XWCF

The RAP becomes your new target, and you must meet all your no-wind
parameters with the pipper on the RAP to hit the actual target.

RAPE (Release Aim Point - Extended)

Since your aircraft is being blown downwind while you are coming down the
chute, you must further extend your release aim point upwind to account for
this drift. The RAPE is found by multiplying the wind speed (knots) by 1.69
by [bomb TOF + track time (in seconds)].

RAPE =wind x1.69x(TOF + track time)

The RAPE must be determined for both drift and crab tracking methods to
determine IPP. In either method, the pipper is under RAPE on rollout and
tracks to the RAP at release.

AGD-3 D - 42


Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_49.jpeg:
AOP

For the drift method (Figure D-23), the aircraft rolls out upwind by a distance
equal and parallel to the RAPE. If you use the crab method, the aircraft is
between the target and RAP (to compensate for bomb drag) but the pipper is
still under the RAPE due to the crab. In either case, if the velocity vector of
the HUD is functioning properly, it compensates for the wind and is only
moved upwind from the aim-off point the amount you are offset from the
target at release.

HAIRLINE SYMBOLS - NO WIND

AGD-03-23

Figure D - 23. AOP and IPP Winds.

IPP

Your initial pipper placement (Figure D-23) must also be moved into the wind
by a distance equal and parallel to the RAPE. An approximate rule of thumb
is to use two times the crosswind correction factor.

Your pipper must now track (Figure D-24) from its initial placement to the
release aim point (RAP). The RAP is your new target and the pipper must be
on the RAP at release altitude. However, if you roll out with the proper IPP
relative to your rollout aim point (RAPE) and your flight path takes you
across the target (very slightly upwind, actually), the pipper should be on the
RAP when you arrive at release altitude.

BOMB IMPACT ACCURACY
Noncrew-caused Errors

Inherent Weapon Dispersion

Inherent dispersion is primarily the result of construction variances. As with
anything else, no two bombs are exactly alike. For low drag weapons,
dispersion is about 5 mils. For high drag weapons, dispersion is about 8 mils.
Although the dispersion is greater for the high drag weapons, the shorter
release slant ranges may result in a smaller overall miss distance.

Installation Errors

For free-fall weapons, this is very small. The flight path of a free-fall bomb is
determined by the flight path of the aircraft at release, weapon drag, and

gravity.

Aircraft Systems Errors

The same manufacturing errors that affect weapons also affect aircraft
systems. No two radars, HUDs, or INSs are alike. Further, when it comes to
installing or aligning these systems and boresighting them, a combination of
tolerances may result in some pointing errors. Some of these systems errors,
primarily the error associated with boresighting, are predictable. After a few
passes, you are sure “this airplane drops 30 feet left.” This type of error can
be compensated for by adjusting the aim point. Squadrons normally track
these types of errors in some sort of systems book which crews can review
prior to flight. There is another category of error which is random and is
related to the slop or noise level within a system. This type error you just
have to accept.

Assumptions

All ballistic tables and even the airplane CC make certain simplifying
assumptions before solving ballistics problems. One common assumption is a
standard atmosphere. These assumptions cause small errors in ballistic
solutions.

Crew-caused Errors

Aiming Errors

Pipper Not On Release Aim Point (RAP)

This is normally the result of poor tracking technique or simply a tracking
error. The correct aim point is known; you simply run out of tracking time
before the pipper gets to the RAP. Another possibility is to mistakenly think
the pipper was on the RAP at pickle; this error is normally caught during
postmission tape review. Remember, the RAP is the same as the target, only
for a no-wind condition.

Release Aim Point Not Known

This is a very common situation where winds are concerned. The error is
usually the result of using the wrong wind or a computation error in
determining the wind offset aim point. Additionally, in manual dive
bombing, it is common to make small errors and then make an offsetting
correction to another parameter. Since these corrections are made rapidly,
there is ample room for error. Finally, the problem may simply be the result
of not being able to identify the correct spot on the ground. Whatever the
reason, if you make an aiming error the bomb follows the aircraft trajectory
at release and misses the target.

Parameters

In examining parameter errors there are two general assumptions made: the
pipper is on the target, and only one error exits. This is seldom the case, and
for most errors, if they persist for any length of time, another error surely
results.

Altitude

Munitions released from a higher than planned altitude have a greater than
planned range to travel to the target. Although the longer time of fall
increases the bomb range over that planned, the increase is never as great as
the longer range which exists. As a result, a bomb dropped from a higher
than planned altitude falls short. Conversely, a bomb dropped at a lower
than planned altitude falls long.

AGD-3 D - 46


Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_53.jpeg:
Airspeed

Munitions released at a lower than planned airspeed fall short of the target
for two reasons. First, the weapon simply will not travel as far due to
reduced airspeed. Also, the lower airspeed alters the AOA of the delivery
aircraft and therefore reduces the effective depression. Conversely,
munitions released at a higher than planned airspeed go long.

Dive Angle

If munitions are released in a shallower than planned dive angle at the
planned altitude, the aircraft is farther from the target than planned.
Additionally, reducing dive angle increases required sight depression. These
errors combine to cause a shallow bomb to fall short of the target. A bomb
delivered from too steep a dive falls long.

G Loading

The instantaneous effect of increased G is to increase the AOA and reduce the
effective depression from flight path resulting in a short bomb. If increased G
is held for any length of time, a dive angle error results, compounding the
problem. If the instantaneous G is reduced (bunt) the effect is opposite and
the bomb goes long.

Bank Angle Error

Since the sight is depressed below the flight path, it acts like a long
pendulum. Rotating this pendulum results in two errors. First, the sight
rotates away from the bank angle; second, the reticle moves forward in range.
As a result, if a bomb is dropped in a bank, the bomb falls short and in the
direction of the bank from where the pipper is pointed.

Uncoordinated Flight
Since a bomb travels along the flight path at release, if the sight line is not

along the flight path, an impact error results. The bomb impacts laterally in
the direction of any skid.

Corrections

Release Aim Point
If you find you did not have the proper aim point, recompute it as necessary

and move it. If the problem was in tracking the aim point, resolve to track
more accurately on the next pass.

Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_55.jpeg:
Base Leg Adjustments

If you had an error in parameters, the most likely problem is that the base
leg was not properly flown. Improper base leg position can result in dive
angle errors and altitude errors. Roll-in technique is most often responsible
for airspeed problems, but roll-in problems are normally the result of trying
to correct for base leg positioning errors. The bottom line for parameter
errors is to make the necessary corrections to your base leg on the next pass.

Crew Coordination
Pilot

The pilot’s primary job is to fly the aircraft, avoid the ground, and fly to the
proper release point. Additionally, the pilot selects delivery options.

WSO

The WSO is the primary sensor operator. During manual deliveries there is
little or no sensor operation to be performed so the WSO can help the pilot by
calling airspeed, dive angle, and altitudes. Defensive lookout is required
during any delivery. In addition, the WSO should monitor the attack and
provide checklist support to the pilot.

Error Analysis

Between passes, the crew should analyze the previous pass to determine
what corrections, if any, should be made on the next pass. Downwind is the
best place to do this because this is where you have the most time, and most
adjustments have to be made on the base leg.

Assumptions

Basic error analysis assumes the pipper was on the target and only one error
exists. Because of these assumptions you need to separate aiming errors
from parameter errors. If you did not have the pipper on the “proper” target,
fix it on the next pass. If you did have the pipper on the “proper” target/aim
point and the bomb still missed, then you must have made an error in
parameters. If you do not know where the pipper was and where the bomb
hit relative to the pipper, you have no basis to make a correction.

D - 49 AGD-3


Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_56.jpeg:
CONCLUSION

That is about it for manual deliveries. You will not get to do them often, but
many of the principles involved in manual bombing will also affect the
accuracy of computed deliveries. The more aspects of the bombing problem
you solve by flying consistent and accurate passes, the better your computed
deliveries will be.

Knowing the correct aim-off point is critical even for computed deliveries. If
you do not know it and pick a distance too close to the target, you have an
excellent chance to frag yourself or even contact the ground during your
recovery.

HANDOUT

The following are examples of CWDS products for a MK 84 LD release at
30° of dive, 500 KTAS, and 4910 MSL releases.

NOTES:

Fuze data (page G-2): the maximum fuze arm time is worst case and
includes a 20% tolerance for the M905 tail fuze which is greater than the
10% for a M904E2.

Release conditions (page G-2): the 4910 MSL minimum release altitude in
this example is based on maximum fuze arm time to prevent a dud. Note
TOF is also 7.2 seconds. You would want to change the release altitude to
a round number (as an example, 5000 MSL) and recompute the solution.
In this example, a 90-foot change is only about 2 mils.

Safe escape (page G-3): There are only 2 safe escape tables for 0 and 5000
foot target density altitudes. Use the closest one. Safe escape is not a
problem with 6 second arm time. The profile output example shows the
altitude lost of 13867 feet for a 1000 foot TDA and recovers you at 3543
MSL. Further down the page (weapon MRA information) you see the
minimum release altitude for safe escape is only 3512 MSL, 3583 to
accommodate altimeter lag.

CAUTION: CWDS will not advise you if safe separation is not met for
mechanical fuzes. You need to compare the safe escape table TOF (4.86
seconds) (page G-5) to your fuze arm time minus fuze tolerance

(6 - 1.2 = 4.8). The tolerance can be determined by subtracting the
maximum fuze arm time from the fuze setting (7.2 - 6 = 1.2 seconds) in the
fuze setting section on page G-2. In this example you would need to retry
the problem using an 8 second fuze setting to exceed the 4.86 seconds
needed (8 - 1.6 = 6.4 minimum arm time) which again changes all your
data of release altitude, mil settings, etc.

Ballistic table (page G-7): Note the TOF from 4000 AGL (7.34 seconds)
exceeds our maximum fuze arming of 7.2 (page G-2) and the table is clear
if arming time exceeds TOF based on fuze setting inputs.

Error analysis (page G-8): Note that short errors tend to exceed long
errors of the same amount.

BOMBING TERMS AND RELATIONSHIPS

There is much more to the bombing problem than just pointing the aircraft at
the target and releasing the bomb. To establish the picture, it helps to know
and understand the terms and relationships which exist in the basic bombing
problem. Even if you never perform a manual delivery, this background in
the bombing problem should help you improve your preflight planning and
your range scores.

Time of Fall

The time of fall (TOF) of a bomb is simply the time from release to impact.
TOF is determined by aircraft altitude, dive angle, and airspeed at bomb
release; ejection velocity; gravity; and bomb drag. This time is most
important to you when determining fuze arm times and minimum release
altitudes. The TOF value for a given set of delivery parameters is found in
ballistic tables and is given in seconds. Though difficult to compute, this time
is the basis for the rest of the ballistic computations. For a level delivery of a
dragless bomb, TOF can be calculated by the formula:

2h
g

t=

where
t = TOF
h = distance of fall
g = gravity (32.2 ft/sec’)

Bomb Range

Bomb range (Figure D-1) is simply the horizontal distance a bomb travels
during its time of fall. Without drag, range is equal to the horizontal
component of true airspeed at release multiplied by the bomb time of fall.
The bomb range for a given set of delivery parameters can be found in
ballistic tables and is given in feet. The bombing problem is determining
when your range to the target is equal to the current bomb range. Any
variation in release velocity, dive angle, or altitude affects bomb range and
delivery accuracy.

AGD-3 D-2


Text from AGD-3_Basic_Bombing_page_9.jpeg:
Bomb Trail

Bomb trail (Figure D-1) reflects the drag effect in bomb range. Because a
bomb has drag, it begins to lose forward speed as soon as it is released and
begins to lag behind the aircraft. The distance a bomb lags behind the
delivery aircraft is called bomb trail. This value is not directly computed nor
is it given in Dash 34 tables. The higher the drag and the longer the TOF of
a bomb, the larger its bomb trail.

To calculate bomb trail, subtract bomb range from average aircraft velocity
(in ft/sec) times bomb TOF.

bomb trail = (aircraft velocity x bomb TOF) — (bomb range)

Ballistic Trajectory

Ballistic trajectory is the path of a munition from release to impact. This
trajectory is the result of release velocity, release angle, release height above
the target, gravity, and weapon drag characteristics.

Mil (Milliradian)

Mil is a term commonly used as an abbreviation for milliradian (1/1000 of a
radian). A radian is a unit of plane angular measurement equal to the angle
at the center of a circle subtended by an arc equal in length to the radius of
the circle. Since the circumference of a circle is equal to 27 times the radius,
there are 27, or 6.283, radians (6283 milliradians) in a complete circle. Since
a circle with a radius of 1000 feet has a circumference of 6283 feet

(c = 2x x 1000 = 6283), each milliradian subtends one foot at a range of

1000 feet. The relationship of milliradians to degrees is:

1 mil = et 0.0573°
6283

17.453 mils = 1°

AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_10.jpeg:
It is recommended that the EGI be used as the primary PPKS. The EGI
position, velocity, and altitude outputs are taken into the position/velocity
consistency (PVC) filter in the CC. The PVC filter provides stable and
consistent data which is used for navigation, steering, and weapon
delivery. The FNU INS will continue to provide the primary attitude,
heading, attitude rate, and accelerations to the CC.

NOTE: The remaining text refers to aircraft before EGI unless
noted at that paragraph.

Coordinate Transformations

In processing information for the various avionics systems, several
reference/coordinate systems are used (e.g., earth coordinates, aircraft
coordinates). For the various systems to talk back and forth, any spatial
point of interest must be known relative to each of the frames of reference.
This function is accomplished by the MN.

Symbol Placement/Steering

When INS is the selected PP source, the MN PP is used only to place A/G
radar and TGT IR display symbology during A/G radar or TGT IR position
updates and A/G weapon(s) release steering/cues. When MN is the
selected PP source, MN PP is used to position all navigation symbology on
the HUD, TSD, A/A and A/G radar, TGT IR, TEWS/EADI/EHSI, and for
UFC navigation information.

Sensor Pointing

As in the case of symbol placement, the CC uses the present position of
the PP keeping source to point sensors (A/G radar, TGT IR) at specific
points of interest. Once a target is designated, all weapon(s) release
symbology is based on MN present position, regardless of the PP keeping
source.

AGD-4 D-4


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_11.jpeg:
Target Designation

Target designation is nothing more than identifying to the A/G module
[weapon(s) release program] that a particular CC-stored sequence point
(usually a target) has been chosen to receive your load of iron. The MN
gets the job because it is the most accurate short-term navigator if it is
properly updated (position and velocities). Although a stored target or
target offset is normally used for the target designation, the system is
capable of bombing other sequence points (steer points, aim points, base,
mark points) or locations not stored in the CC (targets of opportunity).

Requirement for Designation

Normally, there are many sequence points stored in the CC (base, steer
points, aim points, targets, target offsets, mark points, bullseye points,
avoidance points). Although the system allows us to bomb targets of
opportunity, we normally identify (with target syntax) those points on
which we anticipate the need to employ air-to-ground ordnance.
Additionally, at any given time, the A/G radar cursor, TGT IR cursor,
HUD reticle, and current aircraft sequence point may all be different
geographic locations. In order to employ our computed weapons delivery
modes [AUTO and continuously displayed impact point (CDIP)] we must
identify to the CC our intent to release weapons and where we want those
weapons to impact. This process is referred to as target designation. Only
after target designation do we obtain weapons delivery information
(versus simply navigation information) on the HUD and the ability to
release weapons via the AUTO or CDIP weapons delivery modes.

Once a designation has occurred, it is presented on various cockpit
displays. This can be an aid to visually identify the target. With most
designation methods the target pod is pointed to the target location to
further refine the designation.

The act of designation always occurs before the bombs are released for

computed deliveries. For CDIP this may be a very short period of time,
but can be a long time (minutes) for some auto deliveries.

Definitions

Designation Triangle

In order to put bombs on the target with the F-15E, the first task is to
have the most accurate designation possible. Once a designation is
obtained, the system (MN) will use the information it has to figure all
parts of the designation triangle (Figure D-2). It is important to note that
it can be a single shot computation or can be updated frequently during
the bombing run.

The three sides of the triangle are known as height above target (HAT),
slant range (SR) to the target, and ground range (GR) to the target. The
angle between the aircraft INS horizon and the line of sight of the sensor
to the designation is referred to as the graze angle. With any two of these
four values known, the computer is able to calculate the remaining values.
Of particular interest are the HAT and ground range which are used for
weapons ballistics computations.

Definitions (Altitudes/Elevations)

There are several altitude/elevation terms that we must understand
during any discussion of target designations (and air-to-ground weapons
delivery). The definitions are important because they represent separate
means of altitude information needed by the MN to determine where to
place the target vertically (Z coordinate) when we designate and to
determine our aircraft’s location-to-target vertical relationship during
sensor cueing and computed weapons deliveries.

Target Elevation (Ht)

Ht is entered by the aircrew during route construction through the DTM
or manually on the UFC point data submenu. List points can transfer Ht.
Alternately, Ht is calculated by the navigation module during the
designation process.

Steer Point Elevation (Hsp)

Hsp is a stored sequence point altitude as entered by the aircrew during
route construction (DTM, list point transfer, or manually through the
UFC). Hsp and Ht can be synonymous, but are not necessarily so.

System Altitude (Hsys)

System altitude is ADC corrected pressure altitude smoothed by the CC
using INS vertical velocities. It is not necessarily the same as MSL
altitude as read on the HUD and ADI. System altitude is always
measured/calculated by the NAV module and cannot be entered directly
by the aircrew. The aircrew resets the system altitude during preflight
ground operations so that the system altitude is the same as the elevation
(MSL) of the ground under the aircraft. The aircrew then updates the
system altitude using overfly freeze position updates, overfly freeze
altitude updates over a known point or flat surface, and TGT IR updates
(position and altitude, or altitude only). HUD or A/G radar updates do not
update system altitude.

D-7 AGD-4


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_14.jpeg:
It is extremely important to ensure accurate system altitude as it is the
primary altitude/elevation source for some types of designations and is
always a default/backup altitude/elevation source for all methods of
designation and all computed weapons deliveries. One point to remember
is that a CC reset (CC reset button or CC ground power switch) rejects
your system altitude update, and a subsequent system altitude update
before designating targets and dropping bombs is highly advised.

Height Above Target (HAT)

HAT is the true altitude of the aircraft above the target. It is one of the
pieces of information used by the mission NAV to provide steering to the
designated target. It is also a critical bit of information used by the A/G
module (ballistics computer) to figure the computed release range of the
weapons selected.

Height Above Ground (HAG)

HAG is also a true altitude above the ground, always computed in the
central computer and used for updates in the course of the flight. This is
also used by the ballistics computer if an undesignated CDIP delivery is
attempted.

Designation Sources Versus Ranging/Altitude Sources

There are a variety of methods to designate targets. Each of these
methods has a variety of possible sources of determining where the target
is, in range/elevation relative to the aircraft, and when the
aircraft-to-target relationship matches the computed ballistics of the
selected weapons. The designation methods include NAV, A/G radar, TGT
IR and several visual methods utilizing the A/G HUD symbology. Possible
methods of determining range to target and/or our aircraft’s height above
target (HAT) include laser ranging (LAS) through the TGT IR pod, high
resolution map (HRM) ranging, air-to-ground radar ranging (AGR),
passive ranging from TGT IR pod pointing angles (PASS), radar altitude
(RALT), and aircraft system altitude (SYS). Not all designation methods
are created equal—some are more accurate than others. Neither are all
ranging/altitude sources created equal.

AGD-4 D-8


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_15.jpeg:
SYS (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

SYS is the means of using Hsys to compute target elevation and aircraft
height above target (HAT) for target designations and weapons delivery.
This method can be the primary means for computing HAT, and is always
a backup means. It is compatible with all designation methods.

SYS (After TCTO 1F-15E-737)

SYSG: With EGI as the PPKS, the system altitude (SYSG) is the EGI
blended altitude combined with the blended vertical velocity by the
position/velocity consistency filter in the CC.

SYSB: For other PPKS selections, the system altitude (SYSB) is
temperature corrected pressure altitude.

Radar Altitude (RALT)

RALT is the means of computing target elevation for target designations
and/or HAT using inputs from the radar altimeter. It is only used if
included in the manual hierarchy as programmed by the aircrew and only
if the manual (versus auto) hierarchy is selected by the aircrew. RALT is
only used if the aircraft attitude is less than 60° of bank and pitch. RALT
is compatible with all designation methods, but is usually programmed as
a backup, versus primary, source. When RALT is used, HAT is computed
as HAT = RALT. Obviously, RALT would not be a good source of HAT if
the approach to the target/computed weapon(s) release point was over
changing terrain elevation or terrain elevation differed from the target
elevation. RALT will not be used for a NAV or A/G radar designation for
computing target elevation. However, it can be used for computing HAT
once the aircraft reaches 15 seconds to weapon(s) release (15 TREL) ona

Air-to-Ground Ranging (AGR)

AGR is the method of computing target elevation during target
designations and HAT for weapons delivery using A/G radar slant range.
AGR is available for use if the aircrew selects the auto sensor hierarchy
(LAS, AGR, SYS—in that order of precedence), and is available if
programmed into the manual hierarchy. AGR is compatible with all
designation methods and can be slaved to the target designation (HUD TD
diamond), to the TGT IR pod LOS, to the AUTO delivery mode pipper or
to the CDIP delivery mode pipper.

Even if included in the selected hierarchy (AUTO/MAN), AGR inputs will
not be used if the radar antenna elevation is not depressed at least -1.25°.
The system does not want to use unreliable information from shallower
radar graze angles.

AGR is commanded automatically when the CC determines that a slant
range measurement is required. During any designated AUTO weapons
delivery a slant range measurement is required for the last 15 seconds
prior to computed weapon(s) release. Just like RALT, AGR will not be
used to determine target elevation during a NAV or radar designation but
it can be used to determine HAT once 15 TREL is reached.

The CC commands the radar to AGR at the target pod LOS, providing
ranging for TGT IR designations and weapons deliveries:

e@ when the target pod cursor function TGT (or UPDT) is selected,
e AGR is included in the selected hierarchy,
e the aircrew is in command of the TGT IR, and

e laser range is not available, not valid, or above LAS in the manual
hierarchy.

The AGR value can then be used for computing target elevation for
designations and HAT for weapons delivery calculations.

When the pilot takes command of the HUD and the target pod laser is not
firing, the CC commands the radar to provide AGR to the HUD. In AUTO
bombing mode AGR is provided to the designated target or to the AUTO
pipper if there is no designated target. In CDIP bombing mode, AGR is
always to the CDIP pipper (with or without a target designation).

AGD-4 D-10


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_17.jpeg:
In summary, AGR slant range can be used to compute HAT following a
NAV or A/G radar target designation and can be used for target
designation/HAT computations for TGT IR and AUTO/CDIP pipper
designations.

Since some sensors could provide unreliable data for use in slant
range/HAT data, the CC performs sanity and/or validity checks to
determine whether the sensor-provided information should be used.
Before AGR is used, the following conditions must be satisfied to assess
the AGR as valid.

e AGR grazing angle must be kept at or greater than 1.25°.

e The designated target during designated AUTO weapons deliveries
must be within the radar antenna gimbal limits.

e The computed range from AGR must be within -10,000/+15,000 feet
of the designated target position as calculated by the CC (MN) during
designated AUTO weapons deliveries from a NAV or A/G radar
designation.

LASER Ranging (LAS)

LAS is the means of using LASER slant range for computing target
range/elevation and/or HAT for target designations and computed
weapons deliveries using the TGT IR laser. LAS can be used for TGT IR
and HUD designations, and for weapons delivery computations from these
designations. It is the first priority sensor if AUTO sensor hierarchy is
selected on the A/G delivery display and can be included, at aircrew
discretion, in MAN sensor hierarchy, programmed using the A/G delivery
display.

Laser sensor validity checks are applied for HUD designations only. The
sensor fails the check if the target pod is not actively slaved to the:

e designated target (for designated AUTO weapons deliveries).
e AUTO pipper for undesignated AUTO weapons deliveries.

e CDIP pipper for all CDIP (designated or undesignated) weapons
deliveries.

D-11 AGD-4


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_18.jpeg:
If the auto sensor hierarchy is selected or if the manual sensor hierarchy
is selected and includes LAS, when the pilot takes command of the HUD a
second time, the TGT IR LOS (and hence the laser) is slaved to the HUD.
It is slaved to the TD diamond (if a target is designated) or to the
AUTO/CDIP pipper if there is no target designation (undesignated
AUTO/CDIP).

PASS (Passive Ranging)

Target elevation and HAT are computed using TGT IR pod pointing
angles and line of sight rates (trigonometric calculations) without using
any of the other altitude or ranging sources. It is compatible only with
TGT IR designations.

HRM

HAT is computed using TGT IR pod pointing angles and ranging from a
HRM patch map. It is utilized only for TGT IR pod designations, which
follow an A/G radar patch map designation.

Designation Methods

There are six methods which can be used to designate a target. They are
NAV, radar, TGT IR, AUTO pipper, CDIP pipper, and zero point. The
flow on a typical mission would be to plan for each type as you get closer
to the target. There is a time/distance relationship with the target for
each. A NAV designation can be done at any distance. The radar
designation will be done inside radar range, typically less than 30 nm. A
target pod designation would typically be planned at 8-5 nm from the
target. The pipper designation inside visual range to target, 4-1 nm. In
this context a zero point could be used as a reattack option. In general
terms the accuracy of the designation will also improve as you move down
the list, with the exception of zero point which is mechanically the same as
a NAV designation. Another important relationship that exists is the fact
that each of the first five will “overwrite” any of the previous designations
on the list. For example, a TGT IR will overwrite a NAV or radar, but not
an AUTO or CDIP pipper designation. A description of each method is
presented later in the text.

Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_19.jpeg:
Range/Altitude Source Hierarchy

Hierarchies of the range/altitude sources to be used may be programmed/
selected by the aircrew utilizing the A/G delivery (A/G DLVRY)
MPD/MPCD display format (more later in this text on mechanics). The
aircrew may choose to use either the auto hierarchy or manual hierarchy.
The auto selection allows only LAS, AGR and SYS to be used, in that
order of precedence. The manual selection allows the aircrew to build the
hierarchy with only one or as many as all six range/altitude sources
included. One constraint is that SYS must always be included.
Remember, regardless of the sensor hierarchy selected (AUTO or MAN)
the range/altitude sources will only be used if they are compatible with
the current designation method.

Finally, not all ranging/altitude sources are available/compatible with all
designation sources/methods. Figure D-3 shows which range/altitude
sources are compatible with each designation method.

Figure D - 4. A/G DLVRY Display.

The selections input by the aircrew on the A/G ARMT (PACS) display are
visually repeated on the A/G DLVRY display format. Generally, the
selections can be programmed through the DTM or input manually. Most
of the inputs are tied to a specific A/G PACS weapons delivery program
(PROG 1-4). By changing the PACS PROG, the aircrew also selects the
A/G DLVRY parameters tied to that program. The following discusses
A/G DLVRY display options.

e RET XXX, PB #2: Provides entry (through the UFC scratchpad) of a
reticle depression angle (mils) for use in noncomputed (direct or
manual) bombing. The manual or direct HUD reticle will be
depressed from the aircraft flight path by the value set (0 through
250 mils).

AGD-4 D-14


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_21.jpeg:
e Minimum Recovery Altitude (MRA), PB #3: Values of 0 through
50,000, in one foot intervals, can be set using a UFC scratchpad
entry. The entry will provide HUD cues that can be used to
deconflict from the weapons effects (fragmentation envelope) of
ownship or other aircraft A/G weapons.

e PROG (1-4), PB #5: Pressing the button will cycle through the four
PACS weapons delivery programs.

The PACS program parameters (delivery mode, release sequencing,
fuzing) and the PACS selections for A/A CBT or TNG and A/G CBT or
TNG are reflected at the bottom of the display. (These selections can only
be made from a PACS display.) The current aircraft master mode
selection is boxed. Current aircraft system altitude, current winds and
current CC clock time are also displayed. The |RDY | mimics the status
on the A/G PACS display.

Across the top of the display are the loaded store legends and quantities.
The store legends are boxed only if they are selected on the A/G PACS
display (selection/deselection can only be accomplished from A/G PACS
display).

The data below the stations (LOFT, TARM, MLAS, AT, CT, etc.) mimic
values programmed on a separate A/G delivery program (A/G DLVRY
PROG) display, which is addressed later in this workbook.

The programmed/selected sensor hierarchy (AUTO or MAN)/status is
depicted in the center of the display. The sensor currently being used for
HAT calculations is boxed. The selection of the auto or manual sensor
hierarchy is made at PB #18. The manual hierarchy can only be
programmed/changed on a separate A/G DLVRY PROG display format.

Toggling PB #1 alternately selects the two formats (A/G DLVRY and A/G
DLVRY PROG). The PB #1 legend (PROG PAGE) is boxed when the
PROG DISPLAY is the currently viewed format.

The A/G DLVRY PROG display is mechanized as follows.

e Data displayed adjacent to PB #2 (LOFT XX), PB #3 (AT), PB #4
(CT), PB #6 (TARM XX.X), PB #7 (DGR), and PB #8 (MLAS) are
associated with the weapon program at PB #5 and its associated
weapon as programmed on the A/G PACS. Ifa weapon is not selected
(boxed) on the A/G PACS display for the particular program, then the
legends are blank. If any legend parameters are not available for the
selected weapon, the appropriate PB legend is blank. After
programming, the option values are mimicked on both the A/G PACS
display and the A/G DLVRY display (for that program) (PROG 1-4).

AGD-4 D-16


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_23.jpeg:
Loft Angle, PB #2: With a blank UFC scratchpad, pressing PB #2
toggles between LOFT XX and LOFT MAX. With LOFT XX selected,
a value (0-45) can be entered through the UFC scratchpad. The CC
computes a maximum range loft weapon(s) release or a loft weapon(s)
release using the loft angle selected. HUD cues include a time to pull
(TPULL XX) and an elevation steering bar to enable the aircrew to
execute the desired loft weapons delivery profile. The HUD cues are
only available if LOFT MAX or an angle greater than 5° is
programmed.

Along Track (AT) Bias (PB #8) and/or Cross Track (CT) Bias (PB #4):
The aircrew can adjust the impact point for ballistic weapons. Values
for each PACS PROG can be entered via a UFC scratchpad entry at
PB #3/PB #4. Toggling PB #3/PB #4 allows biases to be entered
(utilizing the UFC scratchpad) in mils or in feet. A negative [UFC
shift (-)] value moves the computed weapons impact short or left. No
sign signifies a long or right bias to the CC-computed impact point.
Values that can be entered are -9999 to +9999 feet or -50 to +50 mils.

Cycling PB #5 selects the PACS weapons delivery program that the
aircrew influences with the A/G DLVRY PROG inputs.

TARM, PB #6: A UFC scratchpad entry (0 through 99.9) enters a
weapon time to arm after release from the aircraft. If a decimal is
not manually entered, it is automatically entered before the right
most displayed entry. The aircrew entry should agree with the time
fuze set on the weapon, itself. The entry enables HUD cues (“DUD”)
which signify that under current conditions, the weapon(s), if
released, will have insufficient arming time and will impact
unarmed.

Desired Ground Range (DGR), PB #7: As with the other pushbutton
legends, this one is only displayed when applicable for the weapon
type associated with the PB #5 selected PROG (from the PACS A/G
display). DGR is only available for GBU-24 or GBU-28 employment.
Allowable values are 0 through 99,999 feet. GBU-24/-28 and DGR
are beyond the scope of our discussion.

D-17 AGD-4


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_24.jpeg:
e Auto Lase (ALAS)/Manual Lase (MLAS), PB #8: Toggling the button
alternates between ALAS X:XX (or ALAS CONT) and MLAS X:XX (or
MLAS CONT). UFC scratchpad entries of time or C (for continuous)
influence the displayed values. Time values allowed depend on the
type of weapon selected for the PACS PROG (GBU-10/-12/-24/-28).
This feature can also be used for SUU-20 employment (simulating
GBU employment). For SUU-20, valid entries are from one second
(0:01) to one minute, thirty seconds (1:30). If a colon is entered, two
digits must be entered after the colon or the display will not accept
the UFC scratchpad entry.

e SYS, RALT, PASS, AGR, HRM, LAS, PBs #15 through #20: These
buttons allow the aircrew to build a hierarchy of aircraft sensors to be
used in providing/computing slant range (SLR), height above target
(HAT), or height above ground (HAG) which will be utilized during
arriving at a weapon(s) release solution. Pressing PBs #15 through
#20 allows assignment of a hierarchy sequence number. If a
sequence number is already displayed, pressing the button removes
the number. The smallest unused sequence number is assigned to
the applicable sensor.

e CLEAR (PB #14): Pressing PB #14 removes all sequence numbers
adjacent to the sensor legends at PBs #15 through #20.

e AUTO/MAN, PB #13: Pressing PB #13 toggles between MAN and
AUTO sensor hierarchy. This determines the hierarchy that is
displayed in the center of the A/G PROG display format, either
AUTO or MAN. The sequence displayed will be utilized for target
designation and weapons delivery, given that the sensor information
is available (and in some cases valid) and compatible with the
designation method.

e ENTER, PB #10: Pressing PB #10 enters the sensors selected at
PBs #15 through #20 into the manual sensor hierarchy. If MAN is
selected at PB #18, the center of the display reflects the entered
hierarchy. If a sensor is not assigned a sequence number, it does not
appear in the display hierarchy. With AUTO selected, only LAS,
AGR or SYS are displayed in the hierarchy.

AGD-4 D-18


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_25.jpeg:
The sensor hierarchy selection (MAN or AUTO) that will actually be used
during weapons delivery is that selected on the A/G DLVRY (not the A/G
DLVRY PROG) display.

The center of the display (both the A/G DLVRY display and the

A/G DLVRY PROG display) also shows sensor status as VAL (valid), SAN
(valid, but not passing sanity checks), or OFF (not passing validity or
sanity checks). TO 1F-15E-34-1-1 provides explanations of validity and
sanity.

A/G HUD

The following discussion does not include all possible HUD symbology.
The HUD depictions are simplified to show only the symbology that is
germane to this lesson. A full description of AUTO/CDIP HUD weapons
employment symbology will follow in the Computed Bombing Modes
workbook and lecture.

NAV/INST Master Mode

In the NAV/INST master mode (Figure D-6), the HUD depicts steering
(wind-corrected) to the current aircraft sequence point (NAV 4.A) utilizing
a bank steering bar and a command heading bug. The data block depicts
the current aircraft sequence point (4.A), the slant range (N5.0) and the
ETE or ETA to the sequence point. If the sequence point is within the
HUD FOV, it is depicted as a LOS circle. All the above assumes NAV
steering is selected on the HSI.

The NAV/INST master mode HUD remains essentially the same,

regardless of the PACS status and/or whether or not a target is
designated. (The gun cross is visible if the master arm is in ARM).

vector for AUTO; pipper suspended from the velocity vector by a displayed
impact line (DIL) in CDIP]. Along with a PACS RDY light, the
AUTO/CDIP legend in the HUD data block is a visible indication that the
PACS is RDY. The best cues to determine that a target designation has
occurred are the “TGT” versus “NAV” in the data block, the ASL (in AUTO
PACS mode) and the TD diamond (versus LOS circle) if the designated
target is within the HUD FOV.

DESIGNATION DESCRIPTIONS

This section examines the six methods of target designation (NAV, A/G
radar, TGT IR, AUTO pipper, CDIP pipper and zero point). Some of the
methods are very similar to others, some require visual flight conditions,
some are easier to accomplish than others, and some methods provide
better accuracy than others. The following section describes how each
method works, how to designate using each of the methods, and the
pitfalls associated with each.

NAV Designation

This designation method is not dependent on data outside the CC. It is
virtually automatic and provides a means of designating a target with
little crew effort. It provides no better accuracy than the MN NAV
steering; however it identifies to the CC that weapons delivery on the
target sequence point is intended, and provides HUD steering cues (and
weapons delivery information cues) to a weapon(s) release point rather
than to the target sequence point, itself.

Description

The NAV module recognizes crew-entered sequence point data (lat/long,
elev) as belonging to a target by its syntax (xx.). With the A/G master
mode selected, when the system sequences (automatically or manually) to
a target sequence point, the NAV module retrieves the stored target data
and the MN present position. With the two sets of coordinates, the NAV
module is able to calculate the location of the target (X, Y, Z coordinates).

Normally, the target elevation is entered and stored along with the
coordinates. The NAV module sets target elevation (Ht) equal to the
stored elevation. If the target elevation (Ht) is not stored, the NAV
module sets the target altitude equal to zero (sea level). The NAV module
then converts the retrieved latitude, longitude, and target elevation to a
geocentric position. The module determines HAT by subtracting target
elevation from system altitude (Hsys). The NAV designation uses this
HAT determination routine regardless of the sensor priority selected on
the A/G delivery display.

Once made, this designation is retained until undesignated or replaced by

another designation. Any of the other designation methods can be used
for a subsequent designation as they all overwrite a NAV designation.

D-27 AGD-4


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_34.jpeg:
With the target designated and coordinate transformations complete, the
CC commands the TGT IR to the A/G mode and wide field of view, and
directs the pod head to the target line of sight (laterally and vertically).
The cue point is saved (in that, if the target pod is slewed it can, via
HOTAS, be returned to the previously cued position) and the target
sequence point syntax is displayed at PB #17 of the TGT IR display in
preparation for a possible TGT IR redesignation.

Procedures

The bulk of this procedure, and certainly the most critical part, takes
place during mission planning.

Obtain Coordinates: Since the coordinates become the target, right or
wrong, use the most accurate source possible. Do not pick them off of a
JNC chart. In addition to the lat/long, it is very important to use the
correct target elevation.

If coordinates are obtained from a map, they can be no more accurate than
the basic accuracy of the map. If the target coordinates are chosen off a
1:250,000 JOG, the best expected accuracy is 500 feet horizontally and
100 feet vertically.

Assign / Enter Coordinates: Assign the data to a target syntax sequence
point (xx.) utilizing AFMSS/DTM or manual procedures.

Select Target: As the route is flown, either allow the system to
auto-sequence, or enter the target point directly into the UFC as the
current aircraft sequence point. The designation occurs when both the
target sequence point becomes the current point and A/G MM is selected.
(These two requirements can occur in either order.)

No Other Designation: The NAV module only makes the designation with
no current designation. This method cannot overwrite an existing
designation.

MN performance has a significant effect on the accuracy of this method. If
the MN present position is in error, the calculated relative position of the
target is also in error. This results in sensor pointing errors, attack
steering errors, and weapon(s) release errors.

AGD-4 D - 28


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_35.jpeg:
Although it is the MN which calculates the location of the target and
provides weapon(s) release steering, INS performance is important to
overall system accuracy. Its primary effect, as far as designation is
concerned, is on MN performance. It is important to MN accuracy because
the MN receives essential information from the INS.

HAT Update

The engineers who designed the designation methods realized that a HAT
measurement taken at a great distance/time from the target may not be
very accurate. Therefore, an automatic update to the HAT portion of the
designation triangle is attempted at 15 TREL. RALT and AGR are the
only choices for this update.

RALT

Although only SYS is used to establish the aircraft-to-target relationship
at the time of the NAV designation, RALT can be used to update the
aircraft-to-target relationship, but only after the aircraft has reached 15
seconds to weapon(s) release (15 TREL). RALT must be valid (aircraft
within radar altimeter pitch and bank limits). Additionally, the manual
hierarchy must be selected on the A/G DLVRY display and RALT must be
higher than SYS (and AGR) in the hierarchy. With all the above satisfied,
the aircrew may see the target designator (TD) diamond symbol on the
HUD shift in elevation as the system transitions from SYS to RALT. The
NAV data block on the HUD will also change from SYS to RALT as the
transition occurs. It is important to note that the position of the target
(coordinates/elevation) has not changed. Only the “aircraft CC
understanding” of the aircraft-to-target relationship has changed.

AGR

The CC automatically commands the radar to provide a slant range
measurement [aircraft to target designation (the TD diamond)] when the
CC determines a slant range measurement is required. For a NAV
designation the CC forces the radar to the AGR mode at 15 TREL (AUTO
delivery PACS mode), but only if the radar is not supporting an in-flight
MRM.

D - 29 AGD-4


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_36.jpeg:
Even after the CC has commanded AGR and AGR has been achieved,
AGR will not be used unless:

e The radar elevation angle (graze angle) is at least -1.25°.

e Kither the AUTO sensor hierarchy is selected on the A/G DLVRY
display or the MANUAL sensor hierarchy is selected with AGR above
SYS and RALT (assuming RALT is valid) in the hierarchy.

e The computed range from AGR must be within -10,000/+15,000 feet
of the existing designation (in this case, the original NAV
designation).

e The target designation is within the radar gimbal limits.

Once valid AGR is achieved, a range analog bar appears at the reticle
displaying slant range (pegged at 23,000 feet until slant range reaches
23,000 feet) and digital slant range appears above the sequence point line
in the HUD data block. “RNG” appears in the A/G radar display BIT
window and a digital range readout appears centered at the top of the A/G
radar display.

If AGR is being used by the system to compute HAT (it is the highest
usable member of the selected sensor hierarchy on the A/G DLVRY
display), then “AGR” appears in the bottom right of the HUD NAV data
block following the delivery mode (i.e., AUTO AGR) and AGR is boxed on
the A/G DLVRY display.

Once inside 15 seconds TREL, when the radar goes to AGR, neither crew
member can take command of the radar (A/A or A/G) until the target is
undesignated (more later on how to undesignate) or the designated target
location exceeds radar gimbal limits.

If the radar is supporting an in-flight MRM, another attempt to go to AGR
is made at 10 TREL. When MRM support is no longer required, the radar
will enter AGR if and when all the other prerequisites for AGR are valid.
If AGR becomes invalid, the CC will default to the next appropriate
member of the HAT sensor hierarchy as selected on the A/G DLVRY
display.

Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_37.jpeg:
Crew Errors

Choosing erroneous coordinates/elevation is the most basic crew error
concerning the NAV designation. Another basic crew error could involve
data entry. If the target data is entered incorrectly, an erroneous
designation occurs. The NAV module designates the stored
coordinates/elevation as the target, whatever those coordinates/
elevation are.

A not quite so obvious error is mismanagement of INS/MN updates. Make
sure the present position and velocities of the INS and MN are as accurate
as possible, and guard against putting an error into either system. Do not
update position unless the coordinates of the update point are certain and
more accurate than the existing error. You can feel confident about a
PVU of the MN, and should consider accomplishing one within five
minutes of bomb release, and before designations. Remember, for five
minutes following a MN PVU, the MN uses INS velocity corrected by the
error measured by the PVU. After this five minute period the corrections
are removed and potential velocity errors in the mission NAV can cause
bad bomb scores.

A/G Radar Designation

Description

When the crew member in command of the air-to-ground radar commands
target designation, the CC sends a mark command to the radar. The
radar marks the cursor position and returns a time tagged Rx and Ry to
the CC which identifies the target designation position relative to the
aircraft MN present position.

D-31 AGD-4


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_38.jpeg:
The next step is to determine the elevation of the marked target and
aircraft height above the target (HAT). If a sequence point is displayed at
the A/G radar (PB #17), the NAV module retrieves the sequence point
data and sets the ground point elevation equal to sequence point
elevation. If the sequence point displayed at PB #17 is a target offset
point, the NAV module retrieves the associated target point data and
computes target position by applying the target offset-to-target
relationship to the cursor position (and uses the target elevation, vice the
offset elevation). If the PB #17 sequence point’s elevation is unknown or if
“SP” is displayed at PB #17, the NAV module uses the current aircraft
sequence point stored elevation. If the current aircraft sequence point
elevation is unknown, ground point elevation is set equal to sea level.
This altitude determination routine is used regardless of the priority
sensor selected on the A/G delivery display.

With target relative position and target elevation now known, the NAV
module calculates earth coordinates and designates the target at lat/long
and Ht. This designation is retained until undesignated or replaced by
another designation. An A/G radar designation can be overwritten by any
subsequent type of designation except NAV, including another A/G radar
designation. Following the designation, the NAV module completes all of
the required coordinate transformations and sends them to the data base
for use by avionic systems as required.

With the target designated, the CC commands the TGT IR to the A/G
mode and wide field of view, and directs the target pod to the target line of
sight (azimuth and elevation). The cue point is saved (again, for a return
to cue, via HOTAS, if the target pod is slewed off the cued position).

When a target designation or cue occurs on the A/G radar format (TGT or
CUE cursor function selected) with a sequence point number adjacent to
PB #17, the sequence point number will also be displayed on the TGT IR
format adjacent to PB #17. When a target offset number is displayed
adjacent to PB #17 on the A/G radar (e.g., 3.01) and a target designation
occurs with the A/G radar (TGT cursor function), the TGT IR would be
cued to the target (versus the offset) and the target number (i.e., 3.) would
be displayed on the TGT IR format at PB #17. With CUE cursor function
the TGT IR will be cued to the target offset line of sight and TGT IR

PB #17 will reflect the offset syntax.

Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_40.jpeg:
Beware: The DESIGNATE message is overused in the current software.
If TGT is not displayed at PB #7 on the A/G radar display when
DESIGNATE appears, a target for weapon(s) release has not been
designated. CUE and MARK cursor function also provide the
DESIGNATE message.

Cursor Position: To designate the target of interest, put the cursor over
the target or one of its offsets. The fastest and most accurate way to do
this is to step the cursor via the FCP coolie switch or RCP castle switch
and refine with the TDC. Make it a practice to step the cursor to the
target (or offset) to prevent a cursor/PB #17 sequence point mismatch.
When designating, the altitude stored against the PB #17 sequence point
becomes the target elevation, even if the point is the wrong one.

TDC/Trigger: With the cursor over the desired geographic point video,
press the TDC in the FCP or squeeze the hand controller trigger to full
action in the RCP. DESIGNATE appears in the center of the radar screen
for five seconds, the solid or segmented triangle centers over the target or
offset, respectively, and a pattern steering line is initialized over the
target pointing directly away from the aircraft.

Pattern Steering Line (PSL): If designating through the A/G radar, it is
possible to activate the PSL and establish steering to a desired delivery
heading.

e Auto acq aft - moving the auto acq on the FCP stick grip or the RCP
hand controller aft enables the PSL for slewing.

e TDC - eccentric force on the TDC causes the PSL to rotate clockwise
or counterclockwise. The line itself rotates 360° but HUD PSL
steering will not be activated if it will result in a heading change of
more than 30° in either direction from the current line of sight to the
target. Inability to achieve PSL steering is not apparent on the
radar, but the HUD steering cue does not change from an azimuth
steering line to a bank steering bar.

e TDC/trigger - depressing the FCP TDC or the RCP hand controller

trigger to full action designates the PSL. As a result, DESIGNATE
appears on the display for five seconds.

AGD-4 D - 34


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_41.jpeg:
HAT Derivation

HAT derivation for A/G radar designation is almost exactly the same as it
is for a NAV designation. Only SYS is used until 15 TREL. Hsys - Hsp of
the A/G radar PB #17 displayed sequence point is used. If target offset
syntax is displayed at PB #17, the elevation stored against the associated
target is used. If there is no sequence point displayed at PB #17 (“SP” is
displayed), then the CC uses the current aircraft sequence point elevation
as the target elevation.

RALT or AGR may be utilized once the aircraft reaches 15 TREL, but only
if included in the selected hierarchy above SYS. RALT will never be used
if the AUTO hierarchy is selected. The CC’s logic for RALT and AGR is
exactly as previously discussed for a NAV designation.

Factors Affecting Accuracy

INS performance is important to system accuracy because it provides
information to the MN and is the source of stabilization for the radar.

INS/MN present position accuracy has a significant effect on the accuracy
of this method. The sequence point symbols are positioned as a function of
the selected PP keeping source. If the present position is incorrect, the
sequence point symbols will be mispositioned on the radar display making
it more difficult to identify the target or offset. The earth coordinates
generated for the designated target will be in error by the existing PP
error, but the aircraft’s relative position to the target should still be
correct and bombing accuracy is not seriously affected. If a MN velocity
error exists, steering and release errors result. Their magnitudes depend
on the elapsed time between map video construction and weapon(s)
release (drift).

All the standard errors that apply to radar interpretation apply to
designating targets. If the radar is not harmonized properly, component
errors result in an erroneous target relative position. Factors like target
definition and A/G radar video quality influence the ability to identify the
actual target video.

D-35 AGD-4


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_42.jpeg:
Crew Errors

Mismanagement of MN and INS updates is a source of crew error. Ensure
the navigation system is as accurate as possible and guard against
inducing errors by accomplishing bad updates. A PVU to the MN should
be accomplished just before attempting to designate the target (or before
constructing a patch map).

Radar interpretation errors are a factor; utilizing smaller size patch maps
helps quite a bit. Probably the greatest source of error in designating
from the radar lies in cursor placement techniques.

TGT IR

The TGT IR pod can be used to designate the target position relative to
the aircraft. Pod angles along with a range or altitude source are then
used to determine X, Y, Z, which the navigation module transforms into
latitude, longitude, and Ht.

Description

When the crew member in command of the TGT IR display performs a
TGT IR designation, the NAV module determines the target position
relative to the aircraft utilizing pod angles and either a slant range or an
aircraft altitude. The sensor hierarchy scheme used to determine the
designated location is:

e (LAS) - Gif it is the priority sensor and valid) laser range is combined
with pod head pointing angles to calculate the azimuth, range and Ht
(range and Ht from slant range and pod elevation angle).

e (AGR) - [if LAS is invalid, or AGR is the hierarchy sensor (and valid)],
is combined with TGT IR pointing angles to calculate target position
in the same manner as LAS.

e (RALT) - Gf neither laser nor AGR is valid, or RALT is the priority
sensor and valid) is used as height above the target is calculated as
HAT = RALT. Pod pointing angles are used to determine target
azimuth. Pod elevation angle and RALT are used to calculate target
range.

AGD-4 D - 36


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_43.jpeg:
e (SYS) - Gf a sequence point is displayed at PB #17 of the TGT IR
display and its elevation is known) is subtracted from aircraft system
altitude to calculate height (HAT = SYS - Hsp). Again, TGT IR pod
pointing angles are used to determine target azimuth. If the PB #17
elevation is unknown, or PB #17 is SP, current aircraft sequence
point elevation (Hsp) is used as Ht. Lastly, 0 (sea level) is used as
Ht.

e (HRM) - is only available for TGT IR designations. It requires that a
current radar designation (from a HRM patch map) be in effect at the
time of the TGT IR designation. It uses the ground range from the
radar designation, along with pod azimuth and elevation angles, to
determine the location of the TGT IR designation (X, Y, Z) and
subsequently HAT.

e (PASS) - is only available for TGT IR designations. In lieu of any
altitude or range information, it uses aircraft velocity with pod angles
and LOS (gimbal) rates to determine the TGT IR designation location
(X, Y, Z) and subsequently HAT. PASS requires that the designation
is accomplished with the TGT IR in a track mode and initially uses a
range or altitude source (from the target track). PASS accuracy for
HAT (for weapon(s) delivery) is highly dependent on high quality
track through weapons release. It is generally considered a less
desirable capability than those using actual ranging or altitude.

TGT IR/AGR

Prerequisite for using AGR with a TGT IR designation is AGR as the
priority sensor. Additionally, the crew member must initiate a second
take command of the TGT IR display while already in command. This
second take command puts the TGT IR in command of the radar, thus
providing AGR to the pod line of sight. AGR will not slave to the TGT IR
if the radar is tracking an air-to-air target or if the designated
air-to-ground target is outside the radar gimbal limits. In these instances,
“RDR IN USE” or “RDR GIMBAL” messages will be displayed in the
center of the TGT IR video.

Once the TGT IR has command of the radar (in AGR), it retains command
until either crew member takes command of an A/A or A/G radar display,
or the pilot takes command of the HUD or the TGT IR line of sight exceeds
radar gimbal limits.

D-37 AGD-4


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_44.jpeg:
With target relative position and elevation known, the NAV module
calculates the target earth coordinates and designates the target at
lat/long and Ht. This designation is retained until undesignated or
replaced by another designation.

CDES

The target pod can be used to provide a continuous designation of the
target if proper requirements are met. This is the only way to
automatically update the designation while proceeding to the target. All
other methods of designation are single shot designations which can be
updated manually, but in some cases (NAV and CDIP pipper), may not be
practical. Only the LAS, HRM, and PASS are available to calculate the
designation triangle for CDES. With CDES boxed at PB #1 on the target
pod, the designation is updated with new range and line of sight
information as long as that information is valid.

CDES is initiated with the normal one shot designation HOTAS and will
remain in that mode as long as the following conditions are satisfied.

e Point, area, or offset track commanded

e CDES boxed at PB #1

e Target designated via TGT IR display

e No TDC slewing of the target pod

e LAS, HRM, or PASS range selected and valid

If continuous designation is interrupted, the designation remains on the
last valid designation update until the aircrew redesignates, or if the slew

was initiated in cursor function TGT, when TDC slewing stops and range
source is still valid.

AGD-4 D - 38


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_45.jpeg:
Factors Affecting Accuracy

Meteorological conditions have a pronounced effect on this mode of
designation. The IR signature of the target must be good enough to
clearly identify the target.

INS and MN performance play essentially the same role in a TGT IR
designation as in an A/G radar designation. Since the designation is an
aircraft-to-target relative position perspective, PP error will not affect the
designation, assuming the target can be found with the TGT IR.

If the pod is not properly aligned, it may be difficult to find the target, and
the target relative position will be incorrectly computed when designating.
Video quality on the MPD will affect the ability to recognize the target.

When the target pod is cued (TSD, A/G RDR, NAV or a HUD designation,
quick stepping the pod), PB #17 on the TGT IR pod will show the target
number or SP and how the pod was cued.

Crew Errors

Mismanagement of MN and INS updates is a source of crew error.

Present position is particularly important if the TGT IR pod is cued from a
NAV designation. Best available velocities are important to minimize
system drift from the time of designation to the time of weapon(s) release,
although the time interval between TGT IR designation and weapon(s)
release is generally short (less than two minutes). Consider a PVU of the
MN within five minutes of weapon(s) release and before designation.

HUD DESIGNATIONS

There are two ways to designate a target and one way to redesignate a
target using the symbology presented in the HUD with the A/G master
mode selected. The available methods depend on which weapons delivery
mode is selected. First is with the AUTO pipper and no previous
designation. Second is with the CDIP pipper with or without a previous
designation. The final method is actually changing a previous designation
by moving the target designator (TD) diamond in the HUD.

HUD Pipper

This method uses the location (az/el) of the AUTO or CDIP pipper and
LAS/AGR ranging, RALT or SYS to determine the target position relative
to the aircraft. This is referenced to MN present position to calculate
target earth coordinates. The 1 mil or 2 mil pipper (as selected on the
HUD repeater display) can be used.

Description

The pipper method requires visual conditions in the target area; it can be
used in conjunction with a diving AUTO delivery profile which is similar
to dive toss in other aircraft. In the computed deliveries lesson, this is
referred to as “undesignated AUTO.” It is always used when weapon(s)
release is generated in CDIP delivery mode.

In undesignated AUTO or any CDIP (designated or undesignated
delivery), when either crew member presses the pickle button or the pilot
depresses the TDC while in command of the HUD, the ground location
overlaid by the pipper becomes the designated target. The hierarchy of
laser range, radar range, or system altitude minus sequence point
elevation is used if the auto sensor priority is selected. If the manual
sensor hierarchy is utilized the aircrew can add RALT and adjust the
hierarchy order.

Once the target’s relative position and elevation are known, the NAV
module calculates the target earth coordinates and designates the target
at lat/long and Ht. This designation is retained until undesignated or
replaced by another designation. Following the designation, the NAV
module completes all of the required coordinate transformations and
sends them to the data base for use by avionic systems as required.

Procedures
Refer to Figures D-11 and D-12 in reading these procedures.

A/G Master Mode: The AUTO or CDIP pipper is displayed only in A/G
master mode. You must be in the A/G master mode to designate a target
with the pipper.

Master Arm: This switch must be in ARM to utilize the pickle button.
(The TDC can be used with the master arm in either SAFE or ARM).

PACS Program: Pipper designation functions in both AUTO and CDIP;
therefore, select either one. (Expanded CDIP procedures are addressed in
a later lesson.)

e AUTO (Figure D-12) - There must be no other prior designation at
pickle in this mode (undesignated AUTO). In designated AUTO the
pickle button serves only as a consent to release; it does not affect the
current designation.

e CDIP (Figure D-11) - Designation/redesignation occurs at pickle.
Therefore, this method can be used in either designated or
undesignated CDIP.

Take Command of HUD: To have radar/laser ranging available, the pilot
must ensure the radar (AGR) and/or TGT IR pod are slaved to the HUD.
HUD command is not required for a pipper designation with the pickle
button, however it is required for a pipper designation with the TDC.

Pipper on Target: Fly to place the pipper on the target. In the case of an
AUTO delivery, the pipper is coincident with the velocity vector.
Alternately, the pilot can slew the AUTO reticle within the HUD FOV
under the following conditions.

e A/Gmaster mode selected.

e HUD command.

AGD-4 D - 44


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_51.jpeg:
e Undesignated AUTO without depressing the TDC, the pilot slews the
HUD reticle. When the TDC is released, the reticle is HUD stabilized
at its current position. When the pickle button (or TDC) is pressed, a
target is designated at the reticle position and the reticle returns to
the velocity vector. The TD diamond appears at the designated
location. If the pilot slews the reticle and then desires to return it to
the velocity vector (without designating a target) he can do so by
pressing and releasing the nose gear steering button.

Figure D - 12. Pipper Designation (Undesignated AUTO).

Once a designation is created (by any of the designation methods) with
HUD command and using the TDC (depressing, then slewing), the pilot
can reposition the designation. Remember, slewing without depressing
the TDC slews the undesignated AUTO pipper. The new designation
occurs when the TDC is released. LAS, AGR, SYS, or RALT can be used
to determine the position of the new target.

HUD Redesignation

The TD method can also be used to change the location of an existing
designation. This method is not normally used if you are attempting to
drop on the target on the same pass as you intend to redesignate. As with
the two previous pipper designation methods, you must first find the
target visually before making a successful redesignation.

AGD-4 D - 46


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_53.jpeg:
Once the redesignation occurs, the designation triangle is recomputed
with the appropriate changes in the steering to the weapons release point.

With A/G master mode and an existing designation that is within the
HUD FOV, a TD diamond is displayed on the HUD. If the pilot has
command of the HUD, depressing and holding the TDC allows
repositioning the diamond by slewing the TDC. Once the TDC is released,
the new location is designated. The target pod should remain cued to the
TD as it moves to the new location, and the steering will change when the
pilot releases the TDC. (Redesignation computations are not performed
until the TDC is released.)

HUD Designations and AGR

When the pilot takes command of the HUD, the radar enters AGR at the
undesignated AUTO or the CDIP pipper. In designated AUTO, AGR is to
the target diamond line of sight. The radar must not be supporting an
in-flight MRM. Normal AGR validity checks apply for the AGR to be used
in HAT computations (greater than 1.25° graze angle; + 15,000 feet, -
10,000 feet from existing designation and target designation within radar
gimbal limits). A double request will allow a crew member to take
command of the A/A or A/G radar or to take command of the AGR with the
TGT IR pod. If AGR is achieved, slant range (digital and analog bar) is
displayed on the HUD. AGR will not be used for Ht/HAT calculations
unless it is the priority sensor.

HUD Designations and LAS

A double take command of the HUD in A/G master mode will slave the
TGT IR to the HUD if LAS is included in the current HAT hierarchy and
the TGT IR is in the A/G mode and not in a track mode. The TGT IR will
be slaved to the undesignated AUTO or CDIP pipper or to the designated
AUTO target diamond. LAS will only be used if the pod is slaved to a
HUD reference with LAS ranging digital/analog range available on the
HUD (i.e., valid ranging).

For LAS to be used, the TGT IR pod must be slaved to the TD diamond
(designated AUTO, second take command of the HUD).

Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_54.jpeg:
Factors Affecting Accuracy

For all the HUD designation methods, the target must be visible.
Anything which hampers sighting the target (darkness, clouds, terrain,
etc.) hampers use of this mode. Range and altitude source are quite
significant. The aircrew should select the most appropriate hierarchy on
the A/G delivery display. Again, LAS, AGR, RALT, or SYS can be used.

System harmonization may be a problem since the pilot is virtually
always sighting via one system and measuring via another.

Large MN position errors may preclude steering that is accurate enough
to visually acquire the target.

Small INS/MN velocity errors have little effect [from designation to
weapon(s) release] due to the short ranges involved. Present position
errors result in an error in computing the target lat/long, but this should
not seriously affect the accuracy of the bombing system, if aircraft to
target relative position is accurate.

Crew Errors

Mismanagement of MN and INS updates is a source of crew error. Make
sure the navigation system is as accurate as possible. A bad update
produces an inaccurate navigation system which could result in inability
to visually acquire the target.

Failing to take command of the HUD prevents using the TDC (to slew the
reticle, designate the reticle, or slew the TD diamond). Command of the
radar and TGT IR pod through the HUD also requires HUD command.

The slew rate of the TD diamond is quite high, and it is very easy to slew
the diamond off the target as the TDC is released, particularly when close
to the target. The same is true when slewing the AUTO reticle. The crew
workload must also be considered before attempting to use the HUD
methods of designating and redesignating. In most situations a good plan
will allow the WSO to find the target in the TGT IR and designate using
the 16 power magnification capability of the target pod. In this case, it is
likely the option of changing the designation with the HUD is liable to
induce positioning errors.

Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_55.jpeg:
Zero Point

This is a form of NAV designation, in that the computations are sourced
entirely within the NAV module, like the NAV designation. Outside
sensor information is not required.

Description

A zero point designation is essentially the reverse of the NAV designation
method. Rather than starting with stored target earth coordinates and
finding target relative position, the NAV module starts with a stored
relative position, and generates earth coordinates. The crew enters the
target’s relative position from a known visual point via the UFC against a
unique sequence point (0.) syntax.

When over the visual IP, the crew enters 0. as the aircraft current
sequence point. At the 0. entry, the MN adds the stored target relative
position (from the visual point) to the visual position and designates the
target at lat/long and Ht. This designation is retained until undesignated
or replaced by a new designation. At this time, the NAV module
completes all of the required coordinate transformations and sends them
to the data base for use by avionic systems as required. Altitude sourcing
is determined using the same priority as is used for the radar and NAV
designation options (e.g., SYS), with the capability to use AGR or RALT
inside 15 seconds TREL (if selected and valid).

Enter 0.: When over the visual IP with 0. waiting in the scratchpad, press
PB #10 on the UFC. This should immediately give you steering to the
wind-corrected weapon(s) release point. The HUD symbology will change
from NAV information to a designated AUTO or CDIP presentation.

Next Steer Point: Though not required to designate, this step is mentioned
because the system will not auto-sequence and you must enter the next
point including the route identifier (e.g., 17A) when steering to the target
is no longer desired.

Factors Affecting Accuracy

Like the other visual methods, anything that hampers sighting the visual
point limits the method.

If the RNG/BRG is entered, it is only possible to enter offsets to the
nearest degree and one-tenth of a nautical mile. This may be a bit coarse
for targeting purposes. If possible, use direction and range offsets. This is
viable if planning a 0. backup to use in the event of a navigation system
gross error.

Even though MN present position is used to determine the target’s earth
coordinates, it is not terribly important to bombing accuracy. The
accuracy of the designation for bombing purposes is driven by the
accuracy of the relative position of the target at 0. entry. MN velocity
errors may be a problem if the solution time (IP to target) is long.

Crew Errors

The principal sources of crew error with this method occur in data
measurements entry and precision of designating over the visual point.

Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_59.jpeg:
UNDESIGNATION
Purpose

There are several valid reasons for undesignating targets. Remember,
there is room in memory for only one designation. So, to hit a new target,
or just refine the current designation, it is necessary to have some way of
eliminating the old target. In some cases, this is done by overwriting the
existing designation. For some designation methods, however, the
designation must be blank; these methods do not overwrite. NAV
designation and AUTO pipper designation do not overwrite existing
designations; they are only possible from an undesignated condition.

Use caution in blindly undesignating, since undesignating does not return
to the previous designation. It erases the designation, leaving only NAV
steering (or no steering if an unprogrammed target of opportunity was
designated). In the case of zero point, the system does not step to the next
point. The next point must be entered, which erases the designation
register.

Procedures

There are essentially three ways to undesignate A/G targets: the boat
switch in the FCP, the hand controller auto acq in the RCP, or the UFC in
either cockpit.

Boat Switch

A/G Master Mode: Using the boat switch on the FCP throttle to
undesignate A/G targets requires A/G master mode. Additionally, the
pilot must not be in command of the A/A radar.

Boat Switch Aft: Moving the boat switch aft undesignates the A/G target
regardless of the method of designation. If the PSL had been activated
and designated, the first aft movement of the boat switch undesignates
the PSL and a second aft movement of the boat switch undesignates the
target.

AGD-4 C-2


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_60.jpeg:
Hand Controller Auto Acq

Sensor Command: To use the RCP hand controller to undesignate a
target, that hand controller must be assigned command of the A/G radar
or TGT IR and the target cursor function must be selected.

Auto Acq: Pressing down on the hand controller auto acq undesignates
the target. If the PSL had been activated and designated, the first
depression of the auto acq switch undesignates the PSL and a second
downward movement of the auto acq switch undesignates the target. The
A/G radar and TGT IR can be used to undesignate any target, regardless
of the method used to designate the target.

UFC

A/G Master Mode: Using the UFC method to undesignate a target
requires A/G master mode.

Steer Point Entry: Entry of a new current aircraft sequence point into the
UFC Data 1 or Menu 1 undesignates the target. If the NAV master mode
is selected and a new current aircraft sequence point is entered (either
manually or via auto-sequencing), the system provides steering to the next
point, but the target does not undesignate. Reentry into the A/G master
mode will again provide steering to the previously designated target.

EMPLOYMENT

There are several ways to designate a target. See designate/
redesignate and IP-to-target run examples on the following pages.

The Scenario

For purposes of discussion, let us suppose you have planned to make a low
level ingress to a level attack in marginal weather (Figure D-15). You
have planned the route and have loaded all the pertinent route data into
the CC. You are flying the route and all is going well. As you get within
40 nm of the target, you consider a designation. You have checked the
MN and it is performing well. Before each designation, perform a MN
PVU (or use the IPVU option). A system altitude update may be desired.
If so, it should be performed at release TAS and MSL altitude if able.

Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_62.jpeg:
Radar Designation

The only sensor you have that can possibly detect the target from long
range is the radar. At that, you have to climb to at least 1500 feet to
achieve LOS to the target. You may choose to climb briefly to make a
patch map of the target area. An A/G radar designation of the target
(versus an offset) from a .67 patch map (must be less than 40 nm from the
target) will produce the best accuracy. Consider using an expanded patch
map.

Satisfied you have a good map, freeze it and identify the target or offset.
Confirm PB #17 is correct and update/designate the target or offset. With
an update, you know your MN is accurate which means an accurate NAV
designation if you need it. If the target is on the radar display, you know
you have designated when the PSL appears over the target triangle.

NAV Designation

If your A/G radar designation was unsuccessful or not practical, a NAV
designation entering the target area is a likely option. As previously
covered, the method only works if no other designation exists. It does not
overwrite an existing designation. Select the A/G master mode; if no other
designation exists (no old one left over from a previous attack), when the
target point sequences, it is designated. The target is designated if the
destination line of the HUD data block reads “TGT” and the distance to
the target is preceded by a G versus an N. If you were successful in
getting the radar designation before selecting A/G master mode, this NAV
designation does not occur.

AGD-4 D - 56


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_63.jpeg:
TGT IR Designation

About a minute out from the target, start getting ready for the TGT IR
designation. It provides a more accurate designation, can provide
continuous designation, and provides laser energy on the target for
ranging and weapon guidance purposes. When designating with the TGT
IR, if a previous designation existed, there is no good indication the
designation has occurred if steering does not change.

Backups

You will use the above progression most of the time, but there are
alternatives. If you happen to visually acquire the target and note the
diamond is not over it, slew the diamond in a TD redesignation.
Alternately with target visual acquisition, AUTO or CDIP pipper
designations are available. The zero point method is available as a last
ditch, provided you have planned and entered the required offset data.

AUTONOMOUS LANDING GUIDANCE (ALG)

In addition to attacking surface targets, designations may also be used to
establish a touchdown point for use in the ALG mode. The ALG mode
provides “ILS-like” steering to any designated point on the ground.

To employ the ALG mode, the crew must be in the NAV or INST master
mode with a designation (NAV, A/G radar, TGT IR, HUD) and select ALG
at PB #5 of the HSI (Figure D-16). Once the touchdown point is
designated, the crew selects the final approach course using PBs #14 and
#15 on the HSI or by aligning the PSL on a radar designation with the
desired course. The CC plots a final approach fix (FAF) 10 nm from the
touchdown point. Steering to the touchdown point is via the selected
course. The PLAN view on the HSI is utilized to navigate to the ALG
FAF.

deviation from a 3° glide slope to the designated touchdown point. There

There is no current operational guidance on how ALG may be used, but it

terrain clearance. By arriving at the ALG FAF at 3000 feet AGL above
the designated touchdown point elevation, the aircrew can fly a 8° glide
slope from the FAF. The touchdown point elevation is determined by the
same methods used to determine target elevation during target
designation (designation method and HAT hierarchy).

ROLE OF THE NAVIGATION (NAV) MODULE

The navigation module is the CC program element (a set of computer
algorithms) which provides the F-15E with the capability to accomplish
attitude reference and present position keeping, target designation/
undesignation, navigation steering and symbol placement, reference
system coordinate transformations, and sensor pointing. The NAV
module has other functions not germane to this discussion. Figure D-1
shows the relationship of the navigation module with other avionics in the
aircraft. This diagram has both before and after the installation of the
embedded global positioning system/inertial navigation system (EGI).

The central computer takes inputs from various sensors an positions
others in the process of designating a target. This mission navigator (MN)
is a computer subroutine within the NAV module which handles the bulk
of these functions.

Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_8.jpeg:
The MN calculates aircraft position independently from the FNU INS or
EGI. To do this, it must be supplied with its starting position and
continuous velocity (direction and magnitude) information.

Before EGI (86-0183 Through 92-0366 Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

Position Keeping (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

Starting Position: There are two sources of MN starting position: INS or
TACAN. This starting position is used only to initiate the MN and, during
a reset operation, to reinitiate the MN at the INS (or TACAN, if TACAN is
selected as the PP keeping source) present position (PP).

Velocities: Velocities are supplied by the INS (or the air data computer/
AHRS). The aircrew can modify the velocity used by the MN by
accomplishing a precision velocity update (PVU). Ina PVU, the
radar-measured velocities are compared to the INS-measured velocities
and delta velocities calculated. If the crew accepts the PVU, these delta
velocities are added to the INS reported velocities before they enter the
MN. After five minutes (or immediately after an INS PVU or following a
PVU CLR), the deltas are no longer applied and the MN once again uses
the velocities as reported by the INS. In the case of an interleaved
precision velocity update (IPVU), the delta velocities are computed once
every minute, the process is continuous, and the deltas are automatically
accepted with no aircrew action required (if the radar is functioning in a
PPI mode).

Present Position: The MN integrates velocities over time to determine
position changes which are then added to starting position to calculate
present position. Since the integration process is slower and has less
internal accuracy than the one used by the INS, after a time the MN and
INS positions disagree. If the MN present position is updated, the
calculated delta PP is added to the MN present position existing at the
moment of update. This essentially creates a new starting position from
which to calculate PP. A position update of the MN does not affect MN
velocities. If you update the INS position, the MN PP is reset to the INS.
The MN present position is sent to the CC data base for use as required
for pointing sensors, designating targets, placing navigation symbology,
and determining steering.

AGD-4 D-2


Text from AGD-4_Designations_page_9.jpeg:
After EGI (96-0200 and up or After TCTO 1F-15E-737)

When the aircraft is modified with the embedded GPS/INS (EGI) the role
of the mission navigator will be changed significantly. The data which is
used for navigation, steering, and weapon delivery computations is
provided by different sources, dependent on the present position keeping
source (PPKS). Because of the improved accuracy of the GPS position and
velocity measurements, the mission navigator will normally be relegated
to the backup mode in positioning for weapons deliveries.

Position Keeping (After TCTO 1F-15E-737)

Starting Position: The TACAN starting position for the mission navigator
will be replaced by the EGI. This gives two sources of MN starting
position: the EGI and the current INS (fighter navigation unit [FNU]
INS). Either can be selected to update the position of the MN. However,
for a MN reset, only the FNU INS position will be used to reset the MN
position. If the FNU INS position is invalid, the MN reset cannot be done.

Velocities: The velocities used by the MN to keep track of its position
continue to come from the FNU INS. The requirement for MN PVUs and
FNU INS PVUs remains, if the EGI is not the PPKS.

Present Position: The options for present position keeping will be the EGI,

deleted. The air data computer (ADC) source is retained as a default
PPKS, but is no longer aircrew selectable. The PPKS defaults to FNU
INS upon startup, and must be changed by the aircrew if something other
than FNU INS is desired. If the selected PPKS is not available, then the
PPKS will default as shown in Table D-1.

AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_10.jpeg:
Air Data Computer (ADC)

The ADC provides true airspeed, air density, and angle of attack to the CC
for use by the A/G module. The temperature corrected ADC pressure
altitude, aided by inertial velocities, is system altitude (SYSB), and is used
for height above target computations. Some of the information (airspeed
and Mach) is needed for the ballistics computations. Other information
(altitude) is used if the mission NAV determines that particular
information is the best available.

Reference System

The INS and AHRS deposit pitch, roll, heading, and inertial velocities
data into the CC data base to be used as required by the mission NAV and
the A/G module.

Equipment (96-0200 and up or after TCTO 1F-15E-737, Embedded
GPS/INS)

The central computer, multipurpose display processor, head-up display,
multipurpose display/color display and programmable armament control
set remain essentially the same. However, the air data computer and
reference system have changed.

Air Data Processor (ADP)

The air data computer has been replaced by the ADP. This change is
transparent to the operator. The system altitude is present position
keeping source (PPKS) selection dependent. With the EGI as the PPKS
EGI altitude outputs are taken into the position/velocity consistency
(PVC) filter into the CC. This filter uses EGI blended altitude and
blended vertical velocity to produce the system altitude (SYSG) which
provides stable and consistent data for weapons delivery computations.
For any PPKS other than EGI the system altitude (SYSB) is the
temperature corrected pressure altitude aided by FNU INS velocities.

Reference System
With the EGI selected as the PPKS EGI position and velocities are also

used for the weapons delivery computations. The FNU INS provides the
primary attitude, heading, attitude rates and accelerations.

Switches and Controls

Quite a few switches are needed to set up the AUTO delivery mode. Many
of these (PACS primarily) can be programmed using the DTM or can be
set before takeoff.

A/G Master Mode

The A/G master mode enables the bomb release circuits. It takes the
pickle button out of the A/A release circuitry. Additionally, it initiates the
A/G module and permits air-to-ground symbology to be displayed on the
HUD.

MPD/MPCD

The MPD/MPCD and its push buttons provide the means to select one of
four ARMT programs, define an AUTO program, select armament, and
select sequencing and fuzing options on the PACS. The displays and push
buttons also allow the input of weapon delivery variables, selection of
sensor hierarchy, and status display via the A/G DLVRY and associated
PROG formats. Most designation methods also require a functional
MPD/MPCD.

Master Arm Switch

The master arm must be placed in ARM to enable the release circuits,
obtain a PACS ready, and generate the HUD gun cross and mode
indicator (AUTO) in the HUD data block.

Pickle Button

In AUTO, the pickle button normally provides release consent.
Additionally, it designates a target if designation did not occur prior to
pickle.

Release Programming

Full PACS release sequencing is available. Simply establish an AUTO
program and select the desired release options. For ripple programs, the
CC computes for the center point of a string as a default, but allows the
option of defining which bomb/salvo in a string will exactly hit the target.
When this option is selected with both LC and RC stations selected,
steering will bracket the target in azimuth based on TCFT PACS loading.

D-5 AGD-5


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_12.jpeg:
Data Transfer Module (DTM) (Before TCTO 1F-15E-700)

During preflight, all the PACS combat and training weapons data and
four combat plus four training A/G programs can be transferred into the
aircraft through the DTM. Remember the CC will not accept DTM PACS
weapon loading data unless both the A/A and A/G combat modes are
selected.

DMS Mission Cartridge / Data Transfer Module (MC / DTM) (96-0200 and
up or after TCTO 1F-15E-700)

After the DMS is installed the DMS mission cartridge is the primary
means to read mission data to the CC and to write recorded mission
events and maintenance data from the CC.

The DTM and receptacle may also be used by the aircrew to read mission
data and write mission events and maintenance data.

Armament (ARMT)

The ARMT display on any MPD/MPCD is your access to the PACS. With
at least one loaded station boxed you can select an AUTO or CDIP
delivery option. Selecting the station enables the pull-up cue to be
displayed based on the frag of the weapon loaded. AUTO appears above
PB #6 indicating the selected PACS program is set up for the AUTO
delivery mode. After selecting single or multiple releases, quantity and
spacing options, and compatible fuzing, you will have a valid PACS
program. No legends should remain below “OPTIONS” at the bottom of
the display. Remember, once you have a program established, you can
change parameters such as quantity, interval, or fuze options at will.
Using the conventional PACS, the armament display for AUTO looks like
Figure D-2.

A/G Programming

The A/G DLVRY (Figure D-3) and A/G DLVRY PROG (Figure D-4) page
formats play a significant part in CC programming. It is through these
displays that the CC determines its priority for using sensor information
to compute height above target (HAT) or height above ground (HAG) for
the vertical component of the bombing triangle. The A/G module uses this

information for bomb range and time of fall computations.

In addition, parameters that affect HUD steering displays such as loft
angle and AT/CT are input or modified through these pages. The loft
angle programmed is used by the CC to present time to the predicted
pull-up point and provide pitch steering to the climb angle desired for the
delivery. AT biases adjust the range aim point while CT biases adjust the
steering for known or observed azimuth errors.

AGD-5


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_14.jpeg:
The CC also uses the time to arm and minimum recovery altitude (MRA)
programmed by the aircrew as part of its calculation for display of the

pull-up cue during delivery.

A wind model is available on MPD/MPCD Menu 2 for selection as a
display programming option. It allows the aircrew to input or capture
wind speed and direction at up to 10 specific altitudes. The CC uses this
data to provide a wind-corrected impact point. This information is
presented on the HUD as steering to an upwind aim point offsetting the
winds identified from the aircraft wind model.

AGD-5


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_16.jpeg:
This is especially important for situations where the weapon is subjected
to wind effects for longer periods of time such as medium and high
altitude attacks or the use of high drag weapons.

The wind model data affects the computed ballistics for most A/G weapons
released in AUTO, CDIP, LADD, and CDIP GUN. It does not affect the
ballistics for any weapons released in DIRECT or MANUAL (FF/RET).
The following weapons are unaffected by wind model data in any mode:
AGM-65, GBU-24, or GBU-28.

Altitude, wind speed, and wind true direction may be entered into ten
data points by one of four methods.

e DTM or MC/DTM (96-0200 and up or after TCTO
1F-15E-700) read.

e Manually via UFC scratchpad and MPD/MPCD transfer.
e Automatic capture at programmed altitudes.
e Selective capture at the current altitude by aircrew.
When capturing winds, manual or automatic, captured data will be less
accurate when roll rate exceeds 5°/second or yaw rate exceeds 3°/second

due to wind measuring limitations. Wind data is filtered during heavy
maneuvering.

WIND MODEL AGD-05-05

Figure D - 5. Wind Model Display.

Current system altitude (same as displayed on the UFC and TGT IR
UPDT display) and true wind direction/speed are displayed near the top of
the display. OFF is shown if system altitude is invalid. The wind data is
never invalid, but may be frozen if TAS is less than 80 knots, the present
position keeping source (PPKS) is A/D, or the PPKS is TCN (86-0183
through 92-0366 before TCTO 1F-15E-737, EGD with aircrew wind data
entered on the UFC.

A table of 10 wind data points is displayed below the system altitude and
wind. A selection box is used to identify the point being entered, updated,
or deleted.

Clear Wind (CLR WIND)

Pressing PB #1 clears all wind values from the display and the wind
model. All altitudes will remain unchanged.

D-11 AGD-5


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_18.jpeg:
Clear All (CLR ALL)

Pressing PB #2 clears the entire wind table. It clears all altitudes and
wind directions/speed, unboxes AUTO (if boxed), the wind point number at
PB 46 is 1, and the selection box is placed at point 1.

Sort

Pressing PB #4 puts the table in order of ascending altitude. It unboxes
AUTO (if boxed) and places the selection box at the first empty data
location (altitude or wind). The selection box moves to point 1 if the table
is full.

Wind Point Number

The wind point number shows the location of the selection box. If PB #6 is
pressed with an empty scratchpad, the selection box moves to the next
data point. If PB #6 is pressed with a valid wind point number in the
scratchpad, the selection box moves to that point. AUTO becomes
unboxed when the selection box is moved manually.

Altitude

Pressing PB #8 with a valid altitude entry in the scratchpad (-99,999 thru
99,999 in 1-foot increments) puts the scratchpad altitude into the selected
point, or if the altitude already exists in the table, moves the selection box
to that point. Altitudes in the wind table are rounded to the nearest 10
feet. AUTO becomes unboxed when manually entering altitudes.

Wind

Pressing PB #10 with a valid wind speed and direction in the scratchpad
puts the scratchpad wind into the selected point. AUTO becomes unboxed
when manually entering wind. For a wind to be valid and used by the
systems for wind model calculations, it must have both an altitude and
wind speed/direction entered on the wind model display.

Wind is typed into the scratchpad as true direction (0° thru 360°), a dash
(-), and the speed in knots. Trailing zeroes are not required for the
direction. Leading zeroes are not required for speed. The dash may be
omitted if all six digits are typed.

AGD-5 D-12


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_19.jpeg:
Capture Point (CAPT PT)

Pressing PB #16 captures the current system altitude and wind, puts
them into the selection box, and moves the box to the next point. AUTO
becomes unboxed when manually commanding wind capture. CAPT PT is
not displayed if system altitude is invalid.

AUTO

Boxing PB #18 sets up the system to automatically capture at the
altitudes that have been entered into the table. It automatically sorts the
table in order of ascending altitude and puts the selection box at the first
anticipated wind point (based on altitude). As the aircraft passes each
stored altitude, the true wind direction and speed are automatically
captured and the selection box is moved to the next anticipated point.
Wind capture continues as long as PB #18 is boxed, continuously updating
every time the aircraft passes through a programmed altitude. Unbox

PB #18 to stop automatic wind capture. AUTO is automatically unboxed
anytime manual changes are made to the wind table.

At power up, AUTO is boxed by default. If system altitude is invalid,
AUTO may still be selected but wind capture will not occur.

Clear Point (CLR PT)
Pressing PB #20 clears all the data at the selected point and moves the

selection box to the next data point. AUTO becomes unboxed when a
point is manually cleared.

Wind Model Calculations

Wind is factored into the CC ballistics calculations in one of three ways
based on the number of wind points entered by the aircrew.

No Valid Wind Points
If there are no data points in the wind model at pickle, the CC captures

the instantaneous wind (displayed under SYS and WIND) and assumes a
linear reduction in velocity to zero knots at -4000 feet MSL (Figure D-6).

AUTO Delivery Symbology
HUD Symbology

The HUD (Figure D-9) provides azimuth steering information to the
target, a target symbol to visually acquire the target, and visual cues to
anticipate the computer release of the bombs.

The data block in the lower right corner of the HUD provides navigation
and weapon release data. This block contains the target identification,
ground range to the target, time to the next event, a PACS mode
indicator, and sensor being used for HAT computations. The weapon
delivery sensor will be dependent on the automatic or manual sensor
hierarchy selection and validity. The indication will include a “C” prefix
when the targeting pod is in continuous designation mode. Digital slant
range is displayed above the target identification when valid radar or
laser ranging is available. TRNG displayed at the bottom of the data
block indicates the training PACS is selected.

Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_24.jpeg:
Heading

The heading caret displays current heading as in all other HUD modes.
Initially, the command heading bug displays the heading to overfly the
target. After target designation, it displays the heading to fly to reach the
proper upwind release point.

A/G Reticle

The reticle is displayed coincident with the velocity vector. It consists of a
50 mil diameter solid circle and a 2 mil pipper (dot) in the center or a 25
mil circle with a 1 mil pipper selectable via the HUD repeater format at
PB #5. The pipper in AUTO mode is fixed in the center of the velocity
vector.

An analog range bar wraps around the inside of the large reticle
displaying radar or laser slant range to the target. Each clock position of
the range bar represents 1000 feet; the bar wraps around twice for a
maximum displayed range of 23,000 feet. An index on the end of the bar
indicates the range displayed. A tic mark replaces the range bar with the
small reticle displayed. The tic for ranges 0 to 11,999 feet is half the size
of the tic mark used for 12,000 to 23,000 feet. In either case, the range
bar is normally displayed if LAS or AGR is selected and valid. It is
removed if they are selected but go invalid. It is not displayed if RALT or
SYSB is selected.

Target Designator Diamond

The target designator (TD) diamond is a line of sight reference to the
designated target. The TD diamond flashes at the appropriate edge of the
HUD when the target is within 1.5° of a vertical or horizontal edge of the
HUD and continues to be displayed as long as the target is within 60° of
the nose. If the target is beyond 60° of the nose, the symbol is not
displayed.

In command of the HUD, the TD diamond can be used to designate a
target by pressing the FCP TDC and then slewing the diamond. Upon
releasing the TDC after slewing (if necessary), a target is designated at
the TD diamond LOS and the diamond is ground stabilized. If the HUD
reticle was slewed prior to designating, it is returned to the velocity
vector.

AGD-5 D-18


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_25.jpeg:
Azimuth Steering Line (ASL)

The ASL is displayed vertically relative to the earth and extends from the
top of the TD diamond to the top of the HUD. Wind effects may displace
the ASL left or right of the TD diamond. Flying to place the velocity
vector over the ASL provides steering to the wind-corrected release point.
When the target is outside the HUD field of view, the ASL is displayed at
the appropriate HUD limit. If the pattern steering line (PSL) is
designated on the A/G radar, the ASL is replaced by a bank steering bar
when outside of 15 seconds TREL.

Elevation Steering Line (ESL)

The ESL provides steering commands to achieve either a max range loft or
a specific loft angle, up to 45°, programmed on the A/G DLVRY display
format. The ESL is displayed perpendicular to the azimuth steering line
(ASL). It provides a 4 G pull-up to the selected loft angle. The ESL comes
on at five seconds TPULL and initially appears at the velocity vector
unless the TF radar is on. In this case, it appears at the pitch command
line or box. To disable the ESL, set loft angle to 0° or designate a PSL.
The ESL is unavailable when high drag weapons are selected. It is
removed when the target is overflown, aircraft G and commanded G differ
by 2.5, or weapon release is complete.

Time To Pull (TPULL)
If a loft angle is programmed, TPULL is displayed in minutes and seconds
until the pull-up is required to begin the delivery. TPULL only displays

when the aircraft heading is +60° of the heading to the target. The ESL
comes on five seconds prior to the expiration of TPULL.

D-19 AGD-5


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_26.jpeg:
Pull-up Cue
The pull-up cue (Figure D-10) computations include weapon dud
conditions, fragmentation damage conditions, and programmed minimum
recovery altitude to indicate a pull-up to prevent dud (D) ordnance,
frag (F) damage or the violation of MRA (M). The velocity vector should
be above the pull-up cue at release/detonation to avoid violating the
indicated condition. Do not confuse the pull-up cue with loft elevation

Pull-up Cue Condition

When the aircraft flight conditions violate the criteria (pull-up cue above
velocity vector), the condition is shown by a letter F, D, or M

(Figure D-10). When F (fragmentation envelope) or M (minimum recovery
altitude) is displayed, clearance altitudes are based on 5 G pull-up
attained in two seconds for ripple releases. The D (dud) cue, when
appropriate, is displayed for the first bomb in the release sequence and is
maintained until the pickle button is released.

The pull-up cue and condition require A/G MM for display. F and D are
shown with the master arm in ARM and weapon selected for AUTO and
CDIP modes. (F is also displayed for guided mode; D is not.) Ground
range must be less than 15 nm to the target for F. M only requires A/G
MM and aircraft altitude lower than programmed.

Release Cue

The release cue appears at 10 seconds prior to release. It is centered on
and perpendicular to the ASL, and is initially positioned 5° above the
velocity vector. As the release point is approached, the release cue moves
down the ASL. When the release cue reaches the velocity vector, release
occurs if the pickle button is being held down.

Time To Release (TREL)

TREL is displayed when TPULL expires. TREL indicates time remaining
to weapon release. TREL will be displayed when the aircraft heading is
within 20° of the ASL and 0° is entered for a loft angle (level delivery).

Time To Target (TTGT)

TTGT is displayed in all A/G modes except manual.

Time To Impact (TIMPCT)

After weapon release, TIMPCT is displayed on the HUD, on the TGT IR,
and in the TEWS and HSI NAV data blocks. (The legend “TIMPCT” is not
shown on the TEWS or HSI, just the time.) TIMPCT counts down to 0:00
in one second intervals and then displays “:_ _” for TOF plus 10% until

being removed. (The pad time for LGB and SUU-20 is 10% or 10 seconds,
whichever is greater.

HSI

While the HSI (Figure D-11) may not be the most desirable choice of
displays during an attack, it does display useful attack/reattack steering
information. This information may be particularly valuable in the event
of HUD failure.

A/G Event Data

The A/G EVENT display enables the crew to review A/G weapon delivery
data, target data, and delivery parameter data. Each time the CC
generates a release, it stores this data for computed deliveries. The
EVENT format (Figure D-12) is entered by selecting EVENT (PB #19) on
MPD/MPCD Menu 1. A total of 20 events can be recorded in the CC. The
event number (PB #16) can be changed through the UFC scratchpad and
subsequent depression of PB #16; or incrementally by one to a maximum
of 20 and then back to one by depressions of PB #16.

During postflight, all the A/G event data plus additional weapons delivery
parameters can be written to the MC/DTM for analysis.

AUTO DELIVERIES

AUTO is used to deliver bombs using virtually any type profile: climbing,
level, and diving. Since the CC is continuously computing bomb range
and comparing it to range to go to the designated target, the pilot has
complete use of the vertical for maneuvering. Vertical maneuvering may
take the form of level, dive, dive toss or loft delivery parameters. Azimuth
error must be nulled to hit the target.

LOFT

The LOFT climbing profile in AUTO is available for low drag, unretarded
nuclear and conventional weapons. LOFT commands are provided
automatically in the AUTO mode if a target is designated far enough out,
a pattern steering line is not designated, loft angle is not programmed for
0°, and a high drag weapon is not selected on the PACS display.

LOFT is a climbing delivery from low altitude (Figure D-13) employed to
achieve some degree of standoff with low drag weapons. After bomb
release, a hard descending turn is accomplished to get back to low altitude
and avoid overflight of the target and weapon frag. Targets may be
designated by any means; however, for pull-up deliveries, NAV, radar, and
IR are the most likely designation modes. Once A/G master mode is
selected, the HUD displays symbology for the selected delivery mode. At
designation, the CC begins computing bomb range, range to the target,
and displays attack steering.

CC calculations are done in two separate phases for a loft delivery. The
first phase begins at designation and ends at two seconds TREL. This is
the projected ballistics phase. The second phase, beginning at two seconds
TREL, and lasting until release, is called the instantaneous ballistics
phase.

Figure D - 13. LOFT.

Approach

The approach to the target may be from virtually any altitude or heading.
Normally, the approach is from very low altitude. After designating a
target and going to A/G master mode, azimuth steering is available via
the command heading bug and the ASL. In addition to range, the CC also
computes the time to reach the pull-up point and displays it as TPULL in
the HUD data block if the target is within 60° of the nose. At five seconds
TPULL an elevation steering line appears.

The projected ballistics phase assumes the aircraft speed and altitude will
be the same at TPULL = 0 as they are during the run-in. Assuming a
constant power pull (MIL power) and deceleration during the climb, the
CC projects the effect of pulling up at 4 Gs to the programmed loft angle.
This yields a bomb range and TOF, TPULL and bomb trajectory to fine
tune the max loft angle for present and projected conditions.

Pull-up

At TPULL =0, the ESL programs a 2 Gs/second buildup (Figure D-14) to
4 Gs in order to release at the desired loft angle. If the ESL is followed,
release occurs with G on the aircraft.

AGD-5 D - 28


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_35.jpeg:
The instantaneous ballistics phase uses feedback from the current aircraft
load factor to calculate an elevation steering error. If the pilot is
underpulling, the ESL is placed higher on the HUD. If the pilot overpulls
the steering, the ESL is positioned lower to achieve the programmed
parameters.

The bomb is released when instantaneous ballistics indicate the selected
weapon will hit the target. This may not coincide with programmed
parameters, and may occur before the selected parameters are achieved.
The overriding concern is to get the bomb on target.

Tracking

Tracking is a matter of following both the ESL and ASL until bomb
release. This means placing the velocity vector over the steering lines.
The ASL, in particular, is quite sensitive, and it may be easier to follow
the command steering on the HUD or HSI initially. Once the velocity
vector is on or near the ASL, transition to it for steering. With the
steering properly aligned, the TD diamond is still over the target, the ASL
steers you to a point upwind from the target, and the aircraft is crabbed
into the wind.

D - 29 AGD-5


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_36.jpeg:
Release

At 15 seconds TREL the radar is pointed at the designated target and A/G
ranging begins automatically if AUTO or AGR is the priority sensor and a
NAV or radar designation is used. If TPULL is being computed, the CC
predicts TREL based on TPULL pull-up maneuver time, and automatic
A/G ranging occurs when the predicted TREL is equal to 15 seconds. (For
a BDU-33 max range loft, this occurs at about 8 seconds TPULL.) This is
verified by the appearance of a range bar in the reticle which indicates
slant range to the target. At 10 seconds TREL, the release cue appears on
the ASL above the velocity vector. When it reaches the velocity vector, the
CC generates a release pulse; and, if the pickle button is being held down,
the bomb is released (Figure D-15). Before the release cue reaches the
velocity vector, you should check the pull-up cue to be sure it is below your
velocity vector. This ensures you will clear the weapon frag and allow
time to arm the fuzes. Release is inhibited if the velocity vector is not
within 20° of the ASL or if pickle occurred inside of release range. When
the last release pulse is generated, the reticle flashes and TREL changes
to TIMPCT unless a nuclear bomb was released. If a nuke was released,
TREL changes to TBURST.

Error Analysis

Two conditions may result in not achieving the desired/max range loft
programmed. One is underpulling (lagging the ESL), and the second is
increasing thrust at zero TPULL or during the pull-up. Both result in
placing the aircraft closer to the target than projected when the desired
loft angle is achieved, either of which would result in a long bomb. So an
early release must occur to hit the target.

Overpulling is a set of conditions where the bomb would fall short if
released at the max loft angle. This results from the max loft angle being
achieved further up range from the target than the projected point. The
bomb may not be released. This no release condition may be corrected by
bunting the aircraft over or significantly easing off on the pull until
release occurs.

Egress

After the bombs are released, roll to 135° of bank and pull the nose back
down below the horizon. After about 135° of turn, the target is behind you
and you should roll out to generate maximum separation from weapon
effects.

Reattack

Whether bombs are released or not, as long as the target remains
designated and A/G master mode remains selected, steering continues to
the target. This allows the crew to have immediate steering back to the
target in the event a reattack is required. The ASL is stuck to one side or
the other of the HUD and the TD diamond is removed. When the airplane
is once again turned toward the target and the target is within 60° of the
nose, the TD diamond returns. When the attack is complete, select the
NAV master mode or undesignate and the steering should auto-sequence
to the next steer point (if auto-sequencing is enabled).

Level
The level attack profile provides an accurate means to lay down ordnance

in all types of weather. As far as displays are concerned, the level attack
is very similar to the LOFT attack (Figure D-16).

Approach

The approach to the target may be from any altitude or direction. The
attack steering is based on present position direct to the target or via a
crew selected attack heading if pattern steering is designated. As with the
LOFT attack, once the target is designated, command heading on the
HUD and HSI is the heading to fly in order to reach the wind-corrected
release point (Figure D-17). Once the gross steering corrections are made,
keep the velocity vector centered on the ASL. If 0° is the selected loft
angle, TPULL and the ESL are not displayed and TREL is displayed on
the HUD. Elevation steering is inhibited for those weapons that are
programmed for non-LOFT delivery profiles, such as high drag bombs and
AGMs; otherwise if a LOFT angle is programmed, then HUD cues for a
LOFT delivery will initially be displayed. At five seconds TPULL the ESL
appears, but in this case, do not follow it when it begins to program up.
After five seconds, the ESL is removed from the HUD if the elevation
steering is not followed.

If a loft angle other than 0° is selected for a level delivery, expect a delay
in the TREL computation and a possible jump in the ASL as the CC
compensates for the change in release conditions when the ESL is
removed. It is very important to be mindful of weapon frag in this mode.

Tracking

The primary task in tracking the target is to keep the velocity vector
centered on the ASL. At 15 seconds TREL, the radar automatically goes
to the air-to-ground ranging mode (depending on the designation source
and priority sensor). Ranging is pointed through the TD diamond. The
crew should look for the presence of the release cue and TREL to know
when they are within the 20° cone and should also be aware of the time
remaining to release to know when to concentrate their effort to zero out
any steering error. If the steering error is greater than 20°, the release
cue and TREL are not displayed on the HUD and weapon release is
inhibited.

It is also extremely important at this time to check the pull-up cue to be

sure it is below the velocity vector. Weapon release is not inhibited by
values of pull-up or ground clearance.

Release

The pickle button may be depressed anytime after the target is
designated. At 10 seconds TREL, the release cue appears and begins to
track down toward the velocity vector (Figure D-18). When the release
cue reaches the velocity vector, release occurs if the pickle button is being
held down. When the last bomb is released, the reticle flashes and TREL
changes to TIMPCT, TTGT or TBURST depending on the type weapon
released.

The release pulse is inhibited in the AUTO mode if the pickle button is
pressed after the center of the pattern is past.

After release, fly the safe escape maneuver used in planning the delivery.
Failure to do so will increase the potential for frag damage.

Reattack
Target designation and attack steering is retained for purposes of reattack
until the master mode is changed from A/G or the target is undesignated

(auto-sequencing enabled). If auto-sequencing is disabled, steering to
target is retained regardless of master mode or designation status.

Diving

The diving attack using the AUTO mode may be accomplished with or
without a predesignated target. All the cockpit indications are virtually
the same.

Designated

If a target is designated by radar or some other means, the attack can be
accomplished like any other type of diving attack; the velocity vector is
placed over an aim-off point and dive angle is maintained until bomb
release (Figure D-19).

DESIGNATE RELEASE

AGD-05-19

Figure D - 19. AUTO Dive (Designated).

Once the target is designated, by whatever means, the dive angle need no
longer be maintained. With the velocity vector/reticle centered on the
ASL, a 2-4 G pull can be initiated. The CC releases the weapon at the
proper range to hit the target. With the proper planning, this occurs near
level flight. Once the weapon is released, the desired escape maneuver
can be performed. This entire delivery process is called a long range dive
toss (LRDT).

AGD-5 D - 36


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_43.jpeg:
Approach: The approach to the target is like any other dive attack. You
must get into a position from which you can acquire the target and deliver
ordnance and recover by minimum altitude for ground and frag clearance.

Tracking: Tracking depends somewhat on whether the target is
designated before or after the dive begins. If the target is designated
before the dive, tracking amounts to rolling out on final with the velocity
vector centered on the ASL and pressing the pickle button (Figure D-20).

By virtue of having to put the velocity vector/pipper on the target to

mean shallowing the dive angle by tracking the aim-off point after
designation for a diving delivery or initiating a 2-4 G pull for a dive toss
delivery.

steering is used. When available, the PSL attempts to provide alignment
for wings level steering on the PSL selected heading for the last 15
seconds of the attack. The ASL returns at 15 seconds TREL (or when the

Crew Coordination

For an AUTO attack, the WSO is primarily interested in designating the
target through the best means available while the pilot is primarily
concerned with flying the attack profile. The pilot selects A/G master
mode and turns the master arm on. The WSO checks the PACS for proper
programming and a RDY indication. If required, he turns the VTRS on.
Once the WSO gets his final designation with the A/G radar and has
cleared the target area with the A/A radar, he may tell the pilot to take
command of the HUD. If the pilot sees the target approaching and the
WSO has not cleared him to take command, he advises the WSO and then
takes command, if required.

If the WSO is using the targeting IR and plans on redesignating the
target, he informs the pilot because of possible jumps in the ASL. The
pilot evaluates the WSO’s designation through the HUD, if able, and must
be ready to make a visual designation, if required, or make azimuth
corrections as necessary. At approximately five seconds TREL (for other
than visual designations) the pilot pushes down on the pickle button to
give release consent. After release he flies the planned safe escape
maneuver while the WSO clears the area visually and/or with the radar.

Error Analysis
Probably the most significant questions to answer are whether the TD
diamond was over the target and the velocity vector over the ASL at

release.

Steering Error

If the velocity vector was not over the ASL at release, the next question is
why not. If it was because of late designation, attempt to designate
earlier. If it was due to control technique, try using the command heading
for gross heading changes then the ASL for final small corrections. An
error in following the ESL should not normally cause a bomb range error,
simply a change in the release point.

AGD-5 D - 42


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_49.jpeg:
System Error

If the TD diamond was over the target with the velocity vector glued to
the ASL and the bomb still did not hit the target, the system has an error.
If EGI (after TCTO 1F-15E-737) is installed and EGI is the PPKS, check
to see if it has stopped tracking satellites. The EGI present position and
SYSG inputs should remain usable for short periods. Select INS or MN
PPKS for SYSB after longer periods of lost track. FNU INS and MN
information will become more accurate.

Before TCTO 1F-15E-737 or if INS or MN is the PPKS, check the INS and
MN for a velocity or altitude error and update as necessary. The mission
navigator should be updated as close to designation as possible. If there is
no appreciable MN or INS error some other system aiming error is likely
the culprit. If you are satisfied the error is constant and predictable,
compensate by adjusting the designation, if possible or adjusting the along
track and/or cross track values on the A/G DLVRY format.

A/G Event Data

On the range, A/G events may be reviewed on downwind. The crew can
review delivery parameters including steering deviations. CTBE gives the
distance from the ASL at release and is valuable in determining auto
steering errors.

CDIP
CDIP Mode Description

The CDIP mode uses the same set of equations as AUTO to compute bomb
range and TOF. The main difference between the modes is in the display.

In CDIP, the current bomb range is used to determine the position of the
pipper. The pipper contained in the reticle is an aiming index. Pickle
always designates the point behind the pipper as a target in CDIP even if
a previous designation existed at pickle. If the pipper position becomes
HUD limited, the reticle is displayed at the HUD limit along with the time
to release to cause the bomb to impact at the spot on the ground under the
pipper. This is called a saturated HUD. A saturated HUD is referred to
as having “time in the sight.”

Because CDIP displays are normally for instantaneous release on the
pickle point, climbing/loft maneuvers are not feasible. Toss deliveries are
possible under conditions where the reticle is saturated; i.e., HUD limited.

Equipment (86-0183 through 92-0366 before TCTO 1F-15E-737,
Embedded GPS/INS)

In order to effectively use the CDIP mode, the CC, MPDP, HUD,
MPD/MPCD, PACS, ADC, and FNU INS or AHRS must be functional.

Central Computer (CC)

Unlike AUTO where weapon impact point computation begins with target
designation, the CC begins impact point computations when CDIP is
selected.

Display Processor

The MPDP is the device which creates all the symbology for display on the
HUD and MPD.

AGD-5 D - 46


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_53.jpeg:
HUD

The HUD is the device which presents the steering information and other
delivery cues to the pilot.

Multipurpose Display

A MPD/MPCD is needed to gain access to the PACS. It may also be used
to obtain steering information from a HSI or ADI.

Information pertinent to a CDIP delivery is presented on the HUD and a
MPD (ARMT and A/G DLVRY displays). A limited amount of steering
information is available on the HSI and ADI. Unlike AUTO, without the
HUD, you do not have enough information to complete the attack.

PACS

The PACS is used to build the delivery program. A CDIP program may be
set up to include the stations, sequencing options, and fuzing options.
AUTO display symbology as a result of a designation with an AUTO
PACS program may be changed to CDIP symbology via HOTAS.

Air Data Computer

The ADC deposits data into the CC data base for use by the A/G module.
Some of the information is required for the ballistics computations. Other
information is used if the mission NAV determines that information is the
best source.

Attitude Reference
The INS and AHRS also deposit information into the CC data base to be

used as required by the mission NAV and the A/G module. Essentially,
attitude, velocity, and acceleration data are provided.

D - 47 AGD-5


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_54.jpeg:
Equipment (96-0200 and up or after TCTO 1F-15E-737, Embedded
GPS/INS)

The central computer, multipurpose display processor, head-up display,
multipurpose display/color display and programmable armament control
set remain essentially the same. However, the air data computer and
reference system have changed.

Air Data Processor (ADP)

The air data computer has been replaced by the ADP. This change is
transparent to the operator. The system altitude is present position
keeping source (PPKS) selection dependent. With the EGI as the PPKS
EGI altitude outputs are taken into the position/velocity consistency
(PVC) filter into the CC. This filter uses EGI blended altitude and
blended vertical velocity to produce the system altitude (SYSG) which
provides stable and consistent data for weapons delivery computations.
For any PPKS other than EGI the system altitude (SYSB) is the
temperature corrected pressure altitude aided by FNU INS velocities.

Reference System
With the EGI selected as the PPKS EGI position and velocities are also
used for the weapons delivery computations. The FNU INS provides the

primary attitude, heading, attitude rates and accelerations.

Switches and Controls

There are many switches involved in setting up the CDIP delivery mode.
Many of the switches, those associated with the PACS primarily, can be
programmed using the DTM or set before takeoff. Additionally, there are
two ways to enter the CDIP mode.

A/G Master Mode

The A/G master mode enables the bomb release circuits. Additionally, it
permits air-to-ground symbology to be displayed on the HUD.

AGD-5 D - 48


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_55.jpeg:
FCP Castle Switch

This switch is used to take command of the HUD. Command is required
to get AGR in the PACS CDIP mode and to permit auto acq switching to
the CDIP mode from PACS AUTO mode.

MPD/MPCD

The MPD and its push buttons are your means to set up a CDIP or AUTO
program, select armament, and select sequencing and fuzing options. A/G
DLVRY inputs will adjust the CC aim point just as in AUTO as well as
allow sensor selection and pull-up cue condition inputs.

Master Arm Switch

The master arm must be placed in ARM to enable the release circuits,
obtain a PACS ready, and provide a gun cross and mode indicator on the
HUD.

Pickle Button

The pickle button normally initiates release. Additionally, it always
designates a target at the current pipper position in CDIP.

Release Programming

Full PACS release sequencing is available. Simply establish a CDIP or
AUTO program and select the desired release options. For ripple
programs, the CC computes for the center point of the string by default.
Minimum release interval considerations are the same as for AUTO.

D - 49 AGD-5


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_56.jpeg:
Armament

You can bring up an ARMT display (Figure D-26) on any MPD/MPCD.
You must have a CDIP or AUTO program selected with at least one
loaded station boxed. You must also have a RDY indication next to

PB #11. Remember, once you have a program established, you can change
parameters such as quantity, interval, or fuze options at will.

CDIP Delivery Symbology

The HUD (Figure D-27) displays a 50 mil reticle with the 2 mil pipper (or
a 25 mil reticle with a 1 mil pipper) at the predicted bomb impact point.
The reticle is connected to the velocity vector by a displayed impact line
(DIL). The reticle may contain a range bar if the pilot takes command of
the HUD and LAS or AGR is available.

Figure D - 27. HUD - CDIP Symbology.

The computer calculates and displays a DIL to aid the pilot in flying a
course line projected through the target. The pilot steers so the target
appears to move along the DIL towards the reticle and applies the release
signal when the pipper crosses the target. The release signal designates
the target and initializes the AUTO display.

The computations of weapon ballistics and the HUD reticle position are
started when the CDIP mode is selected. Selection may be from a CDIP or
AUTO PACS program. If a CDIP program is used, the legend in the lower
right corner reads CDIP and tells which sensor is being used for HAT
computations. If CDIP is entered from AUTO (by taking command of the
HUD and thumbing aft on the FCP auto acq switch), the legend reads
AUTO but the rest of the symbology is obviously CDIP until pickle.

D-51 AGD-5


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_58.jpeg:
If the impact point is outside the HUD field of view, the reticle is
displayed at the HUD limit along with a time to release (TREL), and the
point under the pipper is still the predicted impact point. Because the
computed impact point for the bomb range would occur under the nose,
the pipper is positioned on the HUD to show where the bombs will
eventually hit if the pickle button is pressed right now (designation). An
AUTO symbology is displayed until multiple or delayed releases are
complete.

Displayed Impact Line (DIL)

The DIL provides an azimuth steering reference to aid in positioning the
reticle on the target. It is limited to the edge of the reticle to allow clearer
viewing of objects in the reticle.

When the pickle button is pressed, the CDIP display is terminated until

the pickle button is released. The AUTO delivery display is used while
the pickle button is held, including all HUD symbols.

AGD-5 D - 52


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_59.jpeg:
CDIP Deliveries

CDIP is the primary visual delivery mode. It can be employed with or
without a target designation prior to the final attack. The point under the
pipper is always designated the target at pickle. At pickle, the display
looks just like AUTO until the pickle button is released.

Climbing

While a climbing attack is possible from CDIP, it is not the normal profile.
In the event the reticle is HUD limited and a TREL is displayed, it is
possible to place the pipper on the target, press the pickle button, and
begin a pull-up. Due to the ranges involved, this should result in a very
quick release.

Level

The level attack is normally conducted from low altitude but can be
accomplished from any altitude (Figure D-28). If the HUD reticle is
displayed at the HUD limit, TREL is displayed in the data block and is
your only clue that release will be delayed. Designation is not required
prior to final attack but may aid in target acquisition.

Approach

Depending on the type target, the approach to the target may be at very
low altitude with a climb to delivery altitude just prior to release. If the
target is such that detection is very difficult, it may be necessary to climb
slightly to acquire the target and deliver in a very shallow dive.
Cross-check the pull-up cue and be sure you are above the weapon frag.

A prior designation may enhance the pilot’s visual acquisition of the
target. A target designation may also be used to stabilize the CDIP
reticle. When there is no target designated, target altitude is computed
from laser range, AGR, SYSG (96-0200 and up or after TCTO 1F-15E-737,
EGI), radar altimeter, or system barometric (SYSB) altitude. Terrain
altitude variation is continuously used in computing the impact point.
Rough or hilly terrain results in a changing CDIP display. When a target
is designated the vertical component relative to the target is used to
compute bomb range and position the pipper. This results in a stabilized
display.

Tracking

Tracking is by visual means until a target is designated. You should
maneuver the airplane to place the DIL over the target and allow the
target to move down the DIL to the pipper (Figure D-29). If a target is
designated by some means other than the pipper, command heading is
available and the TD diamond marks the target.

If the CDIP reticle had been HUD limited at pickle, TREL is displayed,
and bomb release does not occur until TREL 0:00. While the pickle button
is held down, the AUTO display provides wind-corrected steering for the

Reattack

The designation is held by the CC to help relocate the target should a
reattack be necessary. Command heading is available on the HUD and
HSI. The TD diamond is also present when the target is once again in the
HUD field of view. Depending on the pickle button, station loading, and
PACS programming, an ASL may be available to aid in reattack steering.

Diving

The diving attack is readily accomplished using CDIP (Figure D-32). You
must fly your airplane to a position from which you can roll in, track,
pickle, and recover without hitting the ground or the weapon frag. This is
the same thing you do for a noncomputed delivery. The computer simply
refines your accuracy.

Approach

The approach is from any altitude as dictated by the threat. Steering is to
the current steer point which may or may not be a target. The approach
has all the flexibility of any other diving attack. Once rollout is
accomplished with the velocity vector on the aim-off point, attempt to
maintain a constant dive angle until release (Figure D-33).

Tracking

At rollout, the target is between the pipper and the velocity vector.
Whether the target is closer to the pipper or closer to the velocity vector
depends on dive angle, track time, and ordnance ballistics. These are the
same things that determine IPP (initial pipper placement) for manual dive
bomb. Tracking consists of maintaining the velocity vector on the aim-off
point and killing target drift. Drift is nulled by flying the airplane to place
the DIL over the target. As altitude decreases during the dive, the DIL
shortens and the target appears to track along the DIL to the pipper.
When the pipper is superimposed over the target, press the pickle button.
The HUD display changes to an AUTO display until the pickle button is
released.

Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_66.jpeg:
Crew Coordination

During the CDIP attack, the pilot is concerned with visually navigating to
and acquiring the target. How much coordination is required before going
to CDIP depends to some extent on how CDIP is entered. If entered from
AUTO, the pilot must take command of the HUD, which also takes the
radar to AGR. A second act of taking command of the HUD points the
targeting pod through the CDIP pipper.

If CDIP is entered through a PACS program, the radar and IR are
available to the WSO until the pilot takes command of the HUD to get
AGR.

In any event, if the pilot wants to use the radar designation to help locate
the target during a CDIP pass, he must wait until the WSO has at least
frozen a usable map prior to taking command of the HUD or use some
other means of designation.

Error Analysis

As in all error analysis, you must first answer the question of where the
pipper was at pickle. If not on the target, put it there the next pass. If
you made a lateral error, attempt to get the DIL over the target as soon as
possible. If the DIL is not over the target as you approach pickle, it is fair
to use a small amount of bank to put it there. If the error was in range,
ask yourself if you held a constant dive angle through the pass. If you pull
the pipper up to the target, range accuracy is degraded because of CC
solution time.

If you do not have command of the HUD during a CDIP pass, neither
radar nor laser range is available. If this is the case, IN CMD is not
displayed, and there is no range bar in the reticle. If you significantly
deviate from planned parameters, the CC still solves the bombing problem
but possibly at the expense of frag and/or ground clearance.

TEXT
CENTRAL COMPUTER A/G PROCESSING
A/G Module

In the F-15E, all air-to-ground weapon release computations are
accomplished by the A/G module (Figure D-1) in the central computer
(CC). Within the CC, the A/G module interacts with the navigation
(NAV), flight director (FD), and controls and displays (C&D) software
modules and data bases. These modules, in turn, pass information to and
from other avionics systems.

The A/G module functions only when the A/G master mode is selected and
uses a generic set of ballistics equations to compute weapon time of fall
and range. These computations include rack characteristics and specific
weapon characteristics stored in the PACS. The CC compensates for CFT
station location and weapon lateral departure angle. If a ripple release
program is set, default computations and steering information are for the
string center point. The aircrew may request an aim point to select a
specific bomb to hit the target. Wind, coriolis, and separation effects are
accounted for by adjusting the steering aim point for the computed miss
distance. Wind is factored into the CC ballistics calculations based on a
wind model.

A/G PACS Modes

The same ballistics equations are used regardless of release mode; the
presentation in the cockpit is what is different. Weapon release cockpit
displays are a function of the release mode choice. Delivery steering,
timing, and range cues may be optimized for weapon type, target type,
and designation characteristics.

If a loaded station is not selected on the PACS ARMT display, no steering
is available except NAV steering.

Regardless of the determined PACS mode, if a station with a guided
weapon loaded is selected, the CC is set to the GUIDED mode. For
conventional weapons, if the PACS mode is AUTO, the CC may be set to
AUTO or CDIP. The AUTO low altitude drogue delivery (LADD) option is
also available with a retarded nuclear weapon selected.

AUTO delivery symbology allows weapon delivery in a nonvisual
environment. The continuously displayed impact point (CDIP) mode
allows the pilot to deliver ordnance by visually positioning an aiming
index on the target.

An AUTO PACS program allows the flexibility of switching the display
between AUTO and CDIP via HOTAS. While in command of the HUD
with an AUTO PACS program, the pilot selects AUTO ACQ AFT to switch
to the CDIP aiming index. Subsequent aft selections toggle the display
symbology.

If CDIP is the PACS mode with no loaded stations selected, and AUTO
ACQ AFT is selected while in command of the HUD, the CC is set to CDIP
GUN.

AUTO

Auto Mode Description

The AUTO mode is the basic computed delivery mode of the F-15E. It

provides a means to deliver ordnance accurately with little or no visual
reference to the target.

AGD-5 D-2


Text from AGD-5_Computed_Bombing_Modes_page_9.jpeg:
At target designation, the CC determines the absolute position of the
target based on the aircraft actual position and target relative position
and begins to compute weapon impact position. The relative bomb impact
point is corrected for ballistics, wind, coriolis, and rack delays. Bomb
range is compared to the existing range to the target, and when the two
ranges are equal, weapons release occurs if the aircrew consents to it.

Equipment (86-0183 through 92-0366 before TCTO 1F-15E-737,
Embedded GPS/INS)

In order to effectively use the AUTO mode, the CC, MPDP, HUD,
MPD/MPCD, PACS, ADC, and FNU INS or AHRS must be functional.

Central Computer (CC)

The CC is the key element of the computed modes. It actually works the
bombing problem through the A/G module, and generates the release
signal. If the CC fails, computed deliveries are not available. Cockpit
indications are based on the selected delivery mode.

Multipurpose Display Processor (MPDP)

The MPDP creates all the symbology for display on the HUD and
MPD/MPCD.

Head-up Display (HUD)

The HUD presents the steering information and other delivery cues to the
pilot.

Multipurpose Display / Multipurpose Color Display (MPD /MPCD)

An MPD/MPCD provides access to program and monitor the PACS and
A/G delivery (DLVRY) program format. It may also be used to display an
HSI or ADI to obtain backup steering information.

Programmable Armament Control Set (PACS)
The PACS provides the CC an interface with the weapons. It is used to
help build the delivery program. An AUTO program includes station

selections, sequencing options (quantity/interval/bomb-on-target), and
fuzing/drag options.

MANUAL GUN

The MANUAL GUN mode for A/G strafe provides a backup capability
(aiming reference) when the CC or PACS has failed or the CDIP reticle is
not functioning properly. The following switches and actions are required.

A/G Master Mode: The A/G master mode enables the bombing circuitry
and must be selected to obtain an A/G sight. (Selecting a MANUAL
position with the selective jettison knob automatically selects the A/G
master mode).

Selective Jettison Knob: To obtain a fixed depressible sight for A/G strafe,
select MANUAL delivery mode (MAN FF or MAN RET) on the ACP, with
either SRM or MRM selected on the weapons select switch (not GUNS).

FCP MPCD: When the selective jettison knob is moved to a manual
release mode, the FCP MPCD reverts to a manual PACS display

(Figure D-4). The previously selected gun rate of fire is used. The PACS
selected bullet type is of no consideration.

Strafe

Due to its upward cant, the gun system of the F-15E is not optimized for
A/G strafe. For a gun canted at or below the velocity vector, the pipper
moves toward the velocity vector from below as range decreases. For a
gun canted above the velocity vector, the pipper moves toward the velocity
vector from below only at very long range. At employment range, the
pipper moves above and away from the velocity vector. Finally, at shorter
ranges, the pipper moves toward the velocity vector from above

(Figure D-8). At effective strafe ranges, the velocity vector is short of the
target. This situation can result in very low pullouts. The more shallow
the dive angle, the more severe the problem. Strafe angles of less than
about 15° are uncomfortable.

AGD-06-08

Figure D - 8. Pipper Versus Flight Path.

Approach

The target may be approached from virtually any altitude or heading. It
is not necessary to designate the target but a TD diamond and command
heading may help in locating an obscure target. You must fly the airplane
to a position from which you can achieve your planned dive angle with
your velocity vector short of the target at the aim-off distance (Figure D-9)
and the pipper above the velocity vector (Figure D-10).

Tracking and Firing

As you close on the target with the velocity vector held on the aim-off
point, the pipper moves up toward the target. As the pipper reaches the
target, hold it there momentarily and squeeze the trigger. Continue to
hold the pipper on the target while firing (Figure D-11). For consistent
results, maintain planned airspeed and fire at the appropriate range. If
the rudder is used while strafing, the bullets will move approximately 80%
of the rudder input. Firing ranges for 30° strafe are approximately
7000-8000 feet slant range, and approximately 8000-9000 feet for 20°
strafe. Long slant ranges like these are not very effective for 20 mm.
These ranges are based on the M56 bullet. For weapons effect, PGU-28
will move the ranges out 300-500 feet.

Figure D - 11. CDIP GUN Firing (High Angle Strafe).

Frag patterns and ricochet patterns are directly affected by the type of
target. Harder surfaces produce more ricochets, while explosive targets
can produce huge frag patterns. The bullet ricochet pattern to be avoided
is a 500 foot diameter bubble and a +30° cone at 12 o’clock to the target.
The chances of a bullet ricochet hitting your jet go up as you fly 12 o’clock
to the target.

D-11 AGD-6


Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_18.jpeg:
Egress/Reattack

A good aggressive pulloff (5 Gs in 2 seconds) is required to avoid bullet
ricochets. It is important to pull the nose well above the horizon (20°)
even if you intend to egress at low altitude. Once you have cleared the
ricochet area you can return to low altitude. If a reattack is required,
steering is available if the target had been designated. Squeezing the
trigger does not designate a target.

Malfunctions
Failure to Fire

Check the master arm switch and RCP circuit breakers (Gun Trigger
Power, Last Round Power, Master Arm Logic Power). Check that A/G
CMBT and A/A CMBT are selected on the PACS.

Runaway Gun

In the event of uncommanded firing or failure to stop firing, point the gun
in the safest direction while turning off the master arm switch. Safe the
gun and do not attempt to fire the gun again.

Jammed Gun

WARNING

Unscheduled gun stoppage during firing
constitutes a possible hazardous condition
and is cause to terminate gun operation
for remainder of the flight. Stoppages can
be caused by malfunctions such as
rupture of round cartridge cases and
consequent dispersal of gun powder in the
gun compartment. Further operation of
the gun after a stoppage could make a
hazardous condition worse or cause a
minor problem to develop into a
hazardous condition.

AGD-6 D-12


Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_19.jpeg:
PACS/Mux Bus Failure

If the BIT page reveals a PACS mux bus code; i.e., PACS 2A, attempt to
clear by a CC mux bus clear (from the BIT MAINT AUDIT display), PACS
recycle and/or CC reset. An uncleared mux bus fault may inhibit selecting
an A/G CDIP GUN sight.

Will Not Safe

With the master arm in SAFE, if the HUD displays rounds remaining,
rather than XXX and/or a gun cross, assume the gun is armed. Do not
turn the master arm switch to ARM unless planning to fire the gun. Pull
the previously mentioned RCP circuit breakers and select A/A TRNG and
A/G TRNG on the PACS. Obviously, avoid the FCP trigger.

WARNING

If the HUD gun cross remains visible
after selecting master arm SAFE, the
weapon release button and trigger
circuits are ARMED.

NONCOMPUTED DELIVERY MODES

You will not often have the opportunity or the desire to use the
noncomputed bombing modes in the F-15E. The computed system
reliability is such that failure of the computed modes is rare. Further,
with the exception of PACS or CC failure, most failures which would
compromise the computed modes will also negate the manual modes.

The noncomputed modes available to you for bomb delivery are DIRECT
and MANUAL. When these modes are employed, the central computer is
not used to generate and display a bombing solution. These noncomputed
modes are backup modes, not alternate modes; they are incorporated to
provide a means for you to release armed munitions in the event you
suffer a PACS and/or CC failure in, or approaching, the target area. The
DIRECT mode provides the capability to practice “manual” bombing using
a SUU-20.

DIRECT

The primary function of the DIRECT mode is to remove the CC generated
ballistics from the bombing solution, so that you can practice “manual
bombing.” The reticle is commanded to be displayed in a fixed position as
set on the program page of the A/G delivery display. Bomb release occurs
as soon as the pickle button is depressed. The pilot must achieve
preplanned parameters associated with the mil setting for a valid solution
to exist. This mode is available only with the SUU-20 bomb dispenser or
GBU-24/28 selected on the PACS.

Required Equipment

In order to have the DIRECT mode available, the following equipment
must be functional: CC, MPDP, PACS, and at least one MPD/MPCD. To
be able to achieve parameters, the HUD, ADC/ADP and INS or EGI must
also be functional.

Although the CC does not generate the bombing solution, it commands the
reticle to be displayed at the entered depression angle. The reticle is
created within the MPDP and displayed on the HUD. In short, it takes a
lot of equipment just to have a reticle as an aiming device.

An MPD/MPCD is required to program the PACS for a direct delivery and
to select ordnance and release sequencing.

D-17 AGD-6


Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_24.jpeg:
Required delivery parameters include airspeed, altitude, angle of attack,
and delivery angle. The ADC/ADP is needed to have accurate airspeed
and altitude information. The INS/EGI is your source of attitude
information.

So, if all the above mentioned equipment is working, you have an aiming
device, a way to select the DIRECT mode, and a way to determine delivery

parameters.

Switches/Controls

The following is a look at the switches and actions involved in setting up
the DIRECT mode.

A/G Master Mode: The A/G master mode enables the bombing circuitry
and must be selected to release air-to-ground ordnance in any delivery
mode.

MPD/MPCD: You must use an MPD/MPCD to program the PACS. You
must set up a DIRECT program (SUU-20 or GBU-24/28 only) to include
ordnance stations and desired release sequencing.

A/G Delivery Display: Mils can be input only through the A/G delivery
display, adjacent to PB #2. To change the mil setting, enter the desired
value (0 to 250) into the UFC scratchpad and depress PB #2. The new
value is sent to the CC.

Master Arm Switch: The master arm must be placed to ARM to enable
the release circuits and obtain a PACS RDY.

Pickle Button: The last step to initiate a release is to depress the pickle
button on either cockpit control stick.

Release Programming

Full PACS capability must exist to have DIRECT available. Establish a
DIRECT program. For the SUU-20 only, if DIRECT is selected, the STEP
release sequence is automatically selected. 1/STA, RPL SGL and RPL
MPL are unavailable if DIRECT is selected with a SUU-20.

AGD-6 D-18


Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_25.jpeg:
Displays

To use the DIRECT bombing mode, you need an armament display on an
MPD/MPCD, the UFC, and the HUD.

Armament: You can bring up an ARMT display (Figure D-12) on any
MPD/MPCD. You must have a DIRECT program selected with at least
one SUU-20, GBU-24, or GBU-28 loaded station boxed. If the pilot is in
command of the HUD during GBU-24/28 operations, pulling aft on the
auto acq switch cycles between AUTO and DIRECT delivery modes. You
must also have a RDY indication next to PB #11 which indicates the
master arm is in ARM and the PACS is ready.

HUD: The HUD (Figure D-14) displays the reticle at the selected
depression angle. This is an “iron” sight and does not move on the HUD;
it is just like any other fixed depressible sight you may have used.
“DIRECT” appears in the lower right corner of the HUD if it is the
selected mode and only if the PACS is ready. Presence of the gun cross is
a further indication the master arm is in ARM. Since the CC is required
to obtain the DIRECT mode, many of the features available in the
computed modes are available—a designated target, LASER ranging, or
AGR, for example. Pickling in DIRECT does not designate the target like
it does in CDIP or undesignated AUTO. However, since the DIRECT
mode simulates using the MANUAL mode with combat ordnance, for a
true simulation you may not want to use features not available when
MANUAL was required because of avionics failures.

Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_28.jpeg:
MANUAL

The primary function of the MANUAL modes is to bypass a failed CC or
PACS. It uses hardwired circuits to the weapons stations. The CC’s
ballistic computations are removed from the bombing solution. The mode
essentially provides a way to release armed ordnance in the event of a
major failure. The reticle is displayed at the depression set on the UFC.
Bomb release occurs as soon as the pickle button is depressed. The pilot
must achieve preplanned parameters associated with the mil setting for a
valid solution to exist. This mode cannot be used to release bombs from a
SUU-20 since the release pulse is sent to the BRU-47 breeches, rather
than the SUU-20. If the BRU-47 was carted (it normally is not with a
SUU-20 loaded), a release pulse would release the SUU-20.

Required Equipment

To enter the MANUAL mode requires only that the selective jettison knob
be rotated to a manual release mode. However, to have a reticle, the
MPDP and HUD must be functional. To be able to achieve parameters,
the ADC/ADP and INS or EGI must also be functional. The UFC is
required to set the mils (assuming you are using MANUAL because the
CC has failed).

Just as in the DIRECT mode, the reticle is displayed at the entered

depression angle. The reticle is created in the MPDP and displayed on the
HUD.

To determine airspeed, altitude, and attitude for release, you need the
ADC/ADP and the INS or EGI.

If the above equipment is functional, you have a way to select the mode,
aim the bomb, and determine delivery parameters.

Switches/Controls

Next is a look at the switches and actions required to set up the MANUAL
mode.

Selective Jettison Knob: This knob, located on the armament control

panel, is rotated to either MAN RET or MAN FF to select the MANUAL
mode.

AGD-6 D - 22


Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_29.jpeg:
A/G Master Mode: The A/G master mode enables the bombing circuitry
and must be selected to release ordnance in any delivery mode. With CC

failure, selectable master modes are unavailable, but selection of
MANUAL also selects the A/G master mode.

FCP MPCD: When the selective jettison knob is moved to one of the MAN
release modes, the FCP MPCD reverts to a MANUAL PACS display and
the top row of pushbuttons (PBs #16-20) are activated. These PBs are
used to select weapons loaded stations.

UFC: With an operative CC, mils can be set on the A/G delivery display
adjacent to PB #2. To change the mil setting, enter the desired value (0 to
250) into the scratchpad and depress PB #2. The new value is shown on
the display and sent to the CC. If the CC fails, the sight depression angle
defaults to 0 mils and the reticle depression angle can be entered on the
UFC backup Menu 2. (The A/G delivery display is unavailable with CC
failure).

Master Arm Switch: The master arm must be placed to ARM to enable
the release circuits.

Pickle Button: To initiate a release, depress and hold the pickle button on
either cockpit control stick. With no way to program the number of bombs
to be released or to monitor the number of bombs actually released, the
pickle button must be held long enough to ensure all selected stations
empty.

Release Programming

Only limited release programming is available in the MANUAL mode and
is obtained by selection of MAN RET or MAN FF.

MAN RET: Weapons stations are as selected on the FCP MPCD. Only
the tail fuze solenoid is activated. Bombs are released in a ripple multiple
mode with one bomb being released from each selected station
simultaneously, until all bombs are released (or the pickle button is
released). The release interval is fixed at a range of 200 to 260 ms (230
Ms nominal).

MAN FF: Weapons stations are as selected on the FCP MPCD. Only the
nose and center fuze solenoids are activated. Bombs are released in a
ripple multiple mode with one bomb being released from each selected
station simultaneously, until all bombs are released (or the pickle button
is released). The release interval is fixed at a range of 60 to 80 ms (70 ms
nominal).

NOTE

If CBU type ordnance is loaded, MAN FF must be selected to get an
armed weapon for canister opening (there is no way to get nose and tail
arming in MANUAL). This will cause the fuzes to function on time

which may result in earlier than desired canister openings. Also,
ripple intervals may be below the minimum interval required in
Section V of the Dash 1.

If the UFC is inoperative with CC failure, weapons can still be released,
but the “iron sight” in the HUD will be displayed at zero setting (with CC
failure, the mil setting defaults to zero). If the HUD is inoperative, no
head-up display will be available, although a HUD repeater may be
available on an MPD/MPCD (not available with CC failure).

Armament: The FCP MPCD automatically reverts toa MANUAL PACS
display (Figure D-15) when the selective jettison knob is rotated to a MAN
position. The display has the word “MANUAL” printed in the center. The
top row of PBs is usable to select weapons stations even if the display
itself is not working. These PBs are internally lighted and are lit if a
station is selected. The FCP MPCD is frozen while in MANUAL and
cannot be changed until the SEL JETT knob is rotated out of the MAN
mode.

Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_32.jpeg:
If any other MPD/MPCD has an ARMT display up when the SEL JETT
knob is rotated to a manual release mode, the display reverts to the basic
display menu and the ARMT option at PB #2 is removed. Since the
ARMIT option is deleted from the display menu, no MPD/MPCD other than
the FCP MPCD can display ARMT information while the SEL JETT knob
is in MAN.

A/G Delivery Display: To check or set sight depression mils (CC
operative), you must be on the A/G delivery display. The currently
selected mil setting is next to PB #2. Use a transfer from the UFC
scratchpad to set the mils.

If the CC fails, the MPDP is used as a backup to provide a UFC. The
sight depression angle defaults to 0 mils, and the reticle depression angle
can be entered on the UFC backup Menu 2 (Figure D-16).

HUD: The HUD (Figure D-17) displays the reticle at the selected
depression angle. This “iron” sight will not float on the HUD and is like
any depressible sight you may have used in the past. The legend
“MANUAL?” appears in the lower right corner of the HUD as soon as the
SEL JETT knob is rotated to a manual release mode. Since this mode
essentially goes around the PACS, the PACS is not checked for a ready
condition and the master arm does not have to be in ARM to get the
legend. There is no pullup (for lofts) cue in MANUAL. If you are using
MANUAL because the CC is inoperative (the normal reason), there is a
gun cross with the master arm in ARM. Ifthe CC is operative but the
PACS is failed, a gun cross may or may not be displayed, depending on the
failure.

TEXT
A/G GUN

The M61A1 gun description and functions are covered in the air-to-air
weapons block of instruction. Preflight procedures for a hot gun are
contained in TO 1F-15E-34-1-1CL-1.

Modes

There are two A/G gun modes: CDIP GUN and MANUAL. With CDIP
GUN selected, the pilot has a computer driven CDIP reticle. The
MANUAL GUN mode, selected from the FCP armament control panel
(ACP), provides a fixed depressible sight, with a manually set reticle
depression. AGR/LAS ranging may be used in either mode, if available.

The A/A gun mode is only marginally useful in A/G strafe. The A/A gun
attack steering only computes a crosswind correction. The wind-corrected
attack steering is only valid when the pipper is stabilized on the target
with the ball centered. Without a lock on, the CC uses a 2250-foot range
and a 50 fps range rate in lead angle computation. Also, in the A/A mode,
A/G slant range (AGR or LAS) presentation is not available.

NOTE

The gun is “hot” in flight in all master modes (A/A, A/G, NAV, INST)
anytime the master arm switch is in ARM (gun cross ON), assuming

the gun is electrically/mechanically armed and both A/A CMBT and
A/G CMBT are selected on the PACS.

Although the gun will not fire unless both A/A and A/G PACS are in the
combat mode (TO 1F-15E-34-1-1), the same document makes several
disclaimers concerning use of the TRNG PACS as a SAFE mode including
that circuit failures can occur which would allow weapon release, even
with TRNG selected. Do not use the A/A and/or A/G TRNG PACS
selection as a gun safing feature.

Text from AGD-6_Strafe_and_Noncomputed_Modes_page_8.jpeg:
Switches and Controls
CDIP GUN
The following switches and actions are required to use CDIP GUN.

A/G Master Mode: The A/G master mode is required to obtain an A/G
sight.

Armament: To employ CDIP GUN you need a CDIP PACS program with
no stations selected. Call up any existing CDIP program and unbox all
the stations. The PACS RDY at PB #11 goes away (Figure D-1). Then,
while in command of the HUD, pull aft on the FCP auto acq switch. This
selects CDIP GUN. If you drop all the bombs on the selected stations
during a CDIP pass, you have effectively unboxed all stations making
CDIP GUN HOTASable. (This includes when the PACS believes the
SUU-20 to be empty and unboxes the station).

Two types of bullets are available for the F-15E. The type and quantity of
bullets are entered on the A/A weapons load page. On all PACS display
formats where rounds count is shown, the count is followed by a “P” for
PGU-28 or “M” for M56. The firing rate, LOW or HIGH, is set on the A/A
PACS employment display.

corrections can be set on the program page of the A/G delivery display by
boxing “PROG PAGE.” LASER range or AGR is available if the AUTO
sensor hierarchy is selected or if LAS and/or AGR is included in the MAN
sensor hierarchy selection. Ranging information on the HUD requires
that the pilot be in command of the sensor (radar/AGR and/or TGT
pod/LAS) through HUD command.

Text from AGD-7_Suspension_Equipment_and_Training_Ordnance_page_11.jpeg:
Suspension Hooks

The suspension and release mechanism is composed of mechanical
linkages and sets of hooks. The hooks on the BRU-46/A are 14 inches
apart. The BRU-47/A is equipped with two sets of hooks. One set is 14
inches apart and the other set is 30 inches apart to accommodate the
larger stores. When a store is loaded, and each hook is locked, a hook
locked visual indicator (a white tab) for each hook is visible through a hole
in the rack. During store release, the mechanical linkages cause the
hooks to open simultaneously to ensure positive store release. The hook
store sensing switch senses whether the hooks are open or closed. When
they are closed, the BRU senses a store is loaded on that station and
relays that through the PACS.

Swaybraces

On each BRU, there are four swaybraces and wedges that provide store
stability during flight. Ensure these are engaged and contact the store
during the preflight.

Ejection Mechanism

Each BRU contains two cartridge breeches and two ejector pistons. When
the cartridges detonate, gas pressure opens the BRU hooks and forces the
ejector pistons down, ejecting the store (employment or jettison).

Arming Mechanism

Arming is provided by three arming units, often referred to as arming
solenoids. During loading, these solenoids accept the weapon fuze arming
wires. When a jettison is required, the arming units release the arming
wires at weapon release, causing ordnance to drop in a safe condition. For
an armed release, the solenoids retain the swivel links at release, pulling
the wire out of the fuze, allowing fuze arming. Arming selections are
made through the PACS. The nose selection activates the center and
forward arming solenoids; tail energizes the aft solenoid.

Pitch Valves

By ensuring BRU-46/A and BRU-47/A pitch valves are set IAW the
Dash 34 checklist (Figure D-4), the crew also ensures optimum separation

Ground Safety Handle

The ground safety handle (Figure D-5) is used to prevent inadvertent
opening of the hooks during ground operations. The ground safety handle
mechanically prevents the opening of the hooks and prevents electrical
current from reaching the impulse carts. In the safe position, the handle
is rotated to the vertical and pushed in. Reflective paint is visible on the
shaft when the handle is extended. The ground safety handle is moved
(rotated counterclockwise to the horizontal position) to the armed position
just prior to flight and pushed back in.

Reversible In-flight Locking (RIFL) Mechanism

The BRU-47/A has a RIFL mechanism. This is a safety and failsafe
provision that is designed to prevent inadvertent opening of the
suspension hooks and firing of the impulse cartridges when a nuclear
weapon is loaded. When the RIFL is in the locked position, the RIFL
locked visual indicator (a white tab) appears through a hole in the rack.
To release (jettison or employ) stores utilizing the conventional PACS, the
RIFL must be in the unlocked condition.

CFT Carriage/Release Sequence

CFT carriage utilizes two rows of BRUs which permit carriage of up to six
1000 pound class weapons or two 2000 pound class weapons or one
nuclear weapon on each CFT (Figure D-6). BRU-46/As are used in the
outboard (shoulder) row and BRU-47/As are used for the inboard (bottom)
row. The tandem carriage arrangement and the deletion of a requirement
for extra bomb racks reduces in-flight drag.

Jettison Procedures

Emergency Jettison (“Panic”) Button

The momentary contact emergency jettison button (Figure D-7), labeled
EMERG JETT, is hot anytime power (including external, main generator,
or emergency generator power) is on the aircraft. Emergency jettison is
operable with the landing gear handle down. The button must be held in
for approximately one second to complete a full load jettison sequence.
Depressing the button releases the carted SUU-59/SUU-73 pylons at
stations 2, 5, and 8, and the stores (bombs/missiles) from all carted CFT
stations. The LANTIRN pods beneath the intakes and the CFTs do not

Selective Jettison Knob/Button

The selective jettison knob is used to select one of several stores release
modes (Figure D-8). The SEL JETT modes are COMBAT, A/A, and A/G.
If the knob is rotated to COMBAT and the button depressed, jettison
occurs as preprogrammed through the PACS. When the knob is rotated to
A/G, all current armament displays and the FCP MPCD change to the A/G
JETTISON display from which desired stores or pylons can be selected for
jettison. If a store is aboard, the display initiates with STORE boxed and
PYLON may be selected (for stations 2, 5, and/or 8). RACK is only used to
jettison LAU-88 or LAU-117 Maverick launchers. Once the desired
stations are selected, depress and hold (until release complete) the button
in the center of the SELECT JETT knob to release all selected stores. All
PACS displays are frozen until the selective jettison knob is rotated out of
SEL JETT; i.e., A/A or A/G. Jettison using any of the selective jettison
capabilities requires main generator power and either the landing gear
handle must be up or the armament safety switch must be in the
OVERRIDE position.

WARNING

Each selection of the CBT JETT display
reinitializes the two-push sequence and
resets the first push of the selective
jettison button to the CBT 1 program,
even if the CBT 1 programmed racks,
stores or pylons have already been
jettisoned.

The combat jettison program is displayed
in TRNG and is reprogrammable for the
TRNG mode display. However, when
CBT JETT is performed, the system exits
TRNG mode and jettisons actual stores
loaded and programmed in the CMBT
mode.

TRAINING ORDNANCE

The F-15E is certified to carry a wide variety of air-to-surface ordnance
suspended from wing/centerline pylons and the CFTs. Throughout the
surface attack phase of your training in FTU, the standard training load
will be a SUU-20 dispenser (loaded with six BDU-33s) on each wing pylon.

SUU-20

The SUU-20 is a practice bomb and rocket dispenser. It can be carried on
the wing or centerline pylons. You need only concern yourself with the
bomb portion of the SUU-20. Rockets are not used in this program and
the intervalometer switch is removed. For a detailed description, refer to
TO 1-1M-34, Section V.

The dispenser has six bomb stations which can be loaded with BDU-33
and/or MK 106 practice bombs. The bombs loaded in the SUU-20 are
identified to the conventional PACS by selecting the proper SUU-20 PACS
ID from the PACS weapons list (Figure D-9, left). Selecting PACS ID
“SUU-20N” identifies a SUU-20 loaded with BDU-33s (blue bombs).
Selecting “SUU-20M” identifies a SUU-20 loaded with MK 106s (orange
bombs). With a mixed load, or in the nuclear PACS, you must select
“SUU-20”, and then identify each bomb in the dispenser (Figure D-9,
right). With the store identified as a SUU-20, the RPL SGL and RPL
MPL release sequencing options are not available. The MK 106 practice
bomb is no longer in the Air Force inventory; however, it is still one of the
options in the PACS.

Major features and preflight items of the SUU-20 dispenser are shown in
Figure D-10.

Bombs are held in place by the bomb retaining arms and stabilized by
swaybraces. Bombs are force ejected by electrically fired pyrotechnic
cartridges. Bomb release sequencing is controlled by an intervalometer
(rotary switch) in the nose of the dispenser. This intervalometer rotates
clockwise only and functions in a step-and-fire fashion. The stepper
switch stops at station 6 and cannot step from 6 to 1. The BOMB RIPPLE
and SALVO positions of the rotary switch are not used in the F-15E.

If a ripple release is desired, load SUU-20N in the PACS and then
program the PACS for a ripple release. Ripple release is not possible
using the SUU-20 PACS identity. Safing of the SUU-20 dispenser is
provided by several means. The intervalometer being in a SAFE position
electrically prevents carts from firing. A safety spring installed in the
lower rear of the dispenser breaks the aircraft-to-SUU electrical circuit.
Individual ejector gun safety pins prevent the retaining arms from
opening should a cart accidentally fire (during ground operations).

Preflight

Ensure the safety spring is installed in the rear of the SUU-20 dispenser
and an ejector gun safety pin is installed in each set of retaining arms.

Ensure the bomb intervalometer is in the SAFE position preceding bomb
single; this is toward the nose of the dispenser.

Ensure all bombs are securely in place.

Preflight procedures for all weapons are contained in TO 1F-15E-34-1-1
and TO 1F-15E-34-1-1CL-1.

When carrying the SUU-20 dispenser at FTU, neither the pylon nor the
BRU-47/A is carted. Therefore, the SUU-20 is not jettisonable. The pylon
safety pin is installed, however, and will be removed by the arming crew
in the arming area. The arming crew also sets the bomb intervalometer to
ARM, removes the retaining arm safety pins, and removes the safety
spring.

The BRU-47/A cartridge indicators are extended if carts are not present.
The pylon breech retainers are safety wired when no carts are installed.
Carts are not installed to prevent inadvertent jettison of the SUU-20.
Additionally, the safety handle should be vertical, which is the SAFE
position.

Ensure the RIFL is unlocked. If locked, the RIFL prevents release of
stores from the BRU-47/A (including bombs from the SUU-20) through the
conventional PACS. Ifthe RIFL is locked, the nuclear PACS must be
used.

Carriage/Kmployment Limits

Maximum allowable airspeed, Mach number, G, and AOA are reduced by
virtue of having a SUU-20 installed on the aircraft. If the PACS is
properly programmed, the OWS generated and displayed allowable G is
still correct for the basic aircraft structure. The OWS, however, is not
programmed with individual stores limits. You must remember these
limits and not exceed them. Check the Dash 1, Section V for the current
SUU-20 limits. E2mpty pylons are cleared to basic aircraft limits.

BDU-33

The BDU-33 (blue bomb) (Figure D-12) is a 24 pound practice bomb that is
used to simulate many different low drag bombs. The bomb normally
contains a signal cartridge about the size of a 10 gauge shotgun shell. The
cart is detonated by impact to provide flash and smoke for spotting/scoring
purposes. This flash is emitted from the tail of the bomb and is
potentially dangerous if the cart is ignited while you are close to the bomb.
During preflight checks, be careful not to push in on the nose plunger.

The safety device between the nose plunger and the bomb body prevents
bomb signal cartridge detonation if the bomb were to fall out of the
SUU-20 on the ground. The weapons load crew removes the safety device
in the chocks after uploading the BDU-33s in the SUU-20. There are also
“cold spot” bombs which emit smoke only (no flash). These bombs are
utilized when range conditions dictate precautions to prevent range fires.
Additionally, the tail fin assembly of the bomb is easily damaged. For a
more detailed description of the bomb, refer to TO 1-1M-34, Section V.

Preflight BDU-33s

Ensure the BDU-33s are secure in their retaining arms by visual
inspection. Do not hit the bombs’ nose firing pins!

Operating Limits

Carriage: BDU-33s loaded into a SUU-20 do not impose any carriage
restrictions over the empty SUU-20. Refer to the Dash 1, Section V for
the current limits.

Employment: Employment G limits are not incorporated into the OWS
program. Additionally, exceeding these limits does not generally inhibit a
release but may result in a bomb-aircraft collision or hung bomb. Current
limits are as shown in the Dash 1, Section V.

Jettison: Jettison of BDU-33s is not possible. If the bombs must be

jettisoned, they must be released normally via the PACS and the bomb
release buttons (pickle buttons).

SUSPENSION EQUIPMENT
Stations

The F-15E is designed to deliver a vast array of conventional weapons. To
do this, there must be a method to attach these munitions to the aircraft
so they are secure until delivery or jettison is desired. The suspension
equipment is designed to provide these capabilities.

The aircraft carries external stores on stations 2, 5, and 8, and the right
and left conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) (Figure D-1). Prior to carrying any
external stores, ensure that you are familiar with the carriage,
employment, and jettison limits from TO 1F-15E-1, Section V, Operating
Limitations.

Text from AGD-7_Suspension_Equipment_and_Training_Ordnance_page_8.jpeg:
Pylons

The F-15E may be equipped with armament pylons on both wing stations
(#2 and #8), and the centerline station (#5). SUU-59 pylons are used on
the wing stations and the SUU-78 pylon is used on the centerline station.
These pylons (Figure D-2) contain a BRU-47/A and other hardware and
electrical wiring to provide the interface between the aircraft and
whatever is suspended from that pylon. The SUU-59 and SUU-73 are
functionally identical; they differ only in shape and size to fit the differing
aerodynamic and structural requirements of the stations they serve. To
permit jettison of the pylon with the stores, each pylon contains two
ejector cartridges, resembling shotgun shells. They provide the force
needed to separate the pylon from the aircraft. The pylons should be
checked each flight when you are carrying any store that may require
jettisoning (the pylons are not carted for most FTU training missions).
Also, ensure that the pylon ejector breech safety pin is installed. During
pylon jettisoning, the pylon is retained by the aft pivot point until an
initial nose-down pitch moment is obtained to ensure safe separation from
the aircraft.

Bomb Release Units (BRUs)

A bomb release unit is an integral part, actually the workhorse, of each
pylon and CFT station. The BRU-46/A is in the outboard CFT stations
and the BRU-47/A is in each pylon and inboard (lower) CFT station
(Figure D-3). These units contain the hardware for stores carriage,
employment and jettison, and tell the aircraft stores are on board. The
BRU-46/A carries stores in the 1000 pound class, while the BRU-47/A
carries the 2000 pound and up class weapons. The BRUs also have
cartridge breeches to provide for release or jettison of stores mounted to
its hooks. The breech caps have cartridge indicators which are flush if
carts are installed and extended if carts are not installed. The hooks are
mechanically locked and the breech carts electrically isolated by the safety
handle. This handle is permanently installed and can be rotated between
SAFE and ARM. Another item on the BRU-47/A is the reversible in-flight
lock (RIFL) which must be unlocked to allow release or jettison of stores
utilizing the conventional (vice nuclear) PACS, including release of bombs
from a SUU-20.

Pulse Length Error (PLE)

All radar transmissions have a definite pulse length which induces errors
in range. PLE is caused by the time difference between the leading and
trailing edges of the pulse striking an object and returning to the radar
(Figure D-3). This error is one-half the actual length of the transmitted
pulse. Thus, for any given pulse, it is always a constant value regardless
of range. PLE adds length to the far side of a reflecting object or it adds
length to the near side of a nonreflecting no-show area (e.g., a lake). PLE
adds error to the entire area of distortion caused by BWE.

D-5 AGR-1


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_12.jpeg:
Range resolution is a function of pulse length. For a radar to resolve
(display separately) two targets in range, their range separation must be
such that the trailing edge of the pulse will have departed the near target
before the leading edge of the echo from the far target returns to the near
target. Thus, two targets must be separated by at least one-half the pulse
length, regardless of target range from the radar, to be displayed
separately.

Although pulse length error (for a given pulse length) is constant
regardless of range from the target, the actual radar pulse length of the
APG-70 varies as you change radar scope ranges. The range resolution
cells for the various radar scope ranges of the F-15E are as follows:

Radar Scope Range Range Resolution

(nm) (feet)

4.7 59

10.0 127

20.0 253

40.0 507

80.0 1014

160.0 2028

One additional constraint on resolution is the digital nature of radar
processing. This constraint applies to both pulsed and doppler radar
processing. No matter how close a target, how narrow a beam, how short
a pulse, or how small a display range or map size, with current processing
capability, the absolute best APG-70 resolution achievable is 8.45 feet (in
the HRM patch map mode).

AGR-1 D-6


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_13.jpeg:
BWE and PLE combine to make the return larger than the target’s true
size (Figure D-4). BWE error is reduced as range to the target decreases.
PLE is constant for a given display range. To minimize the effects of these
errors (again, only present in the RBM radar mode) use the center leading
edge of the radar return as the center of the object, and use the smallest
possible radar display range.

Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_14.jpeg:
Mechanized Resolution Versus Target Breakout

Although beam width and pulse length determine the azimuth and range
resolution cells respectively for a pulse radar, a radar (pulse or doppler) is
frequently unable to display two targets as discrete returns because of
display limitations. If two point targets are separated by the minimum
resolution cell size, the radar display will indicate two adjacent targets,
which will appear as one target to the aircrew. You will have to decrease
your radar scope range or get closer to the targets before they are
displayed separately. As a guide, targets separated by two to three times
the resolution cell size should normally be displayed as discrete targets.

The F-15E radar display is separated into many small picture elements
called “pixels.” More specifically, the display is subdivided into 480 X 480
pixels, or a total of 230,400 picture elements, with each element having a
length and width limitation based on radar range. For example, when
using the 10 nm radar range each pixel equates to an area of 127 square
feet. This means that any object the radar “sees” will be displayed as at
least a 127 X 127 foot return, even if the radar can determine it to be
smaller. This is referred to as mechanical resolution, and it is present in
all modes of the APG-70 radar. See the chart below for pixel size based on
the selected radar display range, or display window size for HRM patch
maps in the F-15E.

Range Scale Pixel Size

(nm) (feet)

4.7 59

10.0 127
20.0 253
40.0 507
80.0 1014
160.0 2028

To recap, RBM resolution is limited by BWE (range to target), PLE
(display range), mechanical resolution/spot size error (display range) and
digital processing constraints. HRM resolution is limited by PLE as well,
although the error can be mitigated by selecting a smaller display range.
HRM resolution is also limited by mechanical resolution and digital
processing constraints.

Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_15.jpeg:
UNCONTROLLABLE FACTORS

Uncontrollable factors are things you cannot control, but still affect the
radar display. They are the characteristics of topographic and cultural
features; size, shape and composition of the objects; the relationship of
objects to one another; and unusual returns.

Topographic Features

One of the most important ways an air-to-ground radar presents
information is through contrasts between rough and smooth surfaces.
Smooth surfaces on the ground appear as blank areas of no return on the
display; in contrast, rough areas appear as bright returns. A smooth
surface, such as a calm sea, reflects radar energy away from the receiving
antenna; a rough surface, such as a rugged mountain, scatters radar
energy in all directions. Some of this energy is reflected to the radar
receiver and displayed as bright images of varying intensity on the radar
display (Figure D-5). The exception is a radar altimeter which radiates
basically straight down and operates very well over calm seas.

AGR-01-05

Figure D - 5. Rough Terrain.

D-9 AGR-1


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_16.jpeg:
Mountains are excellent reflectors of radar energy. The steeper the
mountain near side gradient, the greater the energy returned to the radar
receiver. The near side of the mountain produces a bright return, with a
shadow (no-show area) behind it. The shadow is caused by the radar
energy being blocked from reaching the back side of the mountain and the
area adjacent to the back side of the mountain. Remember, radar waves
travel in a straight line, line of sight fashion. Rolling or flat terrain
produces uniform returns and little or no shadows. Understanding bright
returns on the radar display is important, but understanding terrain
shadowing, particularly at low altitude, is equally important. Mountain
shadows lengthen as aircraft altitude decreases and/or when range to the
mountain increases. Analysis of unique peak and shadow combinations
helps identify points of interest. Also, shadows can be used to monitor
terrain clearance and provide a good cross-check when accomplishing
terrain following radar (TFR) operations. If the aircraft is well above a
given peak, little or no shadowing appears. If the aircraft is above the
peak, the shadow converges behind the return (Figure D-6, A). Ifthe
aircraft is below the peak, the shadow diverges behind the return and
extends the full length of the scope (Figure D-6, B).

AGR-1 D-10


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_17.jpeg:
This divergence can be hard to see, so use caution and consider shadows
running parallel to the edges of the return, or shadows that extend the
length of the radar display as equally dangerous.

At very low altitudes even a small knoll may cast a long shadow. This

vertical development produces bright returns and deep shadows at low
level. The key is ensuring you receive ground returns past the obstacle
before getting too close. If you do not, you may be below the obstacle.

Cultural Features

Cultural features (Figure D-7) generally produce good returns, primarily
due to their composition and steep vertical development. Large cities
provide excellent returns, but may be too large for precise navigation
unless specific sections of the city can be distinguished from others; i.e.,
industrial complexes and commercial areas. Suburbs and small towns can
be hard to detect, particularly in mountainous areas. Many small cities
and towns are often laid out in cardinal headings, so approaching the
target from one of these directions should help target acquisition. A small
town that may not show on a 225° heading might show well on a heading
of 270°. Large military airfields are usually located away from large
cities, and the aircraft, hangars, etc., give good contrast to the flat
(no-show) runway and ramp areas.

AGR-01-07

Figure D - 7. Cultural Terrain Features.

D-11 AGR-1


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_18.jpeg:
In RBM, railroads and highways often do not show well, but the built-up
areas along them may show the trend of their routes. At very low
altitude, railway and highway embankments can be identified at short
range over flat terrain if you choose an axis of flight 90° to the
embankment. Marshaling yards produce good return signals if a number
of tracks and cars are concentrated in a small area.

Large steel bridges are excellent reflectors at low altitude, particularly
when seen against a water background and approached at right angles.
Small bridges are usually lost in the ground clutter. Wharves, piers, and
breakwaters show well against a water background (no-show) and make
excellent low level radar navigation checkpoints.

Land/water contrast provides good information for low level radar
navigation. Islands and shorelines produce brighter returns, and are
contrasted against the no-show area of the water. Choose this type of
return when possible, since it is easily identifiable at low level and
remains recognizable through a large range of tilt and gain settings.
Although rough seas can cause returns on the display from the choppy
surface, the returns are weak in comparison to land returns and there is
little possibility of confusing them.

At low level in mountainous areas, the no-show area of a lake is often
hidden by mountain shadows. To avoid this problem, choose another axis
of attack or altitude in preflight planning. En route, reduce the gain and
look for a bright return on the far shore of the lake, with a no-show area
on the near side. The no-show areas of rivers and lakes approached at
right angles appear similar to their depiction on the map. Small rivers
often disappear in the ground clutter.

Target Size

The larger the reflective area scanned by the radar beam, the more energy
reflected back to the radar system. It is easier to detect a large industrial
complex on radar than it is to detect an individual building. As seen in
Figure D-8, any cultural or terrain feature that extends above the surface
reflects more energy than flat terrain. The amount of energy reflected
depends upon the width and height of the object (surface area). For
example, assume targets A and B are of the same material and at the
same range from the antenna; and target B is twice the size of target A.
This means object B intercepts and returns twice the amount of radar
energy as object A.

Target Shape

Shape plays a role in determining the amount of energy returned. Most
structures in cultural areas are rectangular or square in shape and
present good reflecting surfaces. The amount of energy reflected back to
the antenna varies with the angular reference to the radar beam
(Figure D-9).

In Figure D-10, building A presents a reflecting surface at a right angle to

In Figure D-11, the building acts as a “corner reflector” and reflects
maximum energy back to the antenna. The principle involved is similar to
tossing a rubber ball into a corner. The ball returns in the same path
from which it was thrown. The ideal reflective shape would be an “L”
shaped building, with the attack axis going into the interior corner formed
by the “L.”

Target Composition

An object’s structural material is an important factor in determining its
capability for reflecting radar energy. Although size is the primary
determinant of the amount of radar energy intercepted, surface
composition governs the amount of energy an object reflects. In general,
the denser the structural material, the better its reflective qualities.
Figure D-14 shows comparative densities and, therefore, reflectivity of
some materials. Less dense materials such as vegetation tend to absorb
and diffuse radar energy. If you can determine the structural material of
an object, you can predict its relative brightness on the display.

Target Relationships

Relationships between objects definitely affect radar display
presentations. Small objects close together tend to increase reflections
and produce a brighter single return (Figure D-15). If these objects were
isolated, they might not show on the display, due to their small size, and
in any event would not produce individual radar returns until a closer
range was achieved.

AGR-01-15

Figure D - 15. Small Objects Close Together.

Unusual Returns

Sometimes radar returns are observed which appear to be unusual. These
are caused by weather, climatic conditions, jamming, and cardinal effect.

A few weather conditions (sufficient quantities of moisture droplets or ice
crystals) reflect radar energy and cause returns to appear on the radar
display. Fully developed thunderstorms create bright returns and have
shadows behind them similar to mountain returns.

To positively identify a thunderstorm use the RBM mode and raise the

antenna tilt until the ground returns disappear and weather returns
remain on the display.

AGR-1 D - 20


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_27.jpeg:
In extremely cold areas, a reverse effect may be encountered where land
appears as water and water as land. The jagged edges of pack ice along
frozen shorelines produce good returns. The smooth, level condition of
inland snow appears as a no-show area. Frozen lakes are affected in the
same manner, appearing as islands in a no-show area.

Cardinal effect and glitter are related. When the radar beam strikes a
large number of similarly oriented buildings at or near 90°, a large
amount of energy is reflected back, giving an unusually large return on
the radar display. The larger than normal return remains on the display
as long as the radar beam is scanning at or near right angles to the group
of reflective surfaces; e.g., drive-in theater screens (this is sometimes
called the “glitter effect” because of its nonpersistent nature).

Conclusion

Though uncontrollable factors cannot be changed by aviators, their effects
on radar presentations must be understood. The ability to predict
reflected energy intensity from objects is an important factor in successful
mission planning and radar interpretation. Although uncontrollable,
these factors may be compensated for, to some degree. For example, if
objects are isolated or made of low density (low reflectivity) material,
perhaps they should be eliminated from consideration as points of
interest. In some cases, the axis of attack can be varied to enhance the
radar returns.

CONTROLLABLE FACTORS

Aircrew controllable factors include range, altitude, antenna tilt, attack
axis, and receiver gain. These factors and how they are used to best
display various returns are briefly discussed in the following section.
Remember, some of these controllable factors can be utilized to maximize
the positive aspects and/or minimize the negative aspects of some of the
uncontrollable factors.

Range

Range affects the intensity of reflected radar energy received at the radar
antenna. The intensity is inversely proportional to the range of the
aircraft from the reflecting surface.

Altitude

Altitude affects line of sight to the horizon (the amount of world in front of
you that can be seen) and target reflectivity (influenced by the angle of
incidence between the radar beam and the target). Increased altitudes
allow a larger area to be covered by the radar beam, thus making large
terrain features (mountains, for example) more discernable. Smaller/
similar terrain features tend to blend in with their surroundings.
Conversely, decreased altitude produces smaller area coverage by the
radar beam. At lower altitudes smaller features are more discernable, as
shown in Figure D-16.

D - 25 AGR-1


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_32.jpeg:
Tilt

The area covered by the beam is also directly affected by the angle of the
radar relative to the horizon (tilt angle). Elevation control (tilt) changes
the graze angle of the radar. Assuming altitude remains constant, the
larger the tilt angle, the less area covered (Figure D-17). At the shallow
graze angles associated with F-15E missions, the major portion of the
RBM range scale is illuminated. At steeper graze angles, the pencil beam
limits illumination in range. For example, at a 20° graze angle, only 10%
of the range scale will contain video, and the illuminated portion shrinks
as the graze angle increases. Use elevation control to illuminate the
desired area. When entering RBM, the radar attempts to position the
antenna elevation to illuminate the selected range scale. If unable, the
radar points the antenna to illuminate the far top portion of the video.
The aircrew can manually position the antenna elevation (in RBM) if the
automatic adjustment is not optimum.

Attack Axis

Attack axis also determines the angle of incidence between the radar
beam and the reflecting surface. The best returns are obtained when the
approach heading to the object is perpendicular to its largest reflecting
surface. However, this is not always possible in combat. Therefore, as the
attack axis departs from the perpendicular, the return may appear
smaller than anticipated, or may not be discernable at all.

AGR-1 D - 26


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_33.jpeg:
Gain

Radar gain controls the intensity of the returns through the receiver and
therefore, the intensity of the returns on the radar display. Gain is
controlled automatically in HRM. RBM has four aircrew selectable gain
levels. High gain settings produce maximum land/water contrast.
Medium settings eliminate weaker signals and are used to differentiate
man-made features (towns or bright spots) from surrounding terrain. Low
gain is used when only the stronger returns are desired. Also, low gain is
normally used to refine aiming once the point has been identified
(pinpoint targets).

PRINCIPLES OF HIGH RESOLUTION MAP (HRM) RADAR
Introduction

Throughout this section, the terms synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and
high resolution map (HRM) radar are used. In simple terms, the F-15E’s
APG-70 uses SAR principles to produce HRM video on a cockpit display
(monochromatic only). The radar uses SAR principles to produce video
with a resolution capability many times that achievable with real beam
map (RBM) mode. Resolution is the minimum distance two objects may
be separated and still be discerned as individual objects rather than one
large object. At 20 nm, HRM provides resolution as good as 17 feet as
compared to 2650 feet for RBM at 20 nm. Alternately, HRM provides a
given resolution capability at much greater ranges from an object than
does RBM. For example, RBM resolution at 10 nm (1300 feet) can be
achieved at 80 nm by HRM (1016 feet).

Antenna Size

One factor affecting resolution capability is the size of the antenna. The
larger the antenna, the better the resolution capability. The F-15E radar
“synthesizes” an antenna that is approximately 1400 feet long. It does so
by taking many “snapshots” as the aircraft (and antenna) moves across
the ground, rather than a single “snapshot” by a large antenna. It
actually simulates a 1400 foot long linear array of small antennas. Each
of these “snapshots” is taken at a slightly different perspective (range and
angle) to the objects within the radar’s field of view. So, information is
gathered by the SAR and stored in computer memory. This information is
then processed by the central computer (CC) to produce high resolution
patch maps.

D-27 AGR-1


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_34.jpeg:
As previously stated, the radar’s antenna position relative to an object on
the ground changes between each “snapshot.” Range is determined by
measuring the time between transmission of a pulse and reception of the
object echo (as with any pulsed radar). Azimuth is determined by doppler
shift (change in frequency and rate of change in frequency). The doppler
effect is a shift in the frequency of a wave reflected by an object in motion.
In the case of an A/G radar, doppler shifts are produced by the motion of
the radar relative to the objects from which the radar’s radio waves are
reflected. If the distance between the radar and a reflecting object is
decreasing, the waves are compressed. Their wavelength is shortened and
their frequency is increased. This is reversed if the distance between the
radar and the object is increasing. In other words, radiated waves are
compressed in the direction of motion and spread out in the opposite
direction. The greater the speed, the greater the effect. The wave is
unaffected only at right angles to the motion. For example, as a train
comes toward you, you can hear a change in the sound of the train’s horn.
This is due to the sound wave being compressed as the train moves toward
you. The rate of change in the sound also increases as the train gets
closer and as the angle between you and the relative motion of the train
approaches 90°. After passing 90°, the sound of the train’s horn wanes.
This is caused by the sound waves expanding instead of being compressed.
Like the train’s horn, doppler frequencies change due to range rate
(relative velocity of the radar) and the angular relationship between the
radar and the object on the ground.

The highest angular resolution that can be obtained through doppler
processing occurs when the combination of doppler frequency and angular
rate of change is optimized. This occurs when the object concerned is 60°
relative bearing from the aircraft.

The information gathered by SAR and stored by the CC is used to
precisely determine the relationship of objects. This information is then
used to construct an extremely accurate scene (the high resolution patch
map) to be displayed.

AGR-1 D - 28


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_35.jpeg:
Factors Affecting HRM Capability
Azimuth

The rate of change of doppler shift directly off the aircraft’s nose is small.
Although HRM is possible within this area, processing time required
makes it impractical for F-15E application. As a result the APG-70 has a
blind zone +8° of the velocity vector. In the blind zone, the computer will
not allow construction of patch maps nor allow HRM PPI video to be
displayed.

For good radar processing, you should position the target as close as
possible to the optimum; that is, as far from the nose as you can.

Figure D-18 shows the effects of angular displacement. The greater the
look angle (also called squint angle), the smaller the resulting map error
will be.

Velocity

Accurate velocities are crucial in HRM because errors in aircraft velocity
cause errors in calculating doppler shift. Therefore, to improve HRM
capability, a feature has been incorporated to update computer velocities
in the mission navigator (CC subprogram). This capability is achieved
from using air-to-ground radar velocities and is called precision velocity
update (PVU). You will learn more about this capability in follow-on
lessons. Figure D-18 illustrates how critical accurate velocities are.
Inaccurate velocities can degrade the quality of the HRM as well as induce
inaccuracies in position. With inaccurate ownship velocities, the relative
location of HRM-displayed geographic features (and therefore the derived
coordinates of the features) are incorrectly computed. Additionally, once
the HRM video is created, the CC’s understanding of where the map
features are relative to the aircraft, over time, is a function of system drift.
Accurate aircraft velocity, via a PVU, make the initial computations more
accurate and decrease the rate of system drift.

Figure D - 18. Velocity Errors Degrade Accuracy.

For example, a one knot velocity error in the system is about 1.7 feet of
drift error each second. If you made a map at 10 nm and then attacked
the target at 500 KTAS, the target would “drift” about 120 feet by the
time you got there (70 seconds ETE). Additionally, with a one knot
velocity error, if you made a map with a 20° squint angle, you would have
a map position error of about 350 feet (Figure D-18). The cumulative
effects of a one knot velocity error could be as much as 470 feet. If you did
a velocity update first that reduced the error to one-half knot, the drift
error would only be 60 feet and the map position error slightly less than
200 feet. Your map/attack would be considerably more accurate. In
actual practice, PVUs provide velocities that are significantly more
accurate than 1 knot (.1-.2 knots).

AGR-1 D - 30


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_37.jpeg:
Range

The velocity errors discussed previously result in an angular error in
measurement on the HRM map. The greater the range, the larger the
error in feet. Therefore, HRM patch map capability and results are
improved at closer ranges. Azimuth error is, in fact, directly proportional
to range.

Aircraft Speed

At higher aircraft speeds the angular movement and doppler frequency
shift are both greater. Remember that large antenna array are created by
moving the APG-70 antenna through the air. Hypothetically, the faster
the antenna moves, the larger the synthetic antenna created.

Maneuvering Flight

In measuring doppler shift, the computer processors compensate for
aircraft movement when maneuvering. Maneuvering simply complicates
the HRM problem and allows less processing time for the HRM
construction. Therefore, the best HRM capability and results are achieved
in nonmaneuvering flight. The F-15E HRM has been designed to
compensate for up to approximately 4 Gs. (In contrast, RBM is insensitive
to aircraft maneuvers up to 7 Gs.)

Graze Angle

The optimum graze angle for the best quality HRM video with the APG-70
radar is between approximately 2° and 10°. At these angles, there is a
good mix of horizontal and vertical target extent. The terrain shadows
supply a two-dimensional look to the map. At higher graze angles (above
20°), the vertical nature of the video is reduced, and the map becomes
one-dimensional and lacks contrast. With low graze angle mapping, the
vertical features can dominate the map and mask targets behind them.
For example, at a 0.5° graze angle (mapping 9.5 nm away at 500 feet
altitude), an eight foot hill line will cast a 900 foot shadow and a 50 foot
ridge will cast a 5700 foot shadow.

predictions.

e For the target area, make predictions for both long and short range:
long to get early determination of target area, and short to break out
the exact target when it becomes radar significant (the resolution is
better).

e Use the AFMSS radar prediction feature (if available).
e Consider land/water contrast, shadows, and snow/ice.

@e Remember that no-show areas such as lakes are usually much more
likely to match their predicted shape.

e Remember that tidal flow can change shape or location of land/water
contrast.

e When preparing HRM patch map predictions, use a clear overlay
showing display window sizes (.67 nm, 1.3 nm, etc.) for the smallest
scale chart you have. Use the outlines to draw a prediction of what
the point of interest will look like on various size patch maps.

e Consider graze angle. If an offset/aim point is too far away (or too
close) to map at your ingress altitude, pick one that is closer (or
farther away). The map does not have to be taken under perfect
conditions, just good enough to find and kill the target.

e Be careful to consider terrain between you and the point of interest to
ensure you will have line of sight. At low altitude, a 200 foot hill will
appear as a very large mountain, and its shadow may obscure the
target.

In short, without thorough preparation, the odds of successful radar
employment are very low!

AGR-1 D - 34


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_41.jpeg:
Interpretation/Technique

The most important factor in evaluating a target’s size, shape, range, and
bearing is the target’s definition on the display. Target definition can be
controlled by manipulation of the display brightness, contrast, and gain
(in RBM). As a rule of thumb, maintain the display brightness and
display contrast as high as possible and adjust the gain (when possible) to
get the best picture.

Concentrate on the scope at the predicted times/ranges.
e Go big to small (use pointer system).
e Use INS/MN as an aid.

Identify the general area in RBM, position the cursor, select the
appropriate display window, offset if necessary, and make a HRM patch
map.

e@ When time permits, start with a larger patch map, identify the
specific area, then make a smaller patch for accurate resolution and
cursor positioning. This helps ensure the desired point is within the
field of view.

Keep aspect in mind when considering different shapes/reflections for
predictions and also changes in aspect angle as the aircraft moves over the
ground.

In summary, the target should be in the general vicinity of the displayed
sequence point if the MN is reasonably accurate. The range should be
changed to put the target in the top half of the display. Analyze the larger
returns and use them as pointers for finding the smaller returns.
Thorough planning is extremely important and radar predictions of each
sequence point you plan to use should be prepared and studied.
Remember, speed is also important since whenever you use the A/G radar,
the A/A radar cannot be used to find air threats. Good planning will
reduce time in the A/G radar to a minimum.

Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_42.jpeg:
Weather Detection

Weather detection and avoidance is possible in RBM mode although only
fairly heavy storms and showers normally show. Remember, there is no
peacetime mission in this command that requires intentional penetration
of a thunderstorm. The radar will help you avoid the weather when there
are no other options.

Radar Display Presentation

Severe weather is displayed on the radar display by bright returns with
indistinct edges or irregular, undefined shapes. Shadowing is quite often
present. Most aircrews describe weather returns as looking like cotton
balls.

Operation

Adjust the antenna elevation up as necessary to optimize weather returns
and remove ground clutter.

Use the antenna elevation scale to determine where you are looking with
reference to the horizon.

Reduce gain as necessary to determine the center and most severe areas of
the storm.

Considerations

Range

The area of the radar beam width increases significantly at long range.
Therefore, it may not be possible to distinguish between cells in close
proximity to each other at greater detection ranges. However, you should
be able to break out most large individual cells and squall lines at the
maximum detection ranges.

AGR-1 D - 36


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_43.jpeg:
Antenna Tilt

In RBM the radar display is stabilized in pitch regardless of AOA or
attitude. Therefore, to search for weather at your altitude you need to
move the antenna elevation to put the caret level on the antenna elevation
scale. You may want to search above or below level to aid in determining
the tops and bottoms of cells. Tops are much easier to determine because
when you search below the storm, ground clutter will also be displayed.
When the top and/or bottom has been determined, some simple math can
be applied to determine the actual altitude. One degree represents 100
feet for each mile of range.

ALT (of weather returns) = Your Altitude + (Elev x Range x 100)

Example: You are at 10,000 feet. Tops of the cells are 2° above you at
20 nm.

Alt

10,000 + (2° x 20 x 100)

10,000 + 4000

14,000 (tops of weather)

Careful manipulation of tilt allows you to determine differences in heights
of individual cells. The really high ones are probably the more severe
thunderstorms. In RBM there is a digital readout (upper left corner) of
the bottom and top of the altitude coverage at the range of the cursor.
Racing the cursor over the video and adjusting the radar tilt until the
video disappears will help determine the top/bottom of the storm cell.

Gain

Gain should be controlled manually to allow accurate interpretation of the
thunderstorm complex. With the gain setting too low only the most severe
areas of the storm will be displayed. Gain set too high results in a
noise-saturated, distorted display and the inability to discriminate
between specific cells or areas of interest. Gain should be constantly
adjusted to produce the sharpest picture.

Other Techniques

Use the mark function to mark the location/boundaries of the weather

INTRODUCTION

The primary mission of the F-15E is all-weather, day/night deep
interdiction. To accomplish this mission, the air-to-ground radar
(APG-70) plays an important role in accurate navigation to the target,
precise target acquisition, and pinpoint weapons delivery. It is imperative
that crew members understand basic radar principles and be familiar with
the F-15E’s radar capabilities.

Effective use of the air-to-ground radar depends largely upon preflight
planning and operator expertise. It is very important to carefully select
radar aim points and offsets that are within the radar’s capabilities. Even
the most experienced operator will be required to study route maps,
photographs, and radar predictions to consistently identify returns.

The following discussion considers two types of radar processing, including
pulsed radar [the APG-70 real beam map (RBM) mode], and doppler radar
[the APG-70 high resolution map (HRM) mode]. The F-15E provides RBM
video in a planned position indicator (PPI) format. It provides HRM video

in both PPI and patch map formats.

RBM provides a radar mapping mode for low resolution ground mapping
and weather detection capability. The video, in PPI format only, refreshes
at approximately one second per sweep and has six selectable range scales
ranging from 4.7 nm to 160 nm.

The HRM mode provides video exhibiting high range and azimuth
resolutions. Video refresh rates vary as a function of aircraft orientation
and map size. Typical construction times range from 2 to 12 seconds
(nominal tactical employment, about 5 to 6 seconds).

D-1 AGR-1


Text from AGR-1_Air-to-Ground_Radar_Introduction_page_8.jpeg:
INHERENT ERRORS

The picture presented on the air-to-ground radar display is seldom a true
representation of the actual size or shape of the corresponding objects on
the ground (particularly in RBM mode). This distortion results from radar
design factors which produce inherent errors. To more accurately
interpret the radar presentation, an operator should know and anticipate
the causes and effects of these errors.

Beam Width Error (BWE)

Beam width error (Figure D-1) is only applicable to the RBM mode of the
APG-70 and is created by the width of the beam transmitted from the
radar. The width of the beam used to illuminate the target is based on
antenna size and is the most serious limitation to azimuth resolution. The
error results as the radar beam scans through space horizontally. The
leading edge of the beam strikes an object before the centerline of the
beam reaches the object. The trailing edge of the beam is still
illuminating the object after the beam centerline has passed the object.
Energy received from any portion of the beam, other than the actual
center of the beam, induces errors in the horizontal dimension. This error
is always in azimuth and applies equally to both sides of the object. Since
the area covered by the beam increases as range increases, the beam
width error also increases. One-half of the total BWE appears on each
side of the target’s radar return. At longer ranges, an object’s radar
return appears much larger than the actual object.

Figure D - 1. Beam Width Error (RBM).

With pulse radars, such as the APG-70 RBM mode, the ability to
differentiate separate objects in azimuth depends on the size of the beam
width and aircraft range to the object. To resolve multiple targets, they
must be separated by at least the beam width (as a function of range).
The F-15E’s inherent beam width is 2%°.

However, the APG-70 and VHSIC CC employ a pseudo monopulse
processing technique that effectively sharpens its beam width to 1%4°. As
a result, the beam width at a given range is halved. In short, the APG-70
beam width error (azimuth resolution) is essentially half that of a
conventional radar with the same size antenna. The F-15E’s effective 11%4°
beam width produces the following:

RANGE FROM TARGET = Beam Width
10 nm = 1325 feet
20 nm = 2650 feet
30 nm = 3975 feet
40 nm = 5300 feet

Updates the mission navigator (MN) and/or inertial
navigation system with reference to cursor position and
the latitude/longitude of the sequence point at PB #17.

Designates the location of the cursor as a target or target

information to the CC for weapons delivery computations.

Directs the TGT IR to the current cursor location.

Stores the latitude, longitude and altitude (if available) of
the cursor position and time of the mark for later use.

Display Window Selected (PB #8)

Eight HRM patch map sizes (.67, 1.3, 3.3, 4.7, 10, 20, 40 and 80 nm
square) and a blank size are selectable via HOTAS only. PB #8 is not
functional. An outline (display window) of the selected patch map size is
also displayed on the radar to show the area to be encompassed if a map is
commanded. If a smaller size is commanded with .67 preselected, the
display window (DW) size blanks and the display window is no longer
displayed. When a map is commanded with the size blank, the map size is
based on cursor position as follows.

PB #9 changes the scan from FULL (100°) to HALF (50°) to QTR (25°)
(Figure D-2). Partial scan (HALF/QTR) is centered on the cursor and is
slewable within the total radar sweep limits (such that the outer limit of
the partial scan cannot exceed + 50° of the aircraft velocity vector). In
FREEZE, the azimuth legend change inputs are ignored until FREEZE is
deselected. A change of radar modes returns the scan to FULL if HALF or

This is displayed below the gray scale and only in the MAP cursor
function. It shows the time required from commanding a patch map to
actual display of the map. When a patch map is commanded, the timer
will count down and at zero, the patch map is displayed. The estimated

IPVU (Interleaved Precision Velocity Update) (PB #16)

The IPVU legend is only displayed in the RBM, HRM PPI and HRM
“patch” radar modes. It is only selectable in the MAP cursor function,
although once selected it is functional in all cursor functions. Once
selected (boxed), whenever the radar is functioning in RBM, HRM PPI or
HRM patch modes (except during actual map construction), the A/G radar
is scheduled to automatically perform a 5-second, four-antenna position
PVU every minute. During the PVU the radar video is not refreshed,
IPVU appears above PB #6 and the resulting INS Vs radar deltas are
automatically accepted by the MN. When IPVU is selected, the results of
the most recent PVU are displayed below the boxed IPVU legend.

Selecting IPVU frees the aircrew from manually selecting the PVU mode,
thus keeping the system velocities accurate with minimum aircrew
attention. Conversely, since the IPVU only occurs while the radar is
functioning in the RBM/HRM modes, if the aircrew elects to use the radar
in the air-to-air mode, the IPVU is not performed. Also, the accuracy of a
dedicated PVU (eight antenna positions) versus that of the IPVU (four
antenna positions) dictate that a dedicated PVU be performed prior to
constructing an HRM patch map prior to an update or designation.

NOTE
If the mode is changed while IPVU is boxed, the IPVU numbers at
PB #16 are removed until a new IPVU is accomplished.

Sequence Point Indicator (PB #17)

The sequence point indicator displays the currently selected radar
sequence point. Pressing PB #17 or selecting quick step with the FCP
coolie switch or RCP castle switch cycles the selected SP among the points
currently displayed on the radar based on range. The sequence point can
also be changed by typing the number in the UFC scratchpad and
pressing PB #17 (or quick stepping with a point in the scratchpad). If
changed via the UFC and the point is not within the selected radar
footprint, the display window/cursor is latched at the top of the scope.
However, azimuth and range readouts at the top left will be to the
sequence point. It is important to note that if the cursor is manually
moved (TDC) after being stepped (UFC/PB #17, cycling PB #17, or
HOTAS), the cursor will not be latched to the sequence point (and the
azimuth and range readouts will be to the cursor but not to the sequence
point).

D-7 AGR-2


Text from AGR-2_APG_70_Intro_page_14.jpeg:
NOTE

If a map is commanded from the TSD, the sequence point number at

PB #17 on the A/G radar display blanks with the new map and
remains blank until the aircrew selects a new sequence point.

SNF (Sniff) (PB #18)

SNF is a receive only mode used to detect jamming or to provide minimum
radar radiation times. It is selectable in RBM, GMT, HRM, PVU and
BCN modes. All cursor functions are available but ground returns are not
present. For a more detailed discussion of SNF, refer to

TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1.

Radar Frequency Select (PBs #19 and #20)

The radar channel and frequency (A-E and 1-8, respectively) are displayed
below PB #19. These 32 different selections allow aircraft within a flight
to avoid interference with each other or from external jamming. Channels
are changed with PB #20 and frequencies, with PB #19. The selected A/G
channel is not carried over to the A/A radar modes. However, the selected
A/A channel is carried over to the A/G modes. For a detailed discussion of
the radar channels, refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1.

Antenna Elevation

Antenna elevation is automatically controlled to cover 60% of the selected
radar range based on altitude. It can be moved manually using trigger
half action and TDC up/down (RCP) or throttle elevation wheel (FCP) in
RBM, GMT and BCN only, but when moved, it may remain in the same
position until moved again. Selecting a larger range scale recalculates the
antenna elevation based on the new range, while smaller range scale
selections attempt to keep the same area illuminated. If the antenna
elevation is manually positioned above the horizon, weather mapping is
assumed. Subsequent range scale changes do not change the elevation
until it is positioned below the horizon.

Ground Moving Target (GMT) Mode (PB #6)

The objective of GMT is the detection of ground moving targets (e.g., truck
convoys). Eventually, target acquisition, tracking and AGM-65 EO IR
missile handoff operations with multiple missile launch will be possible.
Only target detection operations can be accomplished at this
time. The GMT radar mode can be selected as a dedicated mode with no
map background (GMT) or can be selected during RBM operations as an
RBM-GMT interleaved mode (IGMT). Approximately 90-100 detections
can be displayed out to a maximum range of 32 nm. If more than the
allowed symbols are present, the oldest detections are deleted and only
the newest are retained.

Dedicated GMT

GMT can be entered using PB #6 and presents ground moving targets in
the form of plus (+) symbols on a PPI scan format (Figure D-8).

EL Bar Selection (PB #3)

This button allows selection of the number of elevation bars (sweeps, 1-4)
to be included in the frame. At GMT mode entry, the antenna elevation is
positioned so that the top of the radar beam matches the far limit of the
selected range scale. For example, with a 20 nm scale selected, the top of
the GMT beam will be set at 20 nm. The range at the bottom of the beam
depends on aircraft altitude. With multiple bars selected (two or more)
the radar scans from the nearest to the farthest range so that the closer
targets are observed first. For example, with 1-bar selected, if the current
beam coverage is 15-32 nm, selecting 2-bar will increase coverage to

8-32 nm. The first bar will cover 8-15 nm and the second bar will cover
15-32 nm. Selecting 3- or 4-bar will further increase the total range
coverage. Specific range coverage depends on aircraft altitude, antenna
tilt angle and the number of bars selected.

GMT Error Messages

GMT processing can be automatically halted when certain conditions
arise. If the condition requires that GMT processing cease to reinitialize
the frame, FRAME ABORT is displayed. If the condition requires that all
GMT mode processing halt indefinitely, NO GMT is displayed. The
possible error conditions are

e RANGE/ELEV LIMIT - Attempt to process GMTs outside of
elevation or range limits.

e AZ GIMBAL LIMIT - Attempt to process GMTs outside of
azimuth limits.

e PROCESSING ERROR - Internal GMT processing error.

NOTE

The maximum GMT coverage is 32 nm. Therefore, with a 40 nm radar
range selected, the top of the radar beam will be set at 32 nm.

This function is mechanized just as it is in RBM (previously discussed).

Range (PBs #13 and #14)

Ranges available are 4.7, 10, 20 and 40 nm. Mode entry with a range
selection of greater than 40 nm initializes to 40 nm. When the range

RBM. Ground moving targets can only be detected/displayed out to

32 nm.

Freeze

The operator may command freeze. The GMT scan halts immediately and
targets remain on the display at the fixed location.

GMT Range Coverage Circles and Asterisks

The radar displays range cues (small circles) along the displayed ground
track line that represent GMT minimum and maximum range coverage
with the selected el bar setting. In addition to the range cues, asterisk
cues are used to indicate the current GMT scan coverage on the current el
bar. The lower asterisk always represents the minimum scan coverage for
the frame. The upper asterisk represents the maximum range of the
current bar. The cue steps out in range as each (subsequent) bar is
scanned.

GMT Additional Target Indicators

In GMT, the entire + 50° scan is processed, although the farthest range
portions of the extreme azimuths are off the edge of the display. Detected
targets that are AZ limited are indicated by a triangle oriented to point
outboard, toward the limited targets.

High Resolution Map (HRM) Mode

The HRM mode uses synthetic array radar mapping to provide the
increased mapping resolution for improved target detection and accurate
long-range designations. The HRM is displayed in both PPI and patch
map formats. The PPI format (Figure D-5) is similar to the RBM format
except for the doppler notch (an area 8° either side of the velocity vector
where video is not displayed) and that it does not provide a “real time”
radar picture due to the delay required for doppler processing. HRM
ranges are the same as RBM; however, HRM resolution is significantly
better than RBM. HRM takes up to 18 seconds per sweep, vice 1 second
for RBM, and like the RBM display, up to five sequence points can be
presented. HRM patch maps provide greatly enhanced resolution and
magnify selected areas for navigation updates and target designations.

Patch Map Modes

The following functions are available when a patch map is made
(Figure D-7, page D-17).

Map Stabilizing Options (PB #2)

Two options are available: PRG (progressive) and STB (stabilized). In
PRG the azimuth and range, from the aircraft to the area being mapped,
remain the same, while in STB, a specific ground point is continuously
mapped. The radar initializes to STB; PRG can be selected via PB #2.
PRG is essentially a reconnaissance function in that it constructs maps in
a strip map way as the mapped area “snowplows’” along the area being
mapped.

Antenna Azimuth Scan Select (PB #9)

Azimuth scans are centered on the last map center and are the same as
PPI (i.e., if the scan in PPI restricts the horizontal boundaries of the map,
those areas are not displayed when the map is made). If a patch map is
commanded from a PPI display (RBM or HRM), a FULL azimuth patch
map will be made unless the aircrew had a reduced azimuth selected
when last exiting the HRM PATCH mode. Ifthe latter were the case, the
new patch made will be reduced azimuth.

Antenna Elevation

Is automatically centered on cursor position and for the selected range
(not adjustable).

PPI (PB #14)

Depressing the PB commands the radar to the HRM PPI format, which
initializes at the last selected PPI range.

NOTE

Anytime you reject (with the auto acq switch) out of a patch map, the

Recall Options

When freeze is selected in HRM (patch map format), three new options are
added to the display: (1) display brightness adjust for the most recently
constructed map, (2) a recall option and (3) store (STO). In the recall
option, the radar retains or “remembers” two patch maps labeled NEW
and OLD. Each time a new map is made (and automatically displayed),
the previously displayed map becomes the OLD map. These are recalled
alternately by depressing PB #10 (Figure D-7). The options available with

PB #10 are:

NEW

With the radar in FREEZE, NEW indicates that the

map being displayed is the most recent HRM map

created.

OLD

With the radar in FREEZE, OLD indicates that the

map being displayed is not the most recent HRM map

created.

Precision Velocity Update (PVU) Mode

The primary function of the selectable PVU mode (Figure D-9) is to
provide an estimate of velocity error for updating either the INS or MN.
An MN PVU can compensate for velocity errors of up to 150 knots from
the radar. In other words, the INS and MN (with INS input) “think” they
are moving across the surface in a certain direction and rate. This
movement is calculated from accelerations provided to the INS from
aircraft movement. The radar also calculates this movement from the
rate of change of the ground returns it sees. As the radar calculations can
be more accurate, PVU provides the crew with the delta or difference in
perceived movement by the two systems and allows an update if desired.
This delta is displayed beneath RADAR on the PVU display. This
information is also used for in-flight alignments of the INS. The PVU
mode is necessary because even small velocity errors in the INS and MN
can have a significant effect on the accuracy and quality of HRM maps
and therefore, on radar weapons delivery accuracy.

Text from AGR-2_APG_70_Intro_page_26.jpeg:
After TCTO 1F-15E-737, MN and INS PVUs are permitted in any present
position keeping source (PPKS). In embedded GPS/INS (EGI) PPKS MN
PVUs are not necessary prior to HRM patch map construction; however,
INS PVUs are still necessary after replacement of the CC, RDR antenna
or the INS.

With the PVU mode selected, the following options are displayed on the
MPD.

Doppler Bias Select (PB #2)

PB #2 displays either of two selectable options for the INS PVU. LAN or
SEA provides different bias inputs to the PVU, depending upon selection.
The PVU mode initializes with LAN selected. If flying over water, select
the SEA option. However, for MN PVUs, the LAN/SEA option is
nonfunctional. The aircrew may select either option but the PVU will
continue to function as though LAN was selected. SEA is not available
with an in-flight alignment in progress.

RST (Reset) (PB #4)

Reinitializes the PVU operation. Not selectable with an INS PVU or
in-flight alignment in progress. Selecting RST provides the same results
as exiting and then reentering the PVU mode. Prior MN velocity updates
stored in memory are not affected by RST.

CLR (Clear) (PB #5)

CLR is provided to give the operator the means to delete an MN velocity
update that may have been in error. Not selectable after PVU update is
commanded for the INS or if in an in-flight align mode.

MN (Mission Navigator) (PB #8)

MN is selected (boxed) upon PVU mode entry. The MN velocities are
updated if the operator accepts the PVU errors with MN selected.

Text from AGR-2_APG_70_Intro_page_27.jpeg:
INS Unertial Navigation System) (PB #9)

With INS boxed when the operator accepts PVU errors, the INS PVU
process begins, continuously updating the INS velocities. When update is
commanded, options displayed at PBs #4 and #5 are removed.

IFA (In-flight Alignment)

Displayed at PB #10 when INS has been cycled from OFF to NAV during
flight. With an IFA in progress, options at PBs #2, #4 and #5 are not
selectable. Utilized only when the INS has malfunctioned and needs
realigning in flight.

Beacon (BCN) Mode

The primary purpose of BCN (Figure D-10) is to use a ground-based
beacon for radar/offset bombing. Two different beacon codes can be
interrogated. The radar does not display normal video returns but instead
displays beacon location in range and azimuth. The beacon return
consists of four horizontal lines in range order. The strobe closest in range
is the actual position of the beacon. Like RBM and HRM, targets can be
designated in BCN. Peculiar BCN display controls follow.

Cursor Function Select (PB #7)

Only MAP and TGT are available in the BCN mode. The target functions
are the same as RBM. The MAP function is available only so that HOTAS
functions that are available only in MAP cursor function are usable in
BCN (mode reject to RBM, for example).

EL Bar Scan

Five different elevation scans—1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 bar scan—can be selected
via PB #15 to facilitate beacon detection.

Air-to-Ground Ranging (AGR)

The air-to-ground ranging mode provides slant range information for
weapons delivery computations and position updates. The radar slant
range is displayed in digital form on the A/G radar format and on the
HUD above the NAV data block. Radar slant range is also displayed on
the HUD A/G reticle via an analog bar (large reticle) or an analog cue
(small reticle) (Figure D-11). AGR is not selectable from the A/G radar
format. Its selection is a function of the type of weapons delivery or
position update, weapons delivery modes, sensor priority, etc., all of which
are discussed in later lessons.

INTRODUCTION

The F-15E A/G radar (APG-70) has five operating modes: real beam map
(RBM), ground moving targets (GMT), high resolution map (HRM), beacon
(BCN) and precision velocity update (PVU). The radar also has an
air-to-ground ranging mode (AGR).

Included in these modes is the ability to create a high resolution patch
map (MAP), perform position updates to the navigation systems (UPDT),
designate targets (TGT), cue the targeting IR (CUE) and mark the
latitude and longitude of points of interest (MARK). The A/G radar
display can only be displayed on the MPDs (not MPCDs). Table D-1
summarizes the different modes, their performance and their purpose.

RADAR MODES
Real Beam Map (RBM) (PB #6)

The purpose of RBM is to provide a conventional radar mode for ground
mapping and weather detection. The RBM format (Figure D-1) is a plan
position indicator (PPI) display, which takes approximately 1 second per
sweep and provides six ranges (from 4.7 to 160 nm). Up to five sequence
points and five mark points can be simultaneously presented on the RBM
display. The following discussion explains the pushbutton options
counterclockwise from PB #2.

DCL (Declutter) (PB #2)

DCL removes the magnetic north indicator, all sequence points and their
related numbers from the radar display. If declutter is selected and an
HRM patch map is created from RBM, it will also be decluttered. The
declutter option is selectable/deselectable in all cursor functions and all
modes except BCN.

GC (Gain Control) (PB #8)

There are four selectable gain settings, 0-3, with 0 being the lowest gain
setting and 3 being the highest. This controls intensity of radar returns
through the receiver. GC3 is recommended for normal operation.

Display Brightness Adjust (DBA) (PBs #4 and #5)

Brightness of the map display is controlled through 16 selectable levels of
brightness (0-15), provided you are not in FREEZE. Once set, brightness
will be retained for a specific mode, provided all mode changes are made
via HOTAS. Ifthe radar mode is changed by using PB #6, the brightness
level defaults to 8. An eight-shade gray scale is located in the lower right
corner of the display to aid in optimizing MPD brightness/contrast
adjustment.

Radar Mode Select (PB #6)

Individually selects the five radar modes: RBM, GMT, HRM (PPI), BCN
and PVU. HRM patch map is not selectable. Usually when PB #6 is used
to select a different radar mode, the radar range initializes to that selected
in the last PPI mode. You can also enter various A/G radar modes via
taking command of the A/G radar display, thus taking the radar from an
A/A radar mode or from AGR; or you can enter some radar modes (RBM,
PVU, HRM patch) via mode reject from another A/G radar mode. The
various mode parameters can initialize to values based on how you
selected the mode, what mode you selected from and the previous
parameters. As you move among the various A/G radar modes, you should
check the parameters, ensuring they are set correctly.

stabilized up to +10° of drift, the line can be used as a ground
track reference.

I BIT window area - is located on the lower left side of the A/G
format and is used to display mode, restart and BIT information.
The window displays PVU when IPVU is selected during RBM or
HRM and the radar is performing PVU. It also displays RNG
when the radar is in the air-to-ground ranging mode. Located
above the BIT window area is an arrow indicating magnetic
north. The magnetic north arrow can rotate as required and will
freeze when patch map is commanded. The arrow is removed
when declutter is selected.

O Azimuth (Az), range (R) and altitude (ALT) - indicate cursor
position on the radar display in relation to the aircraft. ALT is
displayed in RBM only and defines the radar altitude coverage at
the range of the cursor. ALT is normally used only for weather
detection/assessment.

P Mark points (V) - indicate positions that have been marked by
performing an overfly mark via the UFC, a radar mark via the
A/G radar display or an automatic overfly mark when the
weapon release button is depressed. A maximum of ten positions
can be marked and stored. If an eleventh position is marked,
mark point 1 is overwritten. A maximum of five mark points can
be displayed at any one time. There is no provision for
sequencing to mark points on the A/G radar display. Mark points
cannot be deleted. Some types of weapons deliveries create mark
points at the target. If a radar target is cluttered with mark
points created by previous weapons deliveries, pushing the UFC
keypad mark button (M) will delete those mark points by
repositioning them to the current aircraft position.

A/G RADAR HANDS ON CONTROLS

Many functions of the air-to-ground radar are controlled by using the stick
and throttles in the FCP and the hand controllers in the RCP.

Front Cockpit Control Stick

The auto acq switch on the front cockpit control stick provides access to
several A/G radar features. Its exact function depends on the selected
cursor function (Figure D-10).

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_21.jpeg:
In general, mode reject (in MAP cursor function) takes the A/G radar to
RBM unless already in RBM (Figure D-11). Mode reject to RBM resets
the radar range to that selected in the last PPI mode (HRM or RBM).
Mode reject from RBM takes the radar to PVU. (Exception: If the
sequence point at PB #17 is changed on the PVU display, mode reject then
results in a patch map being constructed of the sequence point.)

Front Cockpit Throttles

Five switches on the throttles (Figure D-12) affect the A/G radar: coolie
switch, TDC, laser fire, el wheel and boat switch.

Coolie Switch

UP quick steps the cursor between displayed sequence points (any except
MARK) in range order regardless of radar mode or cursor function. The
sequence point number under PB #17 also changes to match cursor
position. When the cursor position has been moved to the farthest
displayed point, the next UP movement of the coolie switch causes SP to
be displayed at PB #17 and the cursor goes to the center of the MPD.
Subsequent movements of the coolie switch start the entire sequence over
again, beginning with the closest displayed sequence point.

NOTE

The coolie switch does not position the cursor over MARK points.

When in the PVU mode, sequence points change in numerical order and
the only indication of cursor movement is the sequence point displayed
under PB #17 and the cursor azimuth and range change.

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_23.jpeg:
TDC

The TDC is used to move cursor position (all PB #7 cursor functions) and

controls the pattern steering line (TGT cursor function and a target

designated). Depressing and releasing the TDC performs the following

action based on the selected cursor function:

MAP Commands an HRM patch map at the current cursor position.

TGT Designates the current cursor position as a target. When the
PSL is enabled (arrowhead), designates the PSL (arrowhead
changes to circle).

UPDT Commands a position update for the MN and/or INS/MN based
on the currently selected sequence point (displayed under PB
#17) and the current cursor position.

MARK _ Labels the current cursor position as a mark point.

CUE Cues the TGT IR to the current cursor position.

The TDC also commands the system to accept a MN PVU, when PVU is
selected at PB #6.

Boat Switch

Aft undesignates the pattern steering line and/or ground target if in the
A/G master mode and not in command of the A/A radar display.

El Wheel
The el wheel changes antenna elevation in the RBM and GMT modes.

Laser Fire Button

Depressing and releasing the laser fire switch freezes/unfreezes the radar
in RBM, HRM (PPI or patch map) and GMT.

Castle Switch

Forward selects MAP, right selects UPDT (except in GMT), aft selects
TGT, and left selects CUE and MARK. Depressing and releasing quick
steps the cursor, in range order, over displayed sequence points. When
the cursor position has been moved to the farthest displayed point, the
next depression of the castle switch causes SP to be displayed at PB #17
and the cursor goes to the center of the MPD. A subsequent depression of
the castle switch starts the entire sequence over again, beginning with the
closest displayed sequence point.

AGR-3 D-18


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_25.jpeg:
TDC

The TDC moves cursor position and (in TGT cursor function) controls the
pattern steering line when enabled. Antenna elevation is changed by
holding the trigger half action and depressing the rim of the TDC.
Depressing the forward edge raises the antenna and depressing the back
edge lowers it. When in FREEZE, depressing and releasing the TDC with
the trigger half action EXPANDS the HRM patch map display.

Trigger
Full action and release is used to command the selected cursor function.
In conjunction with other switches, the trigger performs the following

functions:

@ Half action (HA) on the trigger with TDC rim pressure controls
RBM/BCN/GMT antenna elevation in MAP.

@ HA on the trigger with auto acq forward/aft selects RBM/HRM
PPI/GMT range scale in all cursor functions.

@ HA on the trigger followed by TDC pressed/released, when in FREEZE,
performs the EXPAND option while in MAP with STO not selected
(HRM patch map only).

Laser Fire Button

Depressing and releasing the laser fire button freezes/unfreezes the radar.

D-19 AGR-3


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_26.jpeg:
Auto Acq Switch

Auto acq function is dependent on the cursor function selected. In MAP,
moving the auto acq switch forward reduces the selected display window
size and aft increases display window size. If the trigger is held half
action, moving the auto acq switch forward selects smaller radar ranges
and aft selects larger ranges. If the auto acq is depressed and released
(map cursor function), the radar changes modes with the same logic that
applies to the FCP auto acq (Figure D-14). Mode reject to RBM resets the
radar range to that last selected in RBM. In TGT, alternately pulling aft
enables or disenables the PSL (if the target is designated) and depressing
and releasing it undesignates the PSL and/or the target. The auto acq
switch has no effect in MARK or CUE cursor functions.

PROCEDURES AND LIMITS

This section covers required procedures to detect ground moving targets
(GMT), create HRM patch maps, update the INS/MN using the A/G radar,
designate targets for weapon delivery, cue the targeting pod, and mark
points. Limitations associated with each are addressed, and additional
features such as FREEZE, EXPAND and SET are also discussed.

GMT/IGMT Mode

In this mode, the A/G radar detects ground moving targets (e.g., trucks,
convoys, Scuds). Targets can be detected out to 32 nm. Dedicated GMT
has no map background. Interleaved GMT (IGMT) is an interleaved
technique to present moving targets on a mapped background. Selecting
GMT at PB #6 commands dedicated GMT. Boxing IGMT at PB #10
interleaves moving target detection with mapping (Figure D-15).

Figure D - 16. Map Cursor Function.

Position the cursor. This can be done using the TDC, but initially it is
done by quick stepping to the desired sequence point. This ensures that
the cursor is placed at the same latitude and longitude as the sequence
point. More importantly, the sequence point under PB #17 also matches
the point you have stepped to, so the CC is informed concerning which
point is being referenced.

Select the desired display window (DW) size using the auto acq switch.
Ensure area to be mapped is:

@ not within 8° either side of the velocity vector (blind zone)

@ not more than 60° off the velocity vector (gimbal limit)

@ within the minimum and maximum ranges for the selected display
window size (DW range limit):

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_34.jpeg:
The quality of patch maps can be improved by:

@ ensuring the velocities are accurate; velocity errors equate to
inaccurate information provided to the radar and the CC.
Accomplishing a PVU just prior to making maps is the best method.

After TCTO 1F-15E-737 with EGI as the present position keeping
source (PPKS), MN PVUs are not necessary to update velocities prior
to constructing patch maps. However, INS PVUs will still be necessary
to correct any radar pointing errors that may be present.

@ having the area to be mapped at least 30° off the nose.
@ making the map at the closest range practical.
@ making the map while at high airspeed and straight-and-level.

@ climbing to an altitude that provides an antenna graze angle greater
than 1°.

Conversely, maps made near the blind zone take longer, are not as
accurate, are of poorer quality, and are much more sensitive to
maneuvering/slow airspeed.

Freeze
Autofreeze

Autofreeze is commanded when less than 75% of the selected map area is
mappable. An AUTO FREEZE cue is displayed in the upper half of the
HRM display format. With no operator intervention, the system waits for
the point to become mappable again. At that time, AUTO FREEZE is
removed and mapping automatically commences. If automatic return to
mapping is not desired, the operator should manually select FREEZE.

Manual Freeze

The capability to freeze the current radar video is available in all cursor
functions.

RBM Freeze (Figure D-19). Selecting FREEZE halts continuous mapping
following completion of the current RBM sweep and allows the operator to
keep the current RBM video indefinitely. An HRM patch map commanded
from a frozen RBM is also frozen.

for any cursor function that requires accurate cursor placement (TGT,
UPDT). Any time the operator stops continuous HRM mapping by

made and the legend above PB #10 changes to OLD (Figure D-21, Right).
Subsequent PB #10 selections toggle between these two maps. If another
map is subsequently commanded, it overwrites the map not currently
being displayed (regardless of whether it was labeled OLD or NEW), and
the one that was displayed becomes the “OLD” map.

operator centers the cursor on the desired area, selects HA on the trigger,

three and if a display window outline is present, it is removed. The cursor
is centered unless it is in such a position that the entire area around it
cannot be expanded (i.e., cursor at the edge of the display). In this case,
the available area is expanded and the cursor is located off center at the
correct latitude and longitude. EXPAND should be accomplished after the
point of interest has been positively identified due to the very small area
displayed and the grainy presentation. To exit the EXPAND mode, the
operator can use the RECALL button (PB #10) to return to the original
map, or depress the auto acq switch to mode reject to RBM. The EXPAND
option is not available when STORE is selected. Thus, STORE should be

Position Updating

The MN or INS/MN present position can be updated from RBM, HRM PPI
or patch map formats. Procedures for all three are the same. The update
requires that the cursor is positioned over the radar video as accurately as
possible. For this reason, a patch map is usually used to accomplish an
update. (See Figure D-25 for patch map symbology.)

Figure D - 25. MN Update.

Select the UPDT cursor function. IPVU (adjacent to PB #16) is replaced
by MN with N/S and E/W errors displayed in feet; however, if either error
exceeds 3000 feet, both are displayed in miles to the nearest tenth. The
INS/MN uses the latitude and longitude of the point listed under PB #17
and compares that to the actual cursor position to determine INS/MN
errors. Pressing PB #16 allows toggling between INS and MN. In HRM
patch map with INS selected, the counter displayed above PB #7 UPDT
legend represents the time (seconds) remaining before the current HRM
map is too old for an INS position update (90 seconds from map
construction, Figure D-26). The counter is not displayed with MN selected
at PB #16.

D- 35 AGR-3


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_42.jpeg:
The UPDT cursor function defaults to MN because the mission navigator
computer routine is more flexible and “more forgiving” than the INS when
it comes to updates. For instance, if the aircrew makes a position update
mistake to the MN, it can easily be corrected by accomplishing a MN
RESET via the UFC, correcting whatever error was made on the previous
attempt, and then performing another update. If the aircrew makes an
update error with INS selected, there is NO WAY to remove the position
update once it has been entered. Because of this, MN updates, instead of
INS, are usually accomplished.

Position the cursor over the update point. Once the map is created and
you are satisfied with the image, select FREEZE. This prevents the radar
display from “jumping” when the next patch map is created. Use the TDC
as required to “fine tune” the cursor position.

Ensure cursor position matches the sequence point listed under PB #17.
Again, quick stepping to the sequence point before making a patch map
eliminates the mismatch error. If it is incorrect or displays SP, type the
correct sequence point number in the UFC scratch pad and press PB #17
(or quickstep to the correct sequence point).

Prior to updating ensure:

@ asystem update is not being accomplished using another method (an
MN position update using the UFC, for instance).

@ the timer above the cursor function has not counted down to zero (INS
only).

AGR-3 D - 36


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_43.jpeg:
Command the update. “UPDATE” is displayed for 5 seconds. During a
MN position update, errors are zeroed out and the sequence point symbols
are repositioned to the cursor (Figure D-26). During an INS position
update, the errors decrease but they do not zero and the sequence point
symbol will not move all the way to the cursor due to Kalman filtering of
the update.

Figure D - 26. INS Update.

If a MN update was accepted and subsequently determined to be bad, the
MN can be reset on the UFC update select submenu (MN RESET).

NOTE

If the INS is selected as the PP keeping source (on the UFC) and the MN is
updated, HUD/ADI/HSI/TSD etc. NAV information is not affected. If the
MN is selected as the PP source on the UFC and the MN is updated,
HUD/ADI/HSI/TSD etc. steering will change. Sequence point symbols on
the A/G radar display are always repositioned when either MN or INS

radar update is performed. If a target has been designated prior to the
update, the designated target symbology is not repositioned. After
TCTO 1F-15-737, if the EGI is the PPKS, sequence point symbols will be
placed by the EGI. Radar position updates should not be necessary with
the EGI selected as the PPKS.

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_44.jpeg:
To update the INS, the procedures are the same, except for depressing
PB #16 to change MN to INS (Figure D-27). The following considerations
apply:

@ Ifan INS update is accepted, both the INS and MN are updated

@ 100% of the update is accepted by the MN while only a percentage of
the update is accepted by the INS (see INS lesson for more details)

If an INS update is desired and the timer counts down to zero, there are
several ways to reinitialize the timer. In RBM, the time expiring means
the cursor needs to be repositioned in order to perform an INS position
update. In HRM, the time expiring means a new map must be
constructed to do an INS position update. Reselect MAP cursor function
and construct a new patch map.

When steering to the target other than the line of sight steering is desired,
the PSL can be positioned by the operator to the desired approach
heading. Once the PSL is designated, the HUD steering directs an
approach to the target on the desired run-in heading, rather than line of
sight direct to the target.

NOTE

If a target offset is used to designate a target, PSL symbology is not displayed
on the target offset point; it is only displayed on the radar-designated target. If

the target is displayed within the radar video, the PSL steering can still be
enabled, slewed and designated. If the target is not displayed within the radar
video, then PSL steering is not available.

and the PSL can be controlled with the TDC.

NOTE

Pulling aft on the auto acq switch again disables the PSL slewing, which
returns the PSL to the current target line of sight.
With the TDC, adjust the PSL until the desired run-in heading is
displayed. After obtaining the desired run-in heading, initiate the
designation action to obtain PSL steering. The arrowhead becomes a

Figure D - 31. PSL Slewing/Designation.

AGR-03-31

The PSL steering algorithm attempts to direct the aircraft such that the
last 15 seconds of the attack is flown wings level along the selected
heading. PSL steering uses a turn angle limit, so that if the PSL heading
is greater than approximately +80° off the target line of sight bearing,
PSL steering is replaced with straight in steering (the HUD bank steering
bar is replaced with the azimuth steering line). A level weapon delivery is
assumed when bombing with a designated PSL. The HUD pull up cue
and TPULL (time to pull) are not displayed.

AGR-3 D - 42


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_49.jpeg:
In short, HUD PSL steering is not available if PSL heading differs from
target direct steering by more than 30° or if more than 60° of bank is
needed to roll the aircraft on the requested run-in by 15 seconds prior to
computed weapons release.

PSL undesignate is performed in the same manner as a target
undesignate (cursor function TGT and mode reject). To undesignate the
target (after the PSL is undesignated), the undesignate action must be
performed a second time. When the target is undesignated, all attack
steering is removed from the HUD. PSL/target undesignate can be
accomplished in the front cockpit by moving the boat switch aft (must be
in the A/G master mode) and not in command of the A/A radar.

with a mark point number above it (Figure D-35). Only ten positions can
be marked and a maximum of five can be displayed at any one time. If an
eleventh point is marked, the first mark point is overwritten. Sequence
point stepping does not include mark points. The cursor must be slewed
to a displayed mark point in order to perform MAP, UPDT, TGT or CUE
functions at the mark point. The mark point will also be displayed on the
TSD, if within TSD area coverage. Aircraft steering to a mark point is
achieved by entering MX (x=1-10) as the current aircraft sequence point
(PB #10 on UFC Menu 1 or Data 1). Some types of weapons deliveries
create mark points at the target location. If the radar target is cluttered
with mark points created by previous weapons deliveries, pressing the
UFC key pad mark button will remove them, by resetting them to the
aircraft position. Aircrews will, as technique, sometimes use this
procedure to put all the stored mark points from previous sorties in the
pretakeoff parking spot or arming area.

RADAR NAVIGATION
Preflight

Predictions of update points, targets and offsets should be obtained from
the best available source: photos, AFMSS or drawings. Remember that
attack and ingress routes significantly impact radar display presentations
and you may only get one chance.

Whenever possible, select aim points, offsets, etc. that will be well outside
the blind zone during the route leg or target run. Ideally, you should
make HRM patch maps when the point is at least 30° off the nose.
Because of the nature of Synthetic Aperture Radar, such maps can be
constructed more quickly and are more accurate than maps made near the
blind zone. Between 30-50° is the HRM “sweet spot” (Figure D-39).

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_59.jpeg:
When determining the altitude to map from, you must consider two
factors: radar line of sight (LOS) and graze angle. LOS is limited by the
curvature of the earth and by intervening obstacles, such as hills and
ridge lines. Table D-1 shows the maximum LOS range over flat terrain.
If there is high terrain along the route, you may have to climb
significantly to get a map. Study the surrounding terrain and look for
Mapping opportunities when you can achieve LOS with minimum
exposure. If you can find such “windows of opportunity,” mark them on

the low level chart.

AGR-3 C-2


Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_60.jpeg:
Graze angle has a great deal of impact on the quality of the HRM picture.
Higher graze angles result in very sharp contrast between “show” and
“no-show” areas. Bomb circles, runways and roads usually show clearly.
At lower graze angles, these features start to blend in with the
surrounding terrain. Cultural returns with vertical development, such as
buildings, stand out well at low graze angles. However, map quality is
reduced at low graze angles (low look-down angles). The actual graze
angle you achieve depends on the terrain, but you can make a “flat earth”
estimate using the 1:60 rule (Table D-2). For example, at 1000 feet and
10 nm an approximate 1° graze angle can be achieved. Good quality maps
can be achieved at a 1° graze angle and with good planning, useful maps
can be made from as little as .5° graze angle, i.e., 500 feet and 10 nm.
Thus as the graze angle decreases, selection of aim points and offsets
becomes increasingly important.

Text from AGR-3_Modes_Controls_and_Displays_page_61.jpeg:
As a general guideline for planning, aim and offset points should be within
10 nm of course, 30-50° off the nose, not obscured by intervening terrain,
and have physical characteristics as mentioned earlier. Cluttered
environments, like rolling wooded hills, provide unique problems different
from those faced when map planning in desert terrain. For example, the
presence of 50-80 foot trees around the desired offset or aim point make
target acquisition more difficult than if they were not present. Since these
obstacles increase the altitude required to map the intended point, a new
point may have to be selected.

Keep in mind that a MN PVU should be performed prior to commanding a
patch map. Therefore, an additional 15-20 seconds or approximately

2-3 nm is added to the equation of when to begin the PVU/patch map
sequence. After TCTO 1F-15E-737, if the EGI is the PPKS, PVUs are not
required prior to map construction.

In-Flight Operation

Since the same radar provides A/A and A/G capability, you must time
share the system between modes. Most of the time, the radar is devoted
to A/A search. By monitoring route symbols on the TSD and radar, you
can estimate when the next aim point is approaching the HRM “sweet
spot.” Before mapping, however, accomplish a MN PVU, if it has been
more than 5 minutes since the last one.

Scroll to A/G radar, take command and select PVU mode. After accepting
the update, return to RBM and check the RBM display to ensure there are
radar returns under the appropriate symbol. This ensures you have LOS
to the point. Command the map, freeze the first acceptable patch map,
command additional maps, as required, and update/target as required,
and then go back to A/A search.

Radar updates are normally performed only for the MN, unless the INS
has excessive drift. If possible, update the MN approaching the target
area. This positions symbology more accurately on the radar display and
aids you in finding the target or offset. After TCTO 1F-15E-737, if the
EGI is the PPKS, sequence point symbols will be placed by the EGI.
Radar position updates should not be necessary with the EGI selected as
the PPKS.

A Antenna elevation scale - used to determine radar antenna
elevation in degrees. Scale is marked 0 (level), +1°, +2°, +5° and
+10° elevation.

B_ Pitch ball - displayed to indicate aircraft pitch angle with respect
to the horizon. The pitch ball is a circle if the INS is providing
attitude data over the radar high speed data bus (HSDB). If the
AHRS provides the attitude data, the pitch ball changes to a
small rectangle. If both the INS and AHRS stop communicating
on the radar HSDB, the pitch ball changes to an X.

After TCTO 1F-15E-737, the pitch ball is a circle if the INS is
providing the attitude data over the radar HSBD. If the INS
stops communicating on the radar HSDB, the embedded
GPS/INS (EGI) provides attitude data and the pitch ball changes
to a diamond. If both the INS and EGI stop communicating on
the radar HSDB, the pitch ball changes to an X.

Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_10.jpeg:
The UTM coordinates are entered as one number (meters) starting with
the east component and followed by the north. The east and north
components are entered in true direction (rather than magnetic direction).
In Figure D-2, the east component is 69,135 meters (true) and the north
component is 90,285 (true). Combining the components into a single
number, they are entered into the UTM submenu at PB #38 as
6913590285. UTM coordinates must be entered with an even number of
digits. If the components are not measured to the same magnitude,
leading zeros are added to the components to keep the number of
component digits the same. Additionally, trailing zeros need not be
entered as the system uses the first half of the digits as the east
component and the second half as the north component (e.g., to enter a
component of 64,120 meters east and 520 meters north of the block
identifier, enter 64120052). When entered, this will be displayed at PB #3
as 6412000520. The point elevation is entered at PB #7 and TOT at PB
#9,

Note that you would have to select the LAT/LONG point data submenu to
enter a minimum en route altitude (MEA). If the spheroid or grid zone
identifier must be changed, the UTM programming submenu is accessed
by pressing PB #8, PROGRAM. The asterisk following PROGRAM
indicates that you are in the UTM programming submenu. The spheroid
is changed by cycling PB #9 until the desired spheroid is displayed. The
grid zone identifier number is changed by typing the number into the
scratchpad and then pressing PB #2. The block identifier letters are
changed by pressing PB #2 (with a clear scratchpad) to move the caret to
the desired letter. Then, press PB #4 to increase or PB #7 to decrease
through the alphabet until the desired letter is displayed (the letters I and
O are not used). Numbers (UTM coordinates or the grid zone numbers)
can be entered (or changed) either on the UTM programming submenu or
the UTM submenu. Letters (spheroid or block identifier letters) can only
be entered (or changed) on the UTM programming submenu.

Programming RNG/BRG and DIR/RNG Data

The UFC RNG/BRG and DIR/RNG submenus (Figure D-5) allow the
aircrew to program sequence points using range and true (not magnetic)
bearing or directional (north/south, east/west—again in true) components
from known sequence points which are already in memory. The known
reference points (from which the RNG/BRG or DIR/RNG components are
applied to identify the geographical position of derived points) were
entered via DTM, list point, or manually utilizing LAT/LONG or UTM
coordinates. When a target is the known point, up to seven TGT offset
(O/S) points can be derived (Figure D-3). Likewise, there can be up to
seven aim points (AIM) derived from a known steer point.

However, if a TGT O/S (or aim point) is the known point, only one
associated TGT point (or steer point) may be derived (Figure D-3). In
either case, the known point may only be displayed in the UTM or
LAT/LONG format while the derived point data may be displayed using
UTM, LAT/LONG, RNG/BRG, or DIR/RNG formats. (Regardless of which
of the four formats is used to define the derived point, once entered, it can
be displayed in any of the four formats.)

Referring to Figure D-4, TGT O/S 8.01A can be entered into the CC using
either range and bearing (RNG/BRG) or directional component and range
(DIR/RNG) from known TGT 8.A. The RNG/BRG and DIR/RNG formats
serve exactly the same purpose and either may be used. However,
DIR/RNG can be programmed more accurately (in feet) than can
RNG/BRG (in tenths of a nm).

In the example, TGT O/S 8.01A is 3.4 nm, bearing 076° true from TGT
8.A. In the same example, TGT O/S 8.01A is 20,156 feet true east and
4850 feet true north from TGT 8.A. TGT O/S 8.01A has an elevation at
1315 feet MSL.

AGR-4 D-6


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_13.jpeg:
RNG/BRG data is programmed by accessing the RNG/BRG point data
submenu. Figure D-5 (left) depicts a typical RNG/BRG format. To
program data, call up the correct TGT O/S point (i.e., 8.01A) by entering
the point identifier in the scratchpad, and pressing PB #1. Then enter the
range, bearing and elevation data. TOTs and MEAs cannot be entered for
offsets or aim points, only for targets and steer points. In the example,
enter 8.01A into PB #1, 3.4 into PB #2, 076 into PB #3, and 1315 into

PB #7. The data for PBs #2, #3 and #7 can be programmed into the UFC
in any order. Remember, the RNG/BRG submenu uses true versus
magnetic bearing, as do the DIR/RNG and UTM point data submenus.

DIR/RNG components can be programmed in a similar manner by
accessing the DIR/RNG submenu. Start by pressing PB #4 in any point
data submenu until the DIR/RNG submenu is displayed (Figure D-5,
right). Then, enter the desired sequence point at PB #1, followed by the
directional components and point elevation in PBs #2, #3 and #7. For the
example in Figure D-4, you enter 8.01A at PB #1, N4850 feet at PB #2,
E20156 feet at PB #3, and 1315 at PB #7. The directional components
and elevation may be input in any order. Remember, the N/S and E/W
direction must be entered in true degrees from the known point (in this
case, TGT 8.A).

D-7 AGR-4


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_14.jpeg:
Once TGT O/S 8.01A is correctly programmed in the RNG/BRG or
DIR/RNG format, it may be displayed in any of the other formats by
pressing PB #4 to cycle to the desired format. When the aircrew
designates TGT O/S 8.01A from the A/G radar or TGT IR, the CC will
provide steering and computed weapons delivery (in A/G master mode) to
TGT 8.A. In later lessons you will learn about the various ways to
designate targets and the weapons employment steering/release cues that
are provided.

You are only able to access the RNG/BRG and DIR/RNG point data
submenus if a derived point syntax (vice a known point syntax) is at PB
#1 on a point data submenu. For example, if you identified target 7. first
(using LAT/LONG or UTMs), the RNG/BRG or DIR/RNG formats would
only be available with 7.01 through 7.07 showing at PB #1. If you enter
the offset first, say 7.01, (using LAT/LONG or UTM's) the RNG/BRG or
DIR/RNG formats are available only with the corresponding target, 7., at
PB #1. The same logic applies to steer points and their associated aim
points.

Data Verification

Before departing on the mission, check sequence point data accuracy. One
technique is to make a list during preflight planning of magnetic bearings
and ranges from the parking ramp to the sequence points defining the
planned route. Unfortunately, the Air Force Mission Support System
(AFMSS) cannot compute this information in the current C3.0 release.
After defining the sequence points, either by data transfer module (DTM)
or UFC, access the UFC Data 1 display (Figure D-6) and compare the
bearing/range displayed at PB #1 to the listed bearings/ranges. By
entering each point you are able to confirm the accuracy of the sequence
point coordinates (commonly called a swing check).

AGR-4 D-8


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_15.jpeg:
Figure D-6 shows a list of sequence points, the bearing and range to each
point, and the Data 1 display, with STR 2A as the current aircraft

sequence point. By comparing the bearing and range at PB #1 to the list,
the geographical accuracy of STR 2A programmed coordinates is verified.

If desired, the HUD information and/or HSI/TEWS NAV data blocks can
be used for this check. (Bearings on the Data 1/Data 2 UFC pages, and
steering on the HUD/ADI and HSI/TEWS are magnetic bearings.) If there
are significant discrepancies between planned and programmed data,
recheck the inputs. You can also verify the point data programming by
stepping through the points on the TSD. Check that all points are
overlaid at the correct location on the moving map, and in the proper
sequence. Compare the “big picture” as shown on the mission charts to
the shape of the route displayed on the TSD.

The above techniques allow you to verify the geographical accuracy for
each sequence point. However, point elevation, MEA and TOT
information are important and should be verified on a UFC point data
submenu.

Last Minute Route/Timing Changes—Programming the New Route
The navigation system accommodates last minute route and/or timing
changes. Suppose that before takeoff the command post calls and changes

the route. The first three points of the old and new route are:

OLD ROUTE NEW ROUTE

STR 1A info 1A is a new point
STR 2A info 2A uses data from list point 27
STR 3A info 3A is the same as old STR 1A

To program the changes, access the point data LAT/LONG submenu
(Figure D-7) and select STR 1A at PB #1. Manually enter the data for the
new STR 1A, and then push PB #1 to step to STR 2A. Copy the point data
from list point 27 to STR 2A by inputting list 27 at PB #10 (Figure D-7).
Point data is saved when either a new point is selected or you exit the
submenu. TOT/MEA data is not part of the list point stored information.
Step to STR 3A. Since point data cannot be transferred from one
sequence point to another, the new data for STR 3A must be entered
manually. If you desire to delete a point, display the sequence point at
PB #1. Enter “0” into the scratchpad, then press PB #1 to clear the
sequence point from CC memory. Deleting a target (or steer point) also
deletes the associated offsets (or aim points). You cannot delete base,
mark points or the current aircraft sequence point. If the aircraft is
currently steering to an offset or aim point, you cannot delete the
associated target or steer point. After modifying the route, verify the new
data by stepping through the TSD points or by performing a swing check.

If you want to change a steer point to a target (7A to 7.A) or vice versa,
you can do so on the point data submenus. Simply enter the new syntax
(sequence point and optional letter) through the scratchpad into PB #1.
The aim points/offsets associated with the previous point will be modified
to reflect the syntax of the new point (e.g., target offsets will be changed to
aim points when the target is changed to a steer point and vice versa).

NOTE

The base point cannot be changed, and a designated target cannot be
changed to a steer point (more in future lessons on designations).

AGR-4 D-10


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_17.jpeg:
On the point data submenu, (Figure D-7) you can cycle PB #1 through all
sequence points of a particular route (the points cycle in numerical order).
To look at a sequence point of a different route, enter it through the
scratchpad (including the route identifier). Once entered, cycle through
all the sequence points reflecting the new route. To change from base,
mark, 0. or bullseye enter a new point through the scratchpad, including
the route identifier. To review mark points, enter a mark point (M1
through M10) at PB #1, and cycle PB #1 through the 10 mark points (in
numerical order). Review bullseye points in the same manner (B1
through B10).

Figure D - 7.

TOTs can be entered using a missionized DTM or manually on the UFC
point data submenu (or on the UFC data 2 display). There are no TOTs
associated with list points; so, if route points are defined via list points,
TOTs for those points must be manually programmed.

If TOT OFF is displayed at PB #9 (any UFC point data submenu format),
you can enter a TOT through the scratchpad for the associated sequence
point (PB #1). TOTs for other sequence points are not affected. If a TOT
is already displayed (for example TOT 09:00:00), entering a new TOT
changes the PB #9 TOT, but it also changes all other TOTs on that route
by the difference between the old and new TOT. Therefore, to change one
TOT and leave all other TOTs unaffected, use UFC Data 2 rather than a
UFC point data submenu. All TOTs on a particular route can also be

D-11 AGR-4


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_18.jpeg:
changed using the Delta TOT capability. The DELTA TOT format is
selected by pressing PB #9 with a blank scratchpad next to any TOT on
the point data submenu. If "TOT OFF" is displayed at PB #9, the DELTA
TOT format is unavailable.

From the Delta TOT format, positive or negative values (shift - on the key
pad) entered through the scratchpad and PB #9 will be added to, or
subtracted from, all sequence point TOTs on the route. Valid Delta TOT
entries are from 1 second to 28 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds.
Trailing zeros are assumed (leading zeros are required). For example,
entering “1” to a 10:00:00 TOT would change the TOT to 20:00:00 and add
10 hours to all other TOTs on that route.

USE OF UFC DATA 2

Data 2 is utilized to display information concerning fuel remaining,
ETE/ETA, TOT/TOA and required groundspeed to make a particular TOT.
The above information can be displayed relative to sequence points (steer
points, targets, and base only) as selected by the aircrew.

The information on the first two lines is relative to the line of sight (LOS)
point. The information is valid only if you fly direct to the LOS point
displayed at PB #1. The following applies: (Refer to Figure D-8)

PB #1 - you may enter (through the scratchpad) any steer point
(including base) or target that is stored in the CC, but the SP
identifier number must be equal to or greater than the current
aircraft sequence point. Toggling PB #1 will sequentially step
through subsequent steer points and targets on the displayed route
(A,B,C). If you wish to change the displayed route (A,B,C), simply use
the scratchpad to display any steer point or target on the desired
route. The point at PB #1 does not affect current sequence point
steering (i.e., steering on the TEWS, HUD, ADI, HSI or the points
displayed on the A/A radar, A/G radar, or TSD).

PB #2 shows current aircraft groundspeed (the same as displayed on
UFC Data 1 and on the HUD/ADI if groundspeed is selected from
Data 1 for HUD/ADI display). PB #10 may be cycled to alternately
display fuel remaining or bearing/range information. Both reflect
flying directly to the LOS point at PB #1, and the fuel is computed at
current throttle setting, fuel flow, and current GS (reflected at PB #2).
PB #9 may be cycled to alternately display ETE or ETA to the LOS
point, again based on the current groundspeed at PB #2.

Lines 3 and 4 display information relative to a look ahead point. Display
of the look ahead steer point (including BASE) or target at PB #3 follows
the same logic as display of the LOS point at PB #1 (e.g., scratchpad entry
or toggling). You cannot enter a look ahead point that is earlier on the
route than the LOS point.

Cycling either PB #4, PB #7, or PB #8 alternately displays two sets of
information for the 3 PBs (i.e., if you push any of the three PBs, you
change the information displayed at all three.) The two sets are:

1. PB#4: CG (no number); PB #8: fuel figure in pounds; and
PB #7: TOA.
or

2. PB#4: CG (followed by a number); PB #8 “FUEL REM”; and
PB #7 TOT.

The significance of this information is that if you proceed directly to the
LOS point and then fly the programmed route until reaching the look
ahead point (PB #3) at the command groundspeed (PB #4), you will arrive
at the look ahead point at your preselected TOT (PB #7) with the fuel
displayed at PB #8. All computations (fuels, times, and speeds) are based
on flying the bank angle selected on the TSD.

Do not associate look ahead point fuel remaining (PB #8) or TOA (PB #7)
with command groundspeed. They are applicable only at current
groundspeed (PB #2). Obviously, if your current groundspeed is the same
as command groundspeed then the fuel is applicable to both (and
TOT/TOA will read the same). Remember that look ahead point fuel
remaining assumes that the current fuel flow and ground speed will
remain constant.

If you want to put everything in sync, check the command groundspeed
(PB #4) required to make the TOT (PB #7). Accelerate/ decelerate to make
the current groundspeed (PB #2) match the command groundspeed. Only
then should you check the look ahead fuel figure and TOA. With matched
command and current ground speeds, TOA/TOT (cycle PB #7) are the
same.

An analog command velocity “wiper” is displayed to the left of the HUD
calibrated airspeed window (Figure D-9) (if the gear handle is up, a TOT
has been entered for the current route and the CC clock has been set).
This “wiper” rotates up or down from a horizontal position to indicate the
difference between the current speed and command velocity (CMD VEL)
to meet the next TOT on the current route. The right side of the wiper
points down (slow down) or up (speed up) at a maximum angle of +80° (1°
per knot for a maximum of 80 knots). A horizontal “wiper” indicates the
current speed will achieve the next TOT on the current route.

All aircraft displayed ETEs, ETAs and command speeds are computed
assuming you will turn (using the bank angle selected on the TSD) to
steer directly to the current aircraft steer point/target, and then fly the
route in numerical sequence. Computations are based on turns initiated
over each point (no lead turns). Remember this when flight planning: to
ensure the most accurate aircraft displayed information, always select
coordinates for the exact point at which you plan to begin your turn.

TOTs can be entered on the point data submenu or on Data 2. Entering
(or changing) a TOT on either of these UFC formats also changes that
TOT on the other format. Remember, TOTs changed on UFC Data 2
affect only the TOT assigned to the look ahead point. They do not adjust
other route TOTs like a changed TOT entry does on the UFC point data
submenus.

D-15 AGR-4


Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_22.jpeg:
CMD speed on the HUD/ADI may be different from the CG displayed on
Data 2 (Figure D-10, right). The HUD/ADI command speed is always to
the next assigned TOT on the current aircraft route. The DATA 2, CMD
GS may be to any point with an assigned TOT, even to a point on a
different route (A,B,C) than the one you are currently flying. Additionally,
the HUD/ADI information is based on flying direct to the current aircraft
sequence point. The UFC Data 2 information is based on flying direct to
the LOS point (which may or may not be the same as the current aircraft
sequence point).

EN ROUTE CUTOFFS, CHANGES

To cut off a portion of the route, decide which point(s) to cut off. Select
Data 2 (Figure D-11) and enter the next desired LOS point at PB #1. For
example, to check fuel, BRG/RNG and timing from near STR 2A direct to
STR 4A (cutting off sequence point 3A), enter STR 4A at PB #1 and TGT
6.A at PB #3. The UFC displays the current GS, ETE or ETA, and either
bearing and range or fuel remaining from your present position, direct to
STR 4A at current GS and fuel flow. Bearing/range or fuel remaining is
cycled by pressing PB #10. ETE/ETA is cycled by pressing PB #9.

With the look ahead point (TGT 6.A) displayed at PB #3, the CMD GS to
achieve the programmed TOT (cutting off sequence point 3A) can be
displayed at PB #4. The TOT/TOA to the look ahead point is displayed at
PB #7, and “FUEL REM” or the estimated fuel remaining is displayed at
PB #8. The fuel figures are based on turning direct to STR 4A, then flying
to the remaining points along the route to the look ahead point, 6.A, at
current groundspeed, fuel flow and TSD-selected bank turns. The LOS
point (at PB #1) and the look ahead point (at PB #3) must be steer, target
or base points. These actions performed on the Data 2 page do not affect
HUD/ADI/HSI/TEWS steering or HUD/ADI command velocity. To steer
direct to STR 4A, enter STR 4A at PB #10 on Menu 1 or Data 1 to display
HUD/ADI/HSI/TEWS steering information and HUD/ADI command
velocity to 4A (assuming a TOT is assigned to 4A, otherwise the command
velocity will be to the next point on the route that has been assigned a
TOT).

Alternate Routes

The CC can store up to 365 points (99 list points, 100 steer points/targets,
100 aim points/offsets, 10 mark points, base, 10 bullseye points, and 45
avoidance points) for en route use and including alternate routes. Routes
with A, B, or C suffixes can be stored during preflight operations,
providing excellent tactical flexibility. For the following example (Figure
D-12), assume a priority target must be struck at a precise TOT,
regardless of weather, threats, or other factors. Preflight planning,
therefore, includes routes A, B, and C with the same TOT and target (8.A,
8.B, and 7.C, respectively). Route A is the primary route; B and C are
alternate routes. The crew ingresses via route A, and passes STR 1A and
STR 2A. At STR 3A, it is apparent the weather ahead is not acceptable.
The crew enters the next feasible alternate route point (STR 5B) into the
LOS point at PB #1 on Data 2. The next route B point with a TOT then
automatically appears at PB #3 (TGT 8.B in this case). The CC computes
LOS range and bearing, ETE, ETA, and fuel remaining from present
position to STR 5B and displays this data at PBs #9 and #10. The CC
displays TOT/TOA, command groundspeed, and fuel remaining at TGT
8.B (via direct to STR 5B). After viewing this data, the crew decides to go
direct to STR 5B, then continue to the TGT on route B. To go direct to
STR 5B, they enter STR 5B at PB #10 on Data 1 or Menu 1 and achieve
STR 5B steering on the HUD/ADI/HSI/TEWS. They will probably want to
select route B on the TSD as well.

toward route C (Figure D-13). No problem. Data 2 provides alternate
routing information. The aircrew enters the nearest feasible route C point
(STR 6C) at PB #10 on Data 1 (or Menu 1). This provides immediate
steering direct to the new IP (STR 6C) and to the same target (TGT 7.C)
via the IP to TGT run from STR 6C to TGT 7.C.

Text from AGR-4_Navigation_page_26.jpeg:
Weather and SAMs have forced the aircrew to fly a longer route than
planned. Evasive maneuvers used more fuel than expected. To check fuel
remaining at the base via TGT 7.C, they select TGT 7.C at PB #1 and B
(base) at PB #3 on Data 2 (Figure D-14, left). Flying present position
direct to TGT 7.C then home, they would RTB with 1200 lbs. Note that
their actual fuel remaining should be higher (barring battle damage or
afterburner use) because dropping their ordnance will decrease their drag
index; in addition, they should be able (once in friendly territory) to climb
to a more efficient cruising altitude and perform an en route descent.
After the strike at TGT 7.C, they select B at PB #10 on Data 1 (or Menu 1)
for immediate steering home (Figure D-14, right).

The previous example shows some poor technique in the aircrews’ flight
planning. It is generally advisable to make the IP and target point
numbers match between the A, B and C routes. The C route IP should
have been loaded as 7C and the target as 8.C-this is much easier to
remember, and auto sequencing will function normally from 5C to 7C.
This also helps in the drawing of offset predictions, which may be shared
between 8.A, 8.B and 8.C.

The zero point (0.) target feature allows the aircrew to visually overfly a
point and get steering and weapons delivery computations to a TGT that
is at a known location relative to the point. The target syntax must be 0.

Either DIR/RNG or RNG/BRG UFC formats can be used. In preflight
planning, choose a visual point near the target as a backup in case other
delivery options are not viable. For example, using an old airplane at the
10,000 feet marker on the run-in to a range nuclear target (Figure D-15)
as the visual point, the following steps are used to program a 0. target in
the DIR/RNG format (0. data can also be entered in RNG/BRG format,
although this is less accurate than the DIR/RNG format).

magnetic.

PROGRAMMING AND CHECKING NAVIGATION DATA

Latitude and longitude data for sequence points (SP) is entered on the
point data LAT/LONG submenu (Figure D-1) as you practiced during the
INS lesson. There are three additional UFC submenus available for
defining sequence points to the CC.

The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), range and bearing
(RNG/BRG), and directional components and range (DIR/RNG) point data
submenus provide additional flexibility for programming the various
sequence points used in low level/surface attack missions.

Programming Data as UTMs

The UTM is a grid system used to define specific points or areas in a
manner similar to LAT/LONGs. The UTMs consist of a spheroid identifier
that designates a part of the world containing the point. The eight
spheroids are: INTL (International), BESSEL, CLARKE-66, CLARKE-80,
EVEREST, AUST NAT (Australian National), WGS 72 and, WGS 84 (the
aircraft initializes to WGS 84). Within the spheroid are alpha numeric
grid zone identifiers (the southwest corner of a 10,000 meter square block,
e.g., 12 SUL) which provide a specific starting point for the UTM
coordinates. A series of numbers express the point location, in meters,
east and north of the grid zone identifier. UTMs are always read from the
lower left hand corner (southwest corner) of the grid zone to the right
(east) and up (north).

The easiest way to access UTM data is to define the sequence point using
LAT/LONG on the LAT/LONG submenu, then press PB #4, UTM (Figure
D-2) to display the previously entered LAT/LONG data as UTM data on
the UTM submenu. Similarly, if you define sequence points in the UTM
format, the CC performs the conversion and you can display the
information in the LAT/LONG format.

NOTE

The identifier at UFC Point Data Submenu, PB #4, identifies the next
format (LAT/LONG, UTM, RNG/BRG, or DIR/RNG) that will be called

up if the button is pushed. It does NOT identify the currently
displayed format.

Select offsets close enough to course line for a minimum of 0.5° graze
angle. Clutter environments, such as wooded hills, provide unique
problems. A very simple problem commonly overlooked when planning
radar offsets is the presence of 50-foot trees around the desired offset or
aim point. This additional obstacle boosts the altitude required to map
the intended point so an alternate point may be required. The following
diagram demonstrates the linear relationship used to compute the
altitude required for line of sight (LOS) to a point (Figure D-2).

HOW HIGH DOES THE AIRCRAFT HAVE TO BE (Y') TO HAVE LOS TO THE TARGET?

Text from AGR-5_Sensor_Planning_page_11.jpeg:
Practical Problem

Several methods are available for determining the proper squint angle
and graze angle. Figure D-3 demonstrates the first technique for aim
point planning.

By marking the left and right 30° and 50° scribes on a plotter (Figure D-3)
and sliding it along your course line (referencing the 90°/270° scribe), you
can determine the point on the course line with acceptable squint angle.
Move the plotter along the course line so the desired offset is positioned
within the marks. Make a mark through the hole in the plotter on the
course line. Measure the distance to the current steer point; this is the
distance from the turn point to start mapping (17.5 nm in Figure D-8).
During tactical maneuvers, you may be right or left of the planned course
or on a slightly different heading. Therefore, plan your offset/aim point
for flexibility.

Text from AGR-5_Sensor_Planning_page_14.jpeg:
To minimize A/G radar time, another option is “Interleaved” PVU (IPVU)
time at PB #16 on the A/G radar. However, the IPVU option has several
disadvantages. It occurs even if MAP FREEZE is selected, and disables
the A/A radar without doing a “sanity” check (it will accept any value).
Also, the IPVU option will not work effectively if velocity errors are
unusually large (over 5 to 6 knots). Also, the aircrew has no way of
checking this information. (IPVU is a MN PVU, but for consistency, we
define PVU as a MN PVU not using the interleaved option.)

Text from AGR-5_Sensor_Planning_page_18.jpeg:
Now that the offset is selected and the mapping point is determined, it is
important to accurately predict how the offset will appear on the display.
Patch maps are generated relative to the line of sight to the point and
presented in the cockpit as if they were straight ahead. Interpreting the
correct aim point is often confusing. Patch map predictions should be
drawn depicting the proper orientation of the scene at the proposed squint
angles. Planning materials need to include a map that depicts forest
shapes and well-defined tree lines. European AFCENT 1:250,000 depict
forestation well, but this is a serious planning limitation in the CONUS
unless imagery is available for mission planning. If using AFMSS
imagery for planning, make sure you apply the right scale. An imagery
print out with .5x scale selected has the same scale as a 1:50,000 map (as
seen in Figure D-8). So you can use the templates described in Figure D-6
for radar footprint predictions. The NAV shops in your squadrons might
also have some overlays that you can use for AFMSS printout predictions.

Another consideration during A/G radar mission planning is selecting the
appropriate size display window. If the mission navigator is updated
regularly and system drift is small, a 1.3 display window may be
acceptable. If the mission navigator has drifted significantly, a 3.3 display
window is probably required. Always work big-to-small to a .67 map for
best designation detail.

The display window template in Figure D-6 is useful for making radar
predictions. The template for the 1:250,000 scale is primarily for area
orientation when selecting aim points. The easiest way to use the display
window template for offset orientation is to place the template on the map
so the line of sight reference on the template runs from the aircraft
position during mapping (on the course line) to the feature being mapped,
as in Figure D-9.

A/G Radar Pacing

In addition to planning when and where to begin A/G radar duties, it is
important to address radar time-sharing. The radar is used primarily in
the A/A mode. If the A/A radar setup is RWSI, 80 mile range, 120°
azimuth scan and six-bar elevation scan, allow 20 to 25 seconds to get
adequate area coverage. At 40 miles the radar will be searching an area
80 miles wide and 16,000 feet high. This time allows two complete frames
and should detect potential threats. In 25 seconds you will travel about

4 miles, so sanitize the area prior to A/G radar operations. Now examine
the time required to complete the update process:

| A Oe 20 sec
2 & patch MAPS... eeeeeeeeeseessssessesstssssssesseteeees 10 sec
FOS, Tipe, GST UG ec sce see see see see eee eee eee see 10 sec
Switch actuation ...........cceececeeeeceeecceeccescceeeceueees 03 sec
Total A/G time ..............ccceeeeeeeeeesssesssessesseseeeeeees 43 sec

At 480 knots the aircraft has traveled roughly 6 nm during this period of
updating the MN. If the previous 10 minutes of the low level was
dedicated to A/A search, the odds are the entire tactical situation has not
changed significantly in the last 43 seconds. This is not to say, however,
that an update should be performed on every leg of the low level or that
the WSO should spend 5 minutes watching the RBM display sweep back
and forth. As a minimum, at least one update should be accomplished just
prior to the IP.

However, it is important to keep in mind that a bandit traveling at a
comparable speed could have flown 6 nm for a total of 12 nm closure
during this time. If your last search was on a 40 nm scope, the bandit
could be at 28 miles, perhaps close to fox 1 range (for the bandit) before
you have even resumed your radar search. That is why it is important to
plan mapping opportunities to reduce A/G radar time to a minimum.
Using IPVU also reduces A/G radar time by 10-15 seconds, with very little
reduction in accuracy.

If using EGI as PPKS, subtract 20 seconds or 3 miles from above times
and distances, which enhances your own tactical situation.

Now that all mission planning is complete, it is time to gather all the bits

organize the information into a useful form. Pilots and WSOs normally
have different areas of interest when constructing stick maps. For
example, pilots are probably more concerned with basic navigation,
turnpoint descriptions, MSAs, ATC requirements, master mode selection
and the attack itself. WSOs normally annotate radar update points, radar
predictions, TGT IR update points and air-to-air search duties, as well as
navigation data and the attack. There is nothing wrong with both crew
members having identical stick maps, but we each have our own
techniques for depicting the desired information. Figure D-12 shows an
example of a stick map. The primary purpose of the stick map is to help
develop a sense of pacing and to remind the crew to perform assigned
tasks during the mission (radar updates, targeting pod updates, air-to-air
search, PACS selection, master mode selection, master arm on, attack
parameters, etc.). These tasks are relatively easy to remember when
flying local sorties on familiar low levels to familiar ranges. However,
confusion increases when flying from an unfamiliar base with peculiar
ATC procedures, marginal weather, darkness, a first-look low level and
tactical targets on an unfamiliar range. Throw in a couple of display
problems and a few marginal systems and the workload increases beyond
belief.

CONCLUSION

Using the techniques mentioned should help organize mission planning
tasks and effectively employ both crew members. There are times when
the situation dictates a deviation from the plan, but the most important
points to remember are that both crew members know the plan and
adhere to it as much as possible. Thorough and accurate mission planning
is the key to effective crew coordination and successful employment of the
F-15E.

TEXT
INTRODUCTION

This lesson is designed to be a practical application of what you learned in
AGR-2 (APG-70 A/G Introduction). It is important to have a thorough
understanding of mission planning considerations to employ the F-15E
sensors properly.

HIGH RESOLUTION MAP (HRM) PLANNING

The synthetic aperture process requires very constrained parameters.
The accuracy of radar maps improves as the angle off the nose (squint
angle) gets larger (to the 60° radar gimbal limit). Maps taken between
30° and 50° provide reasonable accuracy and a gimble margin. The
accuracy and quality of the patch map are also determined by velocity
errors. MN precision velocity updates (PVU) are recommended prior to
patch maps even if an INS PVU was performed.

PVU Planning After TO 1F-15E-737 [Embedded Global Positioning
Inertial Navigation System (EGI)]

Best available velocity is based on the present position keeping source
(PPKS). In EGI PPKS, the best available velocity is the position velocity
consistency (PVC) filter velocity. This velocity is used by the radar for the
construction of high resolution maps. The requirement for a MN PVU
before constructing a patch map is not necessary if using EGI as the
PPKS.

D-1 AGR-5


Text from AGR-5_Sensor_Planning_page_8.jpeg:
The importance of having accurate velocities for HRM mapping is
illustrated in Figure D-1. On a 0.67 nm map made at 10 nm range, 540
kts and 20° squint, a 0.5 ft/sec velocity error results in a 100-foot
positional error. When the velocity error is increased to 1.0 ft/sec, the
positional error increases to 200 feet. You should also note in Figure D-1
that velocity errors are lessened considerably as the squint angles near
the aircraft limit of 60° off the nose. Additionally, you can see why the
aircraft prohibits mapping within 8° of the nose, where even small velocity
errors translate into very large positional errors. Velocity errors of 0.3
knots induce unacceptable position errors and result in display array
shading, which may obscure the desired aim point.

Text from AGR-5_Sensor_Planning_page_9.jpeg:
Map quality is further reduced by low graze angles. At a 500 feet AGL
ingress altitude, the offset/target must be within 2.5 nm, which is actually
too close to map. Experience shows that good quality maps can be made
with graze angles slightly less than 0.5°, which allows mapping out to

10 nm from as low as 500 feet AGL. As the graze angle decreases,
selection of aim points and offsets becomes increasingly important. At
minimum graze angles, it is important to select aim points that are
vertically developed (such as buildings, small peaks, etc.), distinctively
shaped, and preferably associated with radar no-show areas such as
roads, rivers and runways.

These radar constraints dictate a limited window for tactical employment.
The 1:60 rule could prove to be very costly if you fly at 1500 feet AGL,

15 nm from the target area in a “here I am” maneuver after spending the
past 40 minutes at 200 feet trying to remain undetected. As a general
guideline for planning, aim points and offset points should be within

10 nm of course, 30° to 50° off the nose, not obscured by intervening
terrain, and have particular physical characteristics as described earlier.
RBM offset points, such as small peaks, can be on the nose and are
relatively accurate.

Penetration Bombs

These bombs are designed to penetrate and explode inside a hard target
such as a concrete bunker. They are built with heavy cases and are
designed to counter break-up. The explosive charge is approximately
25 to 30% of the total weight. The BLU-109/B Penetrator bomb is an
example of a penetrating weapon.

Demolition Bombs

In demolition bombs, the explosive weight equals approximately 65 to 80%
of the total weight. These bombs have a relatively thin-walled casing to
maximize blast effect, while penetration and fragmentation effects are
limited. Demolition bombs are designed for a higher blast effect than a
GP bomb of comparable weight. The 3000 pound M118 and 15,000 pound
BLU-82 are examples of this type.

Fragmentation Bombs

As the name implies, these bombs are intended to disperse and project
high-velocity fragments. The fragments are the principal damage
mechanism of the weapons, with blast effects being a secondary
consideration. The charge to total weight ratio varies from 10 to 20%.
There are no bombs (unitary warheads) in the inventory designed
specifically for fragmentation, although GP bombs do produce a relatively
good fragmentation effect when used with a proximity fuze (air burst).
Cluster bomb unit (CBU) munitions are more commonly used as
fragmentation weapons.

Explosive Filler

The most common explosive filler is called Tritonal. It is a mix of TNT
and aluminum in a ratio of 80:20. H6 is also a commonly used explosive
filler. Both are less sensitive to electronic sparks than TNT or Tetryl
booster charges. The US Navy uses PBXN-109 onboard ships, since even
Tritonal and H6 are too sensitive to be used in the close confines of the
ship.

WEAPON COMPONENTS

GP bombs are cylindrical in shape and are equipped with conical fins or
retarders for external high speed carriage. They are built for both nose
and tail fuzes to ensure reliability and to cause the desired bomb effects.
All GP bombs are similar in construction. The bomb body (Figure D-1)
contains the high explosive, charging well and suspension lugs. Other
parts added to make a complete munition are adapter boosters, fin
assembly, arming wires and fuzes.

Text from AGW-1_General_Purpose_Bombs_page_14.jpeg:
The suspension lugs are screwed into the top of the bomb and are used for
carriage. Bombs weighing less than 2000 pounds are equipped with

14 inch suspension lugs. Bombs, like the MK 84, that are in the

2000 pounds class and above are equipped with 30 inch suspension lugs.

Adapter boosters are required when mechanical fuzes are used since the
mechanical fuze, by itself, is not powerful enough to detonate the main
charge of the bomb. The boosters are inside the bomb or fuze well and are
not visible. The explosive used in the booster charge is more sensitive
than the explosive filler it is used to detonate.

The fin assembly is attached to the bomb to stabilize it in flight and
ensure proper ballistic trajectory. Look for damage to the assembly
during preflight.

A charging well is connected to the nose and tail fuze wells and is located
just aft of the forward suspension lug. It is usually closed with a threaded
plug that must be removed for installation of an initiator and braided
steel arming cables or lanyards that are used with some fuzes. The steel
cables or lanyards are threaded through the conduits inside the bomb and
extend out of the top of the charging well for attachment to the
appropriate point for fuze arming.

AGW-1 D-8


Text from AGW-1_General_Purpose_Bombs_page_15.jpeg:
External arming wires (Figure D-2) are installed on bomb type munitions
to allow the bomb to be released armed or safe. Arming wire routing
varies depending upon what type of munition is used.

For some GP bombs, one end of the nose fuze arm wire is secured to the
aft lug, and the tail fuze arm wire is attached to the front lug. These
wires are then inserted through an arming swivel loop and then through
the opposite suspension lug. This system allows the arming wires to
remain with the bomb and not damage the aircraft following release.

The arming wire swivel loops are inserted into the proper arming
solenoids for cockpit selectable arming. When the weapon separates from
the aircraft, the selected solenoids (nose or tail, or nose and tail) hold the

swivel loops, pulling the arming wire(s) from the fuze(s), thus allowing
them to spin arm.

General Purpose Bombs

MK 82 LDGP Bomb

The MK 82 low drag general purpose (LDGP) bomb (Figure D-5) has a
slender metal body designed to produce minimum drag. The bomb weighs
531 pounds with 192 pounds of explosive. The bomb produces blast,
fragmentation and cratering. Its main function is determined by the
fuze(s) and fuze components with which it was armed. The MK 82 bomb
is used with proximity, mechanical, or electrical fuzes; however, the
mechanical fuze is most common. The bomb may use a nose or tail fuze or
both to increase the functional reliability. If the bomb is tail fuzed only, a
nose fuze plug must be inserted in the nose cavity to prevent collapse upon
high speed impact with a hard surface. This aids penetration of hard
targets and increases the cratering effect. The MK 82 LDGP uses the
conical fins consisting of an elongated fin cone and four streamlined blades
assembled perpendicular to the cone. The fin cone accepts the ATU-35 tail
fuze drive assembly for a mechanical tail fuze.

MK 82 Air Inflatable Retarder (AIR) HDGP Bomb

The MK 82 AIR is a MK 82 bomb with a BSU-49/B AIR tail assembly
installed (Figure D-6). The AIR provides a high-speed (200-700 KCAS)
low altitude delivery capability by use of bomb retardation. This increases
bomb trail and reduces the danger of the aircraft being hit by fragments.
The probability of bomb ricochet is reduced by increased impact angles
while increasing bomb effectiveness against frag/blast sensitive targets.

LOW-DRAG CONFIGURATION

AGW-01-06

Figure D - 6. MK 82 AIR.

The BSU-49 AIR tail assembly consists of a low drag (LD) stabilizer
canister unit, a ballute (balloon/parachute) retarder, and retarder release
lanyard assembly. The stabilizer canister acts as a container for the
ballute and provides aerodynamic stability during carriage and low drag
delivery. The lanyard assembly is used to initiate the release of the base
plate and subsequent ballute deployment for a high drag (HD) release.
Airloads open the baseplate withdrawing the ballute until airflow through
the inlets inflate it.

The MK 82 AIR can be released in either the HD configuration (ballute
deploys after release) or in the LD configuration (ballute remains stowed).

The release configuration is determined by arming wire/lanyard routing
and may be cockpit selectable.

MK 84 LDGP

The MK 84 LD bomb is a GP bomb that weighs 1972 pounds with

945 pounds of explosive. Its fuzing and functioning are the same as the
MK 82, but it has better penetration and cratering effects because of its
size. The conical fin assembly is much like that of the MK 82 LDGP.

MK 84 AIR HDGP Bomb

The MK 84 AIR HDGP bomb is a MK 84 GP bomb that is modified by
attaching a BSU-50/B AIR tail assembly. The BSU-50/B components and
assembly are similar to the BSU-49/B AIR. The operation of the two
munitions is identical. The BSU-50/B AIR assembly provides the
capability to deliver the MK 84 at airspeeds not exceeding 700 KCAS.
Again, check the external stores limitations in chapter 5 of the Dash 1 to
verify aircraft limitations that may be more restrictive.

The BSU-50/B retarder is only 12% larger than the BSU-49/B, but the
MK 84 is four times heavier than the MK 82. This increase in weapon
mass, coupled with a small increase in ballute size, forces a higher
delivery airspeed for proper G forces to be sensed by the fuze.

If the BSU-50/B is used with a live unit FMU retard sensing fuze,
deceleration forces required to initiate fuze arming determine minimum
release airspeeds. Minimum release airspeeds for HD employment are
fuze dependent:

e FMU-54/B - 550 KCAS
e FMU-54A/B~ - 550 KCAS
e FMU-139A/B - 450 KCAS

These delivery airspeeds are critical to ensure fuze function criteria is met
and fuzes arm when required.

BLU-109/B Penetrator Bomb

This bomb, also referred to as an I-2000, is in the 2000-pound class and
has enhanced penetration capability against hard targets (Figure D-7).
Improvements include: no nose fuze well, increased bomb wall strength,
and a stronger tail fuze assembly. It contains 550 pounds of explosive and
uses an FMU-143/B internal tail fuze. The FZU-32B/B initiator is
installed in the charging well of the bomb and provides electrical power by
an air scoop turbine generator to arm the fuze at release. The bomb aft
section is compatible with MK 84 tail assemblies, but the BLU-109 is most
commonly used in the GBU-15, the GBU-24A/B low-level laser guided
bomb (LLLGB) or the AGM-130C missile.

FUZES

No weapon is of much value unless there is some way of controlling it.
There must be some manner to store, load and carry munitions in a safe
condition yet have them detonate at the desired time. A fuze is used to
accomplish these tasks. Therefore, there are normally two settings
associated with each fuze.

Fuze Arm Time

Fuze arm time is the time it takes for the fuze to reach an armed condition
after release. It provides safe clearance to the crew and aircraft by
preventing a premature detonation. The distance the weapon is from the
aircraft at fuze arm time is safe separation.

Function Setting

The function setting controls what conditions must be met for a munition
to function as it is supposed to. It may be set for an air burst, or after the
weapon has hit or penetrated a target. This will vary depending on the
desired weapon effect.

Methods of Arming

Vane

The arming vane is a small propeller that is rotated by airflow after
weapon release as the munition falls. When the vane has rotated the
required number of times, the fuze is armed. Special gears compensate for
variations in release airspeeds.

Pin

The arming pin is ejected or withdrawn by spring action when the weapon
is released. The ejection of the pin releases the arming mechanism and
allows the fuze to arm.

Inertia

The inertia fuze is armed by an abrupt change in the velocity or
deceleration of the weapon by deploying fins or ballutes.

AGW-1 D-18


Text from AGW-1_General_Purpose_Bombs_page_25.jpeg:
Electric

An electrical-arming fuze may be armed by a thermal battery, an air
turbine alternator, or an air scoop generator that is activated at bomb
release by the extraction of a lanyard.

Methods of Functioning

A fuze functions by one of the following methods:

Impact

Impact fuzes are initiated when they strike a sufficiently dense material.
These fuzes may function instantaneously or after a delay set for
microseconds or even days.

Proximity

The proximity fuze is a miniature doppler radar altimeter. The fuze
transmits radar waves that are reflected back to the fuze by the target.
When the lag time between transmission and reception reaches a set
value, the fuze functions. This lag time has been precomputed and
translated into selectable burst height values in altitude above the target.
Burst height values vary among different fuzes.

Time
In a time fuze, the delay is initiated at bomb release and not at the

instant of impact. The time element is obtained by a mechanical or
electrical device.

Hydrostatic

Hydrostatic fuzes are employed in depth bombs for underwater demolition
work. They are not addressed in this lesson.

Classification

Fuzes for conventional weapons are classified by their location in the
munition. Fuzes are located in the nose and/or tail of the weapon. The
distinction between these locations (Figure D-8) is important because of
the differences in sensitivity to impact and because of the directional effect
on fragmentation.

D-19 AGW-1

Nose

The nose fuze is frequently a fuze that functions on impact. A properly
adjusted fuze can be sensitive enough to be initiated by impact with the
softest of material. A nose fuze tends to deflect sidewall fragments away
from the nose of the bomb. If your target is troops in the open, you want
maximum frag effect, produced by bombs with nose or proximity fuzes.
This results in more fragmentation deflection above ground level where
your target is located. Nose fuzes are also used to open CBU canisters or
to create an air burst affect.

AGW-01-08

Figure D - 8. Fuze Classification.
Tail

Tail fuzes can have more than one function (Figure D-8). They can
function on their own or provide a redundancy to the nose fuze to increase
overall munition reliability. The tail fuze is normally set to detonate a
short time after initial impact. When used alone, this allows the bomb to
penetrate the target prior to detonation. To aid this penetration, the tail
fuze tends to deflect the fragmentation away from the tail of the bomb.
The tail fuze is used against harder targets or when cratering is the
desired effect.

Specific Fuzes

M904 Nose Fuze

The M904 is a mechanical impact nose fuze (Figure D-9) used in

GP bombs. The fuze uses an arming vane to arm. Arming begins when
the arming wire is withdrawn from the vane, allowing it to spin in the
airstream. For airspeeds from 150 to 600 knots, the arming time is
independent of airspeed. This is accomplished by use of a mechanical
governor and a constant speed arming gear train.

Figure D - 9. M904 Nose Fuze.

Arming delay times are set on a calibrated dial on the front of the fuze.
To set a delay time of less than 6 seconds, the stop set screw must be
removed. The selectable arming delay times for the M904E1 fuze are: 4,
6, 8, 12 or 20 seconds. Times have a tolerance of +20%. For the M904E2
or E3, delay times range from 2 to 18 seconds in 2 second increments with
a tolerance of +10%.

The positive tolerance must be used to determine the minimum release
altitude to ensure fuze arming prior to impact. For example, for an
M904E2 fuze, if an arming time of 4 seconds is set, the longest it may take
the fuze to arm is 4.4 seconds (4.0 +.4). The time of flight for this weapon
should be at least this value or the fuze may dud. The shortest time it

may take to arm is 3.6 seconds; this time must be considered for safe
escape should the bomb detonate at the end of arming time.

Function delay times are achieved by inserting a delay element behind the
firing pin. This is accomplished by munitions personnel. The delay times
are: instantaneous, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.10 or 0.25 seconds. If you note any
red in the warning window during preflight do not touch the fuze, contact
the munition specialist.

M905 Tail Fuze

The M905 tail fuze is a mechanical impact tail fuze commonly used with
GP bombs. Fuze arming begins when the arming wire is withdrawn from
the vane tab of the ATU-35 fuze drive assembly (Figure D-10). This
assembly provides the rotational force required to arm the tail fuze just as
the vane spin arms the M904 nose fuze.

FMU-54 Tail Fuze

The FMU-54 is a mechanically operated, retardation sensing tail fuze. It
has two versions, the FMU-54/B (Figure D-12) and the FMU-54A/B
(Figure D-13). They can be used with the MK 82 AIR and the MK 84 AIR.
As the fuze is not visible after installation in the bomb, all settings must
be made before installation.

FMU-54/B:

When the bomb is released, the fuze arming lanyard is
pulled, initiating the arming time delay (selectable from
0.75 to 3.50 seconds in 0.25 increments). The fuze must
sense a force of 3.5 +0.5 G for 0.6 seconds in order to
function. This is provided by the bomb's retardation device
functioning. If retardation is lost during the 0.6 seconds
(retardation device failure), the fuze should not arm. Note:
BSU-49 failure, however, can result in an armed munition.
To achieve the required G force for arming, minimum
delivery airspeed must be greater than 330 KCAS for the
MK 82 ATR and 550 KCAS for the MK 84 AIR. The fuze
functions at impact.

FMU-113/B Proximity Nose Fuze

The FMU-113/B nose fuze (Figure D-14) is a low-altitude, radar proximity
fuze used in GP bombs. It is 13.75 inches long, 5.6 inches in diameter,
and weighs 8 pounds. An FZU-2/B booster is required to be installed on
the fuze prior to installation in the bomb. The fuze has a safe/arm
indicator that can be viewed after installation in the bomb. The fuze is
mechanically armed and has ground-selectable arming time settings of 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 18 seconds, as well as a SAFE position. Initiation of the
fuze is accomplished by a bungee lanyard pulled at release. This action
allows the nose plug to retract, allowing air to reach the turbine. The fuze
has no stored arming energy; power for sensor operation is obtained from
an internal air-turbine-powered alternator. The sensor portion of the fuze
is designed to provide a 0 to 25-foot (15-foot nominal) HOB. The fuze has
an impact burst backup feature.

FMU-143/B Fuze

This impact tail fuze is used with the BLU-109/B warhead in GBU-10 and
GBU-24A/B laser guided bombs and the AGM-130C missile (Figure D-16).
It has a nonselectable impact delay of 60 milliseconds and two selectable
arming time delays of 5.5 and 12.0 seconds. Arming delay is initiated by
the arming lanyard at bomb release to activate the FZU-32A/B initiator,
which also provides safe escape. A FZU-32B/B uses an air scoop turbine
electrical generator to arm the fuze.

The 60 millisecond delay is activated upon impact allowing for target

penetration before bomb detonation. An impact force of at least 160 G for
6.5 milliseconds is required for detonation.

FMU-139A/B Fuze

This impact fuze is designed to be used with the MK 80 series GP bombs.
Either low drag or high drag functioning is automatically determined by
bomb characteristics. The fuze can be installed in both the nose and tail
fuze wells and is electrically initiated at bomb release by an air scoop
generator (FZU-48/B) in the charging well. For the HD option, the fuze
must be in the tail well. Arming time tolerance is +5% of the faceplate
setting. After arming, an additional .08 seconds must elapse before
impact (for complete safe/arm rotor rotation) or the fuze will not function.
If the fuze senses retardation (high drag option), it uses the preselected
HIGH DRAG ARM/DELAY function (Figure D-17). This is set on the
ground by rotating the appropriate knob on the fuze faceplate. As a safety
feature, a lock-out button must be depressed to select the 2.0 arming time.
Low drag settings are set similarly and are used if no retardation is
sensed after bomb release. Low drag arm time options are 4, 6, 7, 10, 14
and 20 seconds. High drag arm time options are 2, 2.6, 4 and 5 seconds.
Function time delay is selected with the high drag setting, even if
dropping the weapon in the low drag mode. Available options are
instantaneous, .01, .025 and .06 seconds. The fuze contains several safety
devices that should preclude functioning if required parameters are not
met. If at any time a red and black rod is seen protruding from the center
of the fuze faceplate, it should be considered armed.

WEAPON/FUZE COMBINATIONS

The many different munitions the F-15E can carry accommodate a variety
of fuzes that can have numerous settings. Each combination of weapon,
fuze, and setting will produce a predictable effect on a given target. An
example can be shown with the GP bomb. When fitted with an
instantaneous nose fuze, frag and blast are maximized. When a GP bomb
has a delayed tail fuze, cratering is the result. This predictability is used
when choosing weapons to employ against different targets.

Targeting

Targeting, for the purpose of this discussion, is the matching of munitions
with the desired effect on a target. Targeting is normally accomplished at
higher headquarters by the people who have “the big picture.” They use
the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEM), which is now on
computer, as their “Bible” for weapon selection. The JMEM are the
authoritative source of information needed to select weapons and estimate
the force requirements to achieve the desired results.

Munitions Selection

The following are examples of munitions matched to targets to maximize
target destruction.

TEXT
WEAPON CHARACTERISTICS

There are various ways munitions accomplish their purpose. The type of
target you are assigned dictates which weapon and fuze are to be used for
the desired effect. Although this decision is normally made at higher
levels, you should be aware of how munitions accomplish their
purpose-destroying the target.

Bomb Effects

The destructive effect of a bomb, regardless of its size, is due to the
detonation of the high-explosive filler. The chemical reaction (explosion) is
used to achieve one of five basic effects in the target area: blast,
fragmentation, cratering, armor penetration or incendiary.

Blast

The blast effect is caused by the tremendous overpressures generated by
high explosive detonation. Complete detonation of high explosives can
generate pressures up to 700 tons per square inch and temperatures in
the range of 3000 to 4500°C prior to bomb case fragmentation.
Approximately half of the total energy generated is used in swelling the
bomb casing to 1.5 times its normal size prior to fragmenting and then
imparting velocity to those fragments. The remainder of this energy is
expended in compression of the air surrounding the bomb and is
responsible for the blast effect. This effect is most desirable for attacking
industrial complexes or habitable structures with the intention of blowing
down walls, collapsing roofs, destroying or damaging machinery, etc.
Blast is confined to relatively short distances in its effectiveness on
personnel. The maximum distance at which the blast from a 2000 pound
general purpose (GP) bomb is considered effective against personnel is 110
feet. Blast effect of a GP bomb is maximized by using a fuzing system
that produces an air or surface burst with little or no confinement of the
overpressures. The explosive train is directed away from the point of
impact using nose fuzing to ensure maximum blast effect.

D-1 AGW-1


Text from AGW-1_General_Purpose_Bombs_page_8.jpeg:
Fragmentation

The size of bomb fragments depends on the thickness of the case, the case
material, the explosive, and the ratio of explosive weight to case weight.
In weapons where fragment size is not predetermined, such as GP bombs,
the fragments vary widely in size and weight. In weapons where
fragmentation is the desired effect, casings are designed to produce a
uniform fragment size calculated to optimize the effectiveness of the
weapon against particular types of targets. Fragments of a bomb case can
achieve velocities from 3000 to 11,000 fps depending on the type of bomb,
(for example, GP bomb fragments have velocities of 5000 to 9000 fps).
Fragmentation is effective against troops, vehicles, aircraft and other soft
targets. The fragmentation generated from the detonation of a
high-explosive bomb has greater effective range than blast, usually up to
approximately 3000 feet regardless of bomb size. The fragmentation effect
can be maximized by using a bomb specifically designed for this effect, or
by using a GP bomb with an air burst functioning fuze.

Cratering

With conventional aircraft-delivered bombs, the cratering effect is
normally achieved by using a GP bomb with a delayed fuzing system.
This system allows bomb penetration before the explosion occurs and
permits the formation of a larger crater as a result. This effect is most
desirable in interdiction of supply routes and area denial operation. It
also has application in attacks on multiple-storied buildings. Rather than
detonating the bomb instantaneously on impact with the roof of a
building, the delayed fuzing allows the bomb to penetrate and use the
confinement of the building walls to increase the destructive effect. The
kill mechanism is usually blast or fragmentation. The explosive train is
directed towards the point of impact using tail fuzing for cratering and
penetration.

Armor Penetration

Armor penetration is an effective damage mechanism against tanks,
assault guns, armored personnel carriers (APCs), and other armored
targets. Whether accomplished by high kinetic energy penetrators or by
shaped charges, penetration is accompanied by damage within the target
by blast fragmentation or incendiary effects. A major problem associated
with penetration weapons is the lack of damage visible to the follow-on
attacker. This may result in repeated attacks to produce battlefield
evidence that a target is no longer a threat.

AGW-1 D-2


Text from AGW-1_General_Purpose_Bombs_page_9.jpeg:
Incendiary

Fire is effective in interrupting operations of enemy personnel and in
damaging supplies stored in the open. Although a relatively small
firebomb can provide a spectacular display, it often does less damage than
indicated.

Conventional incendiaries, which started great fires during World War II,
had little penetrating capability. Munitions have now been developed
with full fragmentation and penetrating capabilities coupled with reactive
incendiary devices. These improved incendiaries are highly effective
against fuel and other flammable targets.

Bomb Types
Bombs are generally categorized according to the ratio of explosive weight
to total weight. Categories include GP, penetration, demolition and

fragmentation.

General Purpose Bombs

GP bombs can be used against a variety of targets. Since the body case is
approximately 2 inch thick, the casing creates a fragmentation effect at
the moment of detonation. Also, since the explosive filler constitutes
approximately 50% of the total weight, considerable damage from the
blast effect can be gained through the use of proximity fuzes. A general
purpose bomb can be used for cratering by installing a steel nose closure
plug and using a tail fuze. This configuration penetrates medium hard
targets. The bomb was given the designation GP because of its versatility.
These bombs normally weigh between 250 and 2000 pounds and produce
relatively good blast and fragmentation. Examples of this type are the
500 pound MK 82 and 2000 pound MK 84 series bombs.

SUU-64/B / SUU-65/B / SUU-66/B Dispensers

The SUU-64/B, SUU-65/B, and SUU-66/B tactical munitions dispensers
(TMD) (Figure D-3) are three-piece clamshell cluster munitions
dispensers. They are normally used with the FZU-39/B proximity sensor
fuze that offers cockpit selectable function modes. The aircrew has the
option of changing from integral fuze function [TIME] which is nose
arming only, to FZU-39 proximity function [HEIGHT] which arms both
the nose and tail solenoids.

NOTE: On preflight, make sure the fuze arming lanyard is routed
correctly. The nose arming solenoid must also be energized when
selecting the FZU-39 since the integral timer fuze is the source of
electrical power for the FZU-39 proximity sensor. Energizing only the
tail arming solenoid will result in the dispenser impacting the
ground intact since the FZU-39 will otherwise receive no
electrical power to operate.

Text from AGW-2_Dispenser_Munitions_page_11.jpeg:
The SUU-65/B is a SUU-64/B with a modified tail section that imparts
spin to the dispenser to enhance submunitions dispersion. When the
dispenser reaches the preset function altitude, the fuze activates the fin
cant, causing the dispenser to spin. Upon reaching the proper spin rate,
the SUU-65/B opens. The SUU-66/B is a SUU-64/B with the Gator mine
electronics package removed, and the airbag system installed to eject the
submunitions.

SPECIFIC MUNITIONS
The CBUs discussed use the SUU-64/B, SUU-65/B, or SUU-66/B. The

combination of a particular dispenser with a particular submunition
results in a particular CBU designation.

CBU-87 Combined Effects Munitions (CEM)

CBU-87 CEM is a SUU-65/B dispenser loaded with 202 BLU-97/B
bomblets (Figure D-4). The bomblet case is made of scored steel designed
to break into preformed fragments for defeating light armor and
personnel. It also contains a forward-firing, shaped charge liner for
defeating armor, plus a zirconium ring for incendiary capability. This is a
multiuse weapon.

WARNING

CBU-87/B and S/B have experienced
numerous submunition airbursts
immediately following submunition
arming. These airbursts affect safe
separation from submunition shaped
charges during level deliveries when
releasing multiple weapons in the timer
mode. Refer to Section VI of TO 1-1M-34

CBU-89 Gator

CBU-89 consists of a SUU-64/B dispenser containing 72 BLU-91/B
(Figure D-5) and 22 BLU-92/B submunitions. The BLU-91/B antitank
mine is a magnetic target-sensing submunition. Detonation occurs when
the magnetic sensor detects a target, when the mine is disturbed, at the
expiration of the self-destruct time, or when the battery voltage drops
below a specified level. The BLU-92/B antipersonnel mine has a
fragmenting case warhead triggered by one of eight 40 foot trip wires.
Detonation occurs when a target activates the trip wire, when the mine is
disturbed, at the expiration of the self-destruct time, or when the battery
voltage drops to a specified level. The Gator is an excellent area denial
weapon for both armor and personnel.

CBU-97/B SENSOR FUZED WEAPON

The CBU-97 sensor fuzed weapon (SFW) consists of a SUU-66/B TMD, an
airbag dispensing system, 10 BLU-108/B submunitions packaged in two
bays of five, an integral timer fuze, and the FZU-39/B proximity sensor.
SFW is designed to provide multiple kill per pass capability against tanks,
armored vehicles, artillery, APCs, and support vehicles.

The BLU-108/B submunition consists of a nose electronics section,
warhead launcher assembly, rocket motor, and orientation/stabilization
device (OSD). The nose electronics section contains the power supply,
safe-arm device, sequencer, and radar altimeter. The launcher assembly
holds four skeet warheads (four skeet for each BLU-108/B or a total of 40
skeet per SFW munition). The OSD consists of externally mounted fins, a
drogue parachute, and a main parachute.

SFW is delivered as an unguided, gravity drop, direct attack or limited
standoff munition. After release, the SUU-66/B TMD falls and opens as
discussed earlier. When the TMD skin is released, two gas generators fire
inside the TMD inflating forward and aft bay airbags. As gas pressure
fills inside the airbags they expand, overcoming the release locks on the
restraining bands, ejecting first the five submunitions in the forward bay,
followed by the five submunitions in the aft bay.

AGW-2 D-8


Text from AGW-2_Dispenser_Munitions_page_15.jpeg:
The skeets are antiarmor warhead projectiles and function as the kill
mechanism of the SFW. Each contains a thermal battery, a passive
two-color IR sensor, processing electronics, a safe-arm device, and an
explosively formed projectile warhead (Figure D-6).

The skeets are canted slightly during articulation so that upon release
from the spinning submunition, their flight path will contain a slight
wobble (Figure D-7). This is referred to as coning. As the skeets fly away
from the submunition they are spinning and coning. The spinning arms
the skeet via rotation of the safe-arm device while the coning action
causes an IR seeker boresighted to the spin axis of the skeet to describe a
scan pattern across the ground. A single skeet will cover a search area
approximately 100 feet wide and over 300 feet long. The scan patterns of
all forty skeet from a single CBU-97 canister will describe a search
pattern 1200 feet long and 700 feet wide. Skeet operation is depicted in

Figure D - 8. Skeet Operation.

The individual warheads seek targets based on predetermined two-color
IR signatures. When a target is detected, a processor in the skeet issues a
fire pulse to the detonator within 60 ms (+10 ms). The explosive output of
the detonator initiates the precision initiation coupler. This initiates the
high explosive which in turn produces a high velocity, aeroballistically
stable charge, called an explosively forged penetrator. This explosively
formed projectile hits and penetrates the engine area from the top of the
target inflicting a mobility kill. If the skeet does not detect a target
during the fly-out period, a self-destruct feature detonates the warhead
8.0 seconds after release.

FUZES

FZU-39/B Proximity Sensor

This proximity sensor (Figure D-9) is used with the SUU-64/B, SUU-65/B,
and SUU-66/B dispensers. It has selectable arming time and height of
function settings. It transmits a signal which it uses to determine vertical
height. When a SUU-64/B or SUU-66/B reaches the preset height, the
sensor sends a fire pulse to the integral fuze, opening the canister. On the
SUU-65/B, at preset height, the sensor sends a signal for fin cant causing
the dispenser to spin. Then when reaching the preset spin rate, the
canister opens. There is also a selectable ECM feature. The FZU-39
options are shown on Figure D-10. The PACS program should mirror the
correct fuze settings. Time or height of function is cockpit selectable.

If the FZU-39/B fuze was not available, the dispensers have an integral
timer fuze. However, expect that the FZU-39/B fuze will be available and
tasked to be used in the height of function mode. The radar proximity
fuze provides more consistent minefield dimensions or frag patterns and
more liberal release parameters than the integral timer fuze.

FZU-39/B ECM Mode

The FZU-39 ECM mode is selected by an on/off switch on the side of the
fuze. When the ECM switch is positioned to the ON position and the fuze
is unable to determine height above ground due to the presence of
jamming, the ECM mode is activated. If the ECM mode is able to defeat
the jamming, the fuze will function normally. If the ECM mode fails to
counter the jamming, the fuze will open the dispenser after a two-second
delay. This normally results in the fuze functioning to open the dispenser
at other than the desired height above ground. However, this ECM
feature at least provides for dispenser opening even when radar range is
denied.

If the ECM mode is selected and no ECM is experienced, the fuze will
function normally. Not selecting the ECM mode in a jamming
environment may result in the dispenser impacting the ground intact.
Further detail of how the ECM mode functions is not necessary for the
level of knowledge required to plan for and employ Gator mines and CEM
munitions. The important point is that the ECM mode should always be

selected.

WEAPON/FUZE COMBINATIONS

The many different munitions the F-15E can carry accommodate a variety
of fuzes that can have numerous settings. Each combination of weapon,
fuze, and setting will produce a predictable effect on a given target. An
example can be shown with the CBU-87. Delivery is most flexible with
the FZU-39 with HEIGHT function selected by the crew. If TIME is
selected, delivery parameters become increasingly important, since fuze
function is controlled only by the integral timer as opposed to the
proximity fuze. With TIME selected the dispenser will fall for the preset
number of seconds and then open regardless of altitude. If you are too
high you do not get the desired submunition density. If you are too low
the dispenser may hit the ground before opening.

Targeting

Targeting, for the purpose of this discussion, is the matching of munitions
with the desired effect on a target. Targeting is normally accomplished at
higher headquarters by the people who have “the big picture.” They use
the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEM) as their “Bible” for
weapon selection. The JMEMs are the authoritative source of information
needed to select weapons and estimate the force requirements to achieve
the desired results.

Munitions Selection

The following are examples of munitions matched to targets to maximize
target destruction.

CBU with Instantaneous Fuze

Since CBU munitions are quite small and depend on small high speed
fragments to be lethal, the target must be unprotected (even trees can
diminish the killing power). CBUs are good against:

° personnel

¢ light trucks

¢ unprotected fuel/ammunition
° radar vans/antennas/SAMs

° aircraft on the ground

especially good for denying armor or personnel movement through an
area.

WEAPON CHARACTERISTICS

The dispenser munition is one of several types of ordnance carried by the
F-15E. The dispenser munition consists of a larger case, called the
dispenser, which contains smaller submunitions. This lesson covers the
various types of dispensers and submunitions, and how they function.

Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs)

CBUs are dispensers loaded with various submunitions. Each CBU has a
designated design purpose. Also, the numbering of the various CBUs can
be confusing. CBU designation is derived from a combination of a
dispenser type and different submunitions.

D-1 AGW-2


Text from AGW-2_Dispenser_Munitions_page_8.jpeg:
Dispensers

During employment, a dispenser may remain attached to the aircraft (as
the submunitions are released) or be released as a free-fall unit. This
discussion is limited to the free-fall type, as that is the most common.
Free-fall dispensers are carried and released much like general purpose
bombs. They are designed as clamshells with three longitudinal sections
(Figure D-1). The clamshells blow apart at a predetermined time after
release or at a preset altitude. At this time, the submunitions are
released into the airstream. The altitude above the ground at which the
fuze functions (and separates the clamshells) is known as the height of
function (HOF). The HOF, dive angle, and airspeed determine the size of
the pattern of the bomblets on the ground. A larger pattern decreases the
density of the bomblets. Refer to the Dash 34 to determine the delivery
parameters and fuze settings for the desired area coverage.

Submunitions

There are various submunitions or bomblets (Figure D-2) that can be used
in the dispensers. The F-15E only carries and delivers CBU-87, CBU-89,
and CBU-97. Most of the submunitions are designed for light material
and personnel in the open. Others with a shaped charge are good against
armor. The primary kill mechanism for CBU munitions is fragmentation,
but other important elements are armor penetration and incendiary
effects.

Paveway I and II use the following fuzes: M905, FMU-26B/B, FMU-81/B,
FMU-139A/B or the FMU-152/B. Only the FMU-152/B can be used for
GBU-10 with the MXU-651/B airfoil group (GBU-10 G/B, H/B, J/B)
Paveway II.

Flight Path Characteristics

The flight path of the LGB is adjusted by the guidance and control section
to meet the required impact criteria. However, the design of the system
may result in some effects that can significantly degrade the performance
of the weapon. The following explanation of the typical LGB flight path
discusses these effects on performance.

The LGB flight path can be divided into three phases: ballistic, transition
and terminal guidance. The ballistic (unguided) phase, consists of the
period of flight which lasts at least as long as the gas grain generator
delay. The ballistic phase may last the entire time of flight (TOF),
depending on the field of view (FOV) and/or detector sensitivity
constraints that restrict target acquisition and guided response.

Ballistic Phase

During the ballistic phase, the weapon continues on the unguided
trajectory established by the flight path of the delivery aircraft at the
moment of release. In the ballistic phase, the delivery attitude takes on
additional importance. If released in a loft, the weapon continues its
climb, increasing in altitude but losing velocity. For level release, the
weapon begins to lose velocity almost immediately and continues to
decelerate until it has established a steep dive angle. Altitude permitting,
it now ceases to lose velocity and slowly accelerates. If released in a high
angle dive mode, the weapon normally accelerates from the moment of
release to impact or until it reaches terminal velocity.

The change in weapon velocity during the ballistic flight can be critical.
This is especially true if the velocity loss before acquisition is substantial.
The maneuverability of the LGB is related to the weapon velocity during
terminal guidance. Therefore, airspeed lost during the ballistic phase
(and not recovered before acquisition) equates to a proportional loss of
maneuverability during terminal guidance.

D-5 AGW-3


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_12.jpeg:
Transition Phase

The transition phase begins at acquisition. The following conditions must
be satisfied to accomplish acquisition:

1. The target must be within the detector FOV.

2. The reflected laser energy from the target must be of sufficient
intensity to activate and maintain guidance circuits.

3. The gas grain generator delay must have expired and there must be
sufficient gas pressure buildup to activate the canards.

At acquisition, there is usually a large error between the weapon velocity
vector and the line of sight (LOS) to the target (Figure D-3). In the
transition phase, the weapon attempts to reduce this error by aligning the
velocity vector with the LOS vector to the target. This phase usually
takes from 0 to 3 seconds. During this period, the commands to the
control surfaces are generally sustained for longer periods, causing
additional energy loss.

Additionally as shown in Figure D-8, the first guidance command is
usually down for a weapon delivered near the ballistic trajectory to the
target. This causes the impact angle to be lower if the weapon guides to
the target than if it remains ballistic. Also if the weapon stops guiding
(failure of weapon or designator) it will normally resume a ballistic
trajectory to an impact short of the target.

Terminal Guidance Phase

The terminal guidance phase begins when the apparent guidance error is
reduced and the weapon develops an oscillating pattern around the LOS.
An oscillatory flight path is produced because (1) the detector senses only
the direction (not magnitude) of error, and (2) the canard deflections are
always full scale.

During terminal guidance, the LGB attempts to keep its velocity vector
aligned with the instantaneous LOS (Figure D-3). At the instant
alignment occurs, the reflected laser energy centers on the detector and
commands the canards to a trail position. At this time the weapon flies
ballistically with gravity biasing the velocity vector short of the target.
Therefore, the reflected energy is moved from the detector center, which
generates an up command. In effect, the weapon’s velocity vector tends to
oscillate about a point short of the target, which may cause the LGB flight
path to sag. The extent of this sag is dependent on the delivery angle and
airspeed.

Optimum Guidance Time

Release tables for LGBs are generated with consideration for the gas grain
generator safe separation delay, and provide for 5 seconds of guidance.
However, field experience has shown that an optimum guidance time of

8 seconds provides a much greater probability of success for low altitude
deliveries. The minimum TOF to ensure optimum guidance time for low
altitude deliveries are:

Paveway I (all) .......ccccccccccccccccceceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees 11 seconds
Paveway TD eecceccecceccccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees 10 seconds
Codin

Laser coding has two purposes: (1) to meet the requirement for
bomb/target discrimination in a multilaser environment and (2) to provide
effective operation in the presence of enemy countermeasures. Asa
result, two code formats have been developed for use: pulse repetition
frequency (PRF) and pulse interval modulation (PIM). Refer to

TO 1-1M-34-1 (Confidential) for a detailed discussion of laser coding.

Delivery Considerations

LGBs are terminally guided munitions, not wonder bombs that can be
hurled into the general vicinity of the target and be expected to find, guide
to and impact the target.

Predicted LGB performance is based on the weapon release at a
preplanned airspeed, dive angle, altitude and horizontal ground range
from the target. The different LGB flight characteristics can dramatically
affect predicted performance. To improve LGB performance, those
characteristics can be controlled to some extent during the three phases of
LGB flight.

AGW-3 D-8


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_15.jpeg:
Energy

Energy, a function of airspeed and altitude, is the prime consideration
when selecting the delivery parameters. Energy provides the
maneuverability necessary for the LGB to reach the target. Flight path
angle and airspeed are the primary parameters the aircrew can vary to
meet energy requirements. In general, a steeper flight path angle and
higher airspeed improve LGB performance.

Flight Path Angle

A flight path angle of approximately -30° is the general dividing line
between associated velocity effects. When the flight path angle is
shallower than -30°, the weapon continues to decelerate after acquisition
and until impact. This deceleration reduces the airspeed and thus the
maneuverability of the weapon. With the loss of maneuverability, the
control commands must be held longer to return the weapon to the line of
sight (LOS). The longer the command is held the more the airspeed is
depleted during the maneuver. When flight path angles become
shallower, the probability increases for a weapon to impact short of the
target. Weapons with a flight path angle steeper beyond -30° tend to
accelerate after acquisition. The steeper the angle above -30°, the greater
the acceleration. This results in increased maneuverability during the
final portion of flight, especially for dive angles of -45° or steeper (Figure
D-4).

Atmospheric Density Altitude Effects

The LGB flies like a glider, relying on energy for maneuverability. Like a
glider, the performance of the weapon is directly proportional to the total
energy possessed at release: potential and kinetic. The kinetic energy
level of the weapon is dynamic and is continually in a state of change: loss,
gain or conversion.

The G-producing capability of the LGB is directly related to the weapon’s
calibrated airspeed. Ballistic range depends on true airspeed. In
situations where the target may be located at a high density altitude, the
difference between true and calibrated airspeed becomes an important
planning factor. Under these conditions the LGB performance may be
degraded and it may be unable to generate sufficient maneuverability to
reach the target. In these cases, increasing true airspeed as much as
practical will compensate for the loss in maneuverability.

AGW-3 D-10


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_17.jpeg:
Podium Effect

The podium effect (Figure D-5) must be countered when lasing a vertical
target. As the airborne designator flies around the target, it may become
impossible to illuminate the front of the target. Although the laser may
still be on the side of the target, the bomb may not have a clear LOS to the
laser spot. Once the LGB loses the spot from its FOV, it continues its
flight ballistically. This usually results in weapon impact short of the
target. Podium effect may be overcome by your wingman lasing for you
from behind or attacking from an angle to keep your pod LOS on the
target face; however, impact angle less than 90° may affect penetration.

Spot Motion

Figure D - 5. Podium Effect.

Every designator has inherent stabilization characteristics that cause spot
motion while lasing a target. Even with automatic tracking or “perfect”
manual tracking, airborne designators have some spot motion due to
aircraft vibration. The amount of spot motion is variable and cannot be
minimized consistently for a long period of time. Spot motion tends to
increase the circular error probable (CEP) of the weapon due to increased
energy loss during the last few seconds of flight. Elevated spot, delayed
lasing and carefully chosen release parameters increase terminal energy

and help counter the adverse effects of spot motion for low altitude
deliveries. A good PTRK is also better than ATRK in reducing jitter.

There is also a laser-to-FLIR boresight tolerance of .25 mils and a laser
beam divergence of .25 mils. To ensure these factors do not pull the spot
off the target, be sure the target size (1 mil) is twice the diameter of the
crosshair gap in NFOV (.498 mils) during LGB guidance (Figure D-6).

AGW-03-06

Figure D - 6. Spot Motion.
Spot Height

Elevating the laser spot on a vertically developed target improves LGB
performance at low altitude when the shallow flight path angle is most
apparent.

Consider the situation when an LGB is committed against a small point
target from a low-altitude delivery. If all the preplanned release
parameters are met and the weapon acquires the target at the expected
slant range, the flight path angle during the guidance phase is usually
-30°, but angles of -10° to -15° are not uncommon. At these shallow flight
path angles, the influence of gravity is more pronounced than at angles
steeper than -45°. During oscillatory flight, the weapon is located below
instantaneous LOS for a larger portion of the time. As the flight
continues, and the weapon corrects up to the LOS, drag resulting from
control fin deflection increases and the airspeed decays. As the airspeed
decreases, the time required to make the correction back to the LOS
increases, as does the airspeed bleed off, and these effects continue until
weapon impact.

Delayed Lasing

During LGB development, the main delivery method for ballistic weapons
was high angle, high speed from medium-to-high altitude. These release
conditions conserved the weapon velocity and in many cases, under the
influence of gravity, the weapon accelerated and impacted at a velocity
higher than release. Under these employment conditions, target
acquisition as early as possible was beneficial and late acquisition could
prove disastrous. Taking these release parameters into consideration, the
guidance unit was designed to meet specific miss criteria under these
release conditions.

As threat capabilities improved, the proposed methods for employing the
LGB progressed from high speed, high angle to low altitude, low angle.

The change to the low-altitude employment environment increased the
importance of some LGB flight parameters. For instance, with a
high-angle, high-speed delivery, early lasing and acquisition was possibly
an advantage, but certainly not a disadvantage. In the low-altitude,
low-angle environment this was not true; too early an acquisition was a
hindrance.

With regard to guidance time, there are three possibilities: insufficient,
optimum and excessive. As implied, insufficient guidance time does not
allow the weapon adequate time to acquire the target, remove positional
errors and stabilize itself about the LOS before impact. Analysis of results
from flights with less than 6 seconds of guidance time has indicated they
are usually marginally satisfactory.

AGW-3 D-14


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_21.jpeg:
During low-angle deliveries, with terminal flight path angles shallower
than -30°, extended or excessive guidance time produces a detrimental
effect on LGB performance. This is usually the result of excessive
airspeed loss. The weapon acquires, maneuvers to establish itself on the
instantaneous LOS, and (when on the LOS) commands control fins to go
in-trail. The weapon falls ballistically until an error is sensed by the
computer. At that time another control fin movement is commanded and
held until the weapon has returned to the LOS; the control fins then move
to the in-trail position. The process is repeated over and over until
weapon impact. During these periods when the control fins are at
maximum deflection, the increased drag results in an airspeed decay. As
the process is repeated, the LGB airspeed continues to decrease; and if the
guidance time is excessive, weapon maneuverability before impact may
have degenerated to the point of being insufficient to remove final
remaining errors. Performance degradation has been observed in
weapons with shallow impact angles and guidance time greater than

12 seconds.

From the boundaries presented for insufficient and excessive guidance
times (6 seconds and 12 seconds, respectively), it would appear that the
best result for low-altitude employment of LGBs can be achieved by
attempting to provide 8 to 10 seconds of guidance time to the weapon
under these conditions.

Loft deliveries, especially those released at less than +25°, fit into the
category of low-angle deliveries previously discussed. Loft deliveries
present their own set of unique characteristics that influence the manner
in which the LGB responds during guided flight.

The weapon velocity, representing the maneuvering capability available
for guided flight, may go through radical changes during the loft flight
profile. The airspeed deviation from release to apogee can vary as little as
a 12 knot loss for a +5° loft with 450 KTAS run-in to a loss of 253 knots for
a +40° loft with a 700 KTAS run-in. The loss of airspeed equates to
reduced maneuvering capability of the weapon during the terminal phase
of flight before impact.

D-15 AGW-3


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_22.jpeg:
Figure D-8 shows a typical LGB loft guidance profile. From release at
point A, the weapon follows a ballistic trajectory, losing airspeed in the
climb. At point B the guidance electronics are activated to look for laser
energy within the seeker FOV. At point C the laser spot comes within the
FOV and the weapon begins terminal guidance. Note that the first
guidance command is down and the weapon attempts to stay on the LOS;
it is below the ballistic flight path to the target. This means that any loss
of guidance will result in the weapon resuming a new ballistic flight path
that will impact short of the target.

Figure D - 8. LGB Loft Guidance Profile.

Some adverse effects can be mitigated by using the technique of delaying
target illumination (delayed lasing) that has the effect of conserving
weapon energy by delaying target acquisition and reducing weapon
guidance time.

Lofts of +1° to +10°, because of their short times of flight (normally less
than 12 seconds), do not lend themselves readily to the delayed lasing
technique. The maximum benefit from delayed lasing can be derived from
lofts with release angles greater than +10° and up to approximately +25°.
The primary reason is that LGBs lofted within this band may acquire the
target and initiate guidance before reaching apogee and therefore,
generate the problems associated with early acquisition and excessive
guidance times. Lofts at angles greater than +25° do not usually acquire
the target until past apogee, but these deliveries are compatible with the
technique of delayed lasing and benefits associated with its use. When
employing delayed lasing, plan to designate the target during the last 8 to
10 seconds of the weapon TOF.

AGW-3 D-16


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_23.jpeg:
Figure D-9 shows the effects of delayed lasing on a 20°, 550 KTAS loft
delivery. If the weapon initiates guidance at position 1 as the laser spot
comes into the weapon FOV, it will not have the energy available to reach
the target and will impact short. If lasing is delayed until position 2, a
steeper impact angle will result. This is a risky technique however,
because if guidance is delayed too long, the weapon may not have time to
correct the trajectory to the target.

Optimal Release Point

LGB capabilities are expressed in terms of release envelopes. The release
envelope for a particular LGB is defined as that region in space where the
weapon can be released and achieve a 30 foot CEP. This means that for
given parameters within the envelope, a single LGB has a 50% probability
of guiding to within 30 feet of the target.

Figure D-10 shows a typical dive release envelope. These envelopes are
produced by a computer model using many ballistic and aerodynamic
inputs. FOV boundary limits show the capability of the weapon to acquire
the laser spot. Within the FOV limit is that envelope where release will
ensure a 30 foot CEP. In general, the front of the envelope is a FOV limit
and the rear is a weapon energy limit. Within the 30 foot CEP boundary
are two points of interest: the ballistic release point (BRP) and the optimal
release point (ORP).

Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_25.jpeg:
The BRP is the no-wind point where, if the weapon is released, the bomb
will ballistically hit the target. The ORP is the release point that provides
the highest probability of success for given parameters.

Valid arguments exist for using both these release points for weapon
delivery. The BRP gives good probability of target damage if the
designator or weapon guidance system fails. The drawback to using the
BRP is that it always lies near the forward edge of the envelope for higher
angle deliveries where release errors may put the weapon FOV beyond the
target. This would cause a no-guide and a bomb that hits long of the
target. For lower angle deliveries, the BRP lies further back in the
envelope where release errors may put the weapons too short to achieve a
30 foot CEP.

The ORP location takes into account both delivery errors and LGB
performance characteristics. Every dive release envelope is characterized
by dive angle, airspeed and delivery dispersion. A cross-sectioned cut in
the upper left corner (Figure D-10) illustrates how the LGB 30 foot CEP
boundary and aircraft delivery dispersion overlay are used to determine
the ORP. A release at the BRP or 30 foot CEP rear boundary would often
yield a release outside the 30 foot CEP due to delivery errors. Delivery at
the ORP yields a release inside the 30 foot CEP.

dispersion. An LGB release between the front and rear FOV boundaries
will acquire the target, but only the LGB release within the LGB envelope

LGBs released outside the envelope, but within the FOV, will acquire the

LGBs released outside the FOV boundaries will not acquire the target and
will fall ballistically. LGBs released on the ORP will acquire and guide to
the target with the highest probability of success.

AGW-3 D - 20


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_27.jpeg:
The F-15E central computer is programmed to deliver LGBs at the BRP.
Track correction is required to adjust for release at the ORP. Figure D-10
shows that for long range (high angle) lofts, the ORP is before the BRP.
This requires a negative track correction for release at the ORP, which
would cause the bomb to ballistically fall short if guidance fails. For short
range (low angle) lofts the ORP is long of the BRP. This would require a
positive track correction, which would cause the bomb to ballistically fall
long of the target. Note that at low angles, the ballistic line falls outside
the 30 foot CEP envelope. This means that with no track correction, a low
angle loft delivery may not achieve a 30 foot CEP even if it guides. Also
note there is one point at which the BRP and the ORP are the same. Loft
deliveries at this release point will ballistically hit the target if they do not
guide. They will also have the highest probability of hit if they do guide.

There are many employment techniques involving the use of the ORP.
ORP was first developed before delayed lasing techniques and is now not
considered to be as critical to success. A lot will depend on the advice and
experience of your squadron weapons officer and others that have
employed GBUs using both ORP and BRP.

Summary Considerations

e Delivery parameters must be selected that yield a minimum TOF of
10 to 11 seconds

e Delay lasing until the last 8 to 10 seconds of TOF for low angle
deliveries. Continuous lasing is recommended for GBU-10s released

above 20,000 feet

e Steeper flight path angle and higher airspeed improve LGB
performance

e Ensure laser energy stays on the same side of a vertical target from
which the weapon was delivered

e Keep spot motion to a minimum
e Elevate the laser spot on vertical targets for low angle deliveries

e Consider ORP techniques

Next choose a delivery profile based on the threat, the above factors and
the weather, to include:

e Laser range depends on humidity, dust, etc.
e With low ceilings take care not to loft the bomb into clouds

e Rain showers may also affect the bomb before delivery. Paveway IIs
have a rain impact endurance of ten minutes before the seeker
degrades.

e Wind effects are discussed in the employment considerations section.
Employment Considerations

Elevating the laser spot has already been addressed. Laser guided
ordnance is also affected by wind from release to impact. During the
unguided portion of its trajectory, the LGB travels with the air mass
exactly the same as an unguided bomb. Once guidance is initiated, the
wind affects the weapon in much the same manner as gravity. A
crosswind will cause the weapon to fly a homing flight path to the target.
A headwind increases LGB tendency to hit short, or downwind. The loss
of energy and homing effect are results of the increased number of up
commands necessary to maintain the LOS.

The spot designation should correct for winds during the guidance phase.
The winds from the surface to 4000 feet are more significant than those
above 4000 feet. So wind correction should be based on the average winds
of these altitudes. The illuminator may compensate for wind by offsetting
the spot on the target into the wind 1 foot per knot (not to exceed 20 feet
and never move the spot off the target). Tail wind corrections are not
necessary as it reduces the range and flight time of the weapon except
when tail wind exceeds 20 knots and the FOV becomes a problem. Tail
wind counteracts the LGB tendency to hit short by getting the bombs to
the target with less energy expenditure. However, spot positioning for
wind should take second place to other considerations, such as elevated
spot. The tendency is to overcorrect for wind, and 20 feet is a pretty small
distance (consider target size).

Target considerations include target study, axis of attack and target
reflectivity. Satellite photographs from the AFMSS or other sources
provide excellent target study information. As always, working big to
small is most effective. The axis of attack may be dictated by ground
based laser teams, the threat, friendly troop positions or the wish to take
advantage of environmental elements. Optimizing sun shadow for the
target pod, maximizing vertical development and minimizing wind effects
all may lead to a specific attack axis or designation turn off left or right.
In most cases, especially low altitude, a designation leg with the targeting
pod looking left is desired rather than looking right through the aircraft
(i.e. aircraft checks right after release).

Employment Profile

You may be given the opportunity to drop inert or live LGBs while at
FTU. A typical high altitude, low threat profile is shown in Figure D-13.
The pilot flies the profile and maintains visual on lead or deconflicts with
the A/A radar after 12 nm. The WSO performs a PVU prior to 20 nm.
After checking 30°, mapping, updating and designating (.67 DW) are
accomplished. No later than 12 nm, the pilot must proceed direct to the
target (center ASL). The WSO then acquires the target with the targeting
pod, tracks the target (ATRK recommended), and fires the laser for a
designation. Valid laser ranging occurs when LAS XXXXX is at the top
left corner of the targeting pod.

The example given is for a 25° dive. Another delivery option is a level
delivery.

After bomb release, a 60-90° check off target will maintain the
designation. Masking occurs according to the target pod limits. Flashing
cursors indicate approaching a mask condition. Lifting the target side
wing and a slight bunt (low altitude) should delay the masking long
enough for bomb impact. Time to impact (TIMPCT.XX) is displayed at the
top center of the target pod display under PB #18 as well as on the HUD.
A rule of thumb is if TIMPCT is at 15 seconds or less when the target
reaches 3/9 (usually about 50-60° of turn) on the pod, masking will not
occur.

PAVEWAY III
Low-level, Laser Guided Bomb (GBU-24)

The GBU-24 low-level, laser guided bomb (LLLGB) comprises a

2000 pound bomb body, suitable fuzing and guidance kit. The guidance
kit consists of two main sections: a guidance control unit (GCU) and an
AFG. The GCU consists of a laser energy detector (seeker assembly), a
guidance electronics unit (GEU) and a bomb control section. PW III uses
helium gas for canard movement. The AFG consists of a folding-wing
assembly, four canard-type guidance fins, a forward adapter assembly and
other ancillary items for mounting hardware.

Two versions of the GBU-24 are available. The GBU-24/B (Figure D-14)
uses a standard MK-84 bomb body, while the GBU-24A/B uses a BLU-109
bomb body to increase effectiveness against hardened targets. Fuzing
options include any of those that are compatible with the MK-84 or
BLU-109 warheads.

Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_38.jpeg:
The BSU-84/B AFG provides properly sized wings and control fins for the
MK-84 warhead. Additional adapters are used with the BLU-109
warhead. The folding-fin wing assembly is mounted on the tail of the
warhead. The fins are deployed by internal springs immediately after
bomb release. Fins are off center to roll the bomb.

Performance envelopes for all modes of delivery are considerably larger
than those for earlier LGBs due to increased maneuverability (larger
wings), proportional guidance (not bang-bang) and increased seeker
sensitivity and field of regard.

Fuzing

The GBU-24/B can use the FMU-81/B, FMU-139A/B or the FMU-152/B
fuzes. The GBU-24A/B can use the FMU-1438 series or FMU-152/B fuzes.

Initialization

At pickle, the bomb is unlocked from its rack and the ejector feet push it
away. The fuze arming wires are withdrawn, activating one or both fuzes,
as determined by cockpit arming selection. The thermal battery lanyard
is tied off to the rear bomb lug and a swivel connects the lanyard to the
nose arming solenoid. This allows the weapon to be jettisoned without
activating the autopilot, which could fly the weapon excessive distances
before impact.

The tail latch is activated by approximately 50 pounds of tension from a
lanyard that is tied off to the positive arming attachment. This lanyard
has a weak link that breaks when about 220 pounds of tension is applied,
allowing the lanyard to fall away with the weapon.

Major initialization events are as follows:

1.

The two lanyards are pulled approximately 0.1 second after pickle.
The rear lanyard activates the wing deployment sequence only.

The next event in the time sequence is a ballistic mode test at 1.2
seconds. If altitude, as indicated by the barometer, is greater than
15,000 feet, the ballistic mode is entered after bump-up.

In the example, the safe escape timeout is shown at 2.0 seconds. The
software timer starts at microprocessor-up and runs for 1.3 seconds
to ensure at least 1.5 seconds from lanyard pull, to canard activation.
Before this time, the canards are in free trail. When the control fins
are activated, a positive (up) vertical command is issued. This starts
the initial velocity estimate sequence and provides an early pull-up
or bump-up that may be critical if the release altitude is low.

The initial bump-up command excites the airframe and causes a
short series of pitch oscillations. The frequency of these oscillations
is air-speed dependent, and measurement of the frequency of the
oscillations provides a measure of airspeed. The airspeed estimate is
used for nearly all decisions and calculations made by the
microprocessor. This initial velocity estimate is updated
continuously throughout weapon flight.

The seeker is uncaged at 2.2 seconds and the gimbal torquers are
energized at 2.3 seconds. If, at this time, the target return is within
the seeker's instantaneous field of view (IFOV), such as when
working close to the target, the seeker will slew to center the target.
This feature allows direct transition to terminal guidance at

4 seconds.

AGW-3 D - 34


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_41.jpeg:
6. After 4 seconds have elapsed, the delivery mode decision can be
made. The length of time required for this decision is complicated by
several factors, and the time line reflects worst-case conditions.
Therefore, the delivery mode decision to follow a loft, level or dive
midcourse can occur between 4 and 13 seconds. Pressure altitude
changes, between successive altitude measurements, are used to
determine if the weapon is climbing, diving or nearly level. If the
initial velocity estimate is above 900 fps, a delay of up to 10 seconds
allows the weapon to slow down. If the airspeed drops below 900 fps
prior to 10 seconds, the altitude measurements begin and an earlier
decision is made. The altitude and velocity differentials are
triangulated to determine the climb or dive angle. This angle
computation determines the midcourse mode to be entered.

The decision zones for midcourse selection are:
@ Level or altitude-hold mode: -10° to +15° FPA
@ Loft mode: above +15° FPA
@ Dive or constant glide slope mode: below -10° FPA

Because of measurement inaccuracies, an improper mode decision may
occur when the weapon is released near the -10° or +15° decision
boundaries. This zone of improper mode selection is several degrees wide,
and its variance about the decision boundary changes with Mach. This
improper mode selection has minimal consequences.

In the loft case, an improper decision places the weapon in the
altitude-hold mode. Because the range capability in altitude-hold is
generally greater than the loft capability, the weapon reaches the target
unless the desire was to loft over a range of hills. Therefore, when lofting
to clear intervening terrain, a minimum loft angle of 20° should be used.

Figure D - 17. Delivery Above 15,000 Feet.

At a maximum time of 1.2 seconds after release, the computer reads the
altimeter. If the altitude is above 15,000 feet mean sea level (MSL), the
canards are driven to the 0° deflection position after safe separation and
bump-up. The weapon then falls ballistically until acquisition. After
acquisition, terminal guidance is initiated and a g-biased proportional
guidance trajectory is established. This trajectory shaping generally adds
5° to 10° of impact angle to the weapon acquisition angle. Impact angles
from 25° to 65° can be achieved. Planning considerations for this type of
delivery are virtually the same as those for the Paveway I and Paveway II
systems. Other considerations are:

1. Dive bomb deliveries above 15,000 feet may require a depressed

pipper because the weapon falls ballistically and not in the constant
glide-path mode available below 15,000 feet.

D - 37 AGW-3


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_44.jpeg:
2. Because the weapon has excess energy from releases above
15,000 feet, true centroid releases from the center of the envelope are
possible. This type of release does not degrade weapon accuracy as it
did in earlier LGBs because the seeker sensitivity is greater.

This equates to, “when in doubt, release early, not late.” In dive
deliveries, do not press the front edge of the envelope expecting greater
accuracy as in the Paveway I and Paveway II.

Deliveries below 15,000 feet have an adaptive midcourse based on delivery
attitude.

Level Delivery Below 15,000 Feet

Level delivery of the LLLGB is possible down to normal level safe escape
altitude of about 500 feet AGL. After release, the weapon climbs
approximately 450 feet (bump-up) and then levels off (Figure D-18). After
level-off, the weapon holds a straight-and-level midcourse until target
acquisition occurs. After the acquisition, the terminal mode is entered
where trajectory shaping (G-bias) occurs to achieve a good impact angle.
In addition, proportional navigation guidance is initiated to cancel wind
and target motion effects.

The level or altitude hold mode is entered after the bump-up maneuver is
completed and flight path angle lies between -10° and +15°. To ensure not
exceeding the level profile limits, the F-15E will not release a bomb in
AUTO mode outside of +10° to -5° with a loft angle of 0° set in the A/G
delivery program page.

AGW-3 D - 38


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_45.jpeg:
During altitude hold, the seeker +30° azimuth bar scan pattern is
approximately 10° below the inertially sensed horizon. The
straight-and-level midcourse is flown until target acquisition, at which
time a transition is made to the terminal mode.

The terminal mode causes the weapon to climb slightly and then nose over
toward the target. The impact angle from level flight is generally 25° and
is always at least 10° if the weapon is released within the envelope.

Level Safe Escape

A miniloft delivery (2° to 12° of pitch) is required for releases below the
weapon safe escape altitude. This slight pitch up ensures safe escape
since the weapon is bumping to a level flight profile and also may fall
away ballistically and hit the ground prior to its bump. For safe escape, a
4 G turn must be used after release for 500 feet level and miniloft
deliveries. This type of weapon delivery is sensed as a level delivery if
release is below the +15° boundary and the weapon will enter the
altitude-hold mode. Figure D-19 shows the required pitch angle for safe
escape when releasing below the level safe escape altitude (with a 4G
break). The example indicates the pitch angle required for safe escape
from a 100 foot AGL release at 500 KTAS. The MK-84 requires a 5°
minimum pitch angle.

Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_46.jpeg:
Employment of the LLLGB in the level or altitude-hold mode requires
adequate planning to use the full potential of the weapon. Major
considerations include weapon TOF, acquisition range and LOS
restrictions.

Dive Bomb Delivery Below 15,000 Feet

Dive bomb delivery was designed for the Mode 1 low profile, but can be
used in any mode. Dive bomb delivery of the LLLGB is more simplified
than the delivery of other conventional weapons when the LLLGB is
released below 15,000 feet. It is called a point and shoot delivery and is
delivered in DIRECT instead of AUTO. Remember in AUTO the bomb
will not release with lower than a -5° FPA. It is only necessary for the
crew to point the aircraft at the target and release the weapon (pickle).
The velocity vector within 25 mils of the target is the preferred pointing
method, but a pipper mil setting or the ZSL gun cross may also be used.
After release, the weapon bumps up and then acquires the aircraft dive
angle at release and flies a constant glide-path to the target (Figure D-20).

At acquisition, the terminal mode will bias the subsequent flight path
above the initial flight path to a degree dependent upon the mode
selection on the weapon and the time spent in the terminal mode. For
most deliveries, the resulting impact angle is 5° to 10° steeper than the

AGW-3 D - 40


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_47.jpeg:
release angle and impact angles range from 25° to 65° for Mode 1 and 2 or
steeper for Modes 3 and 4. Because a dive profile will impact in the
vicinity of the target even if it does not guide, this delivery was used
extensively in Kosovo. A Mode 4 high diving profile has also been used in
Northern Watch and achieved in excess of 70° impact angles.

The base leg placement is not critical in most deliveries because dive angle
is not a factor when the airspeed is above 400 KTAS and the ground range
is less than 17,000 feet. These minimum parameters allow a dive angle
between 10° to 60° with no concern about the weapon having sufficient
energy to reach the target. As the release airspeed is increased, the
maximum ground range possible extends to well over 40,000 feet at 700
KTAS.

Loft Delivery (All Altitudes)

Loft deliveries with the LLLGB are compatible with standard loft delivery
techniques. When the weapon is lofted above 15°, the weapon's computer
senses the delivery method and zeroes the canards after the bump-up
maneuver. The weapon then flies a ballistic trajectory until acquisition
(Figure D-21). After acquisition, the weapon trajectory-shaping algorithm
produces a flight path that is flown above the acquisition LOS. This
prevents the trajectory sag and short-of-the-target impacts associated
with Paveway I and II. Impact angles of 55° to 65° are achieved.

Mode 2 Delivery

Delivery options in Mode 2 are identical to Mode 1 except performance is
improved against hard targets by limiting canard travel to 5° just prior to
impact. This reduces the weapon's angle of attack (AOA), improving
penetration characteristics. Mode selection is based on 10,000 feet versus
15,000 feet. The BLU-109 bomb body also increases penetration of hard
targets. Mode 2 is preferred over Mode 1 due to greater penetration and
greatly improved software coding. There is also a fast track profile in
Modes 1 and 2. If acquisition is made prior to completion of bump, G bias
starts immediately for steeper impact. Continuous lase is standard with
PW III since energy loss is not a factor as with PW II. If you do not want
fast track, delay lasing until initialization is complete. Fast track may
cause the bomb to enter clouds and lose track.

Mode 3 Delivery

This mode was designed to provide a low altitude delivery (below

8000 feet) against a horizontal or vertical hard target such as runways or
hardened command and control facilities (Figure D-22). This mode allows
the aircrew to deliver the weapon with ceilings as low as 2000 feet, if 500
foot AGL run-in altitude is used to deliver the weapon. At weapon
release, the bomb performs a bump-up maneuver of 1100 feet to
approximately 1600 feet AGL and enters an altitude-hold mode similar to
Mode 1. The guidance package enters into a box scan and searches for
laser energy. After acquisition, the weapon enters a gimbal angle hold
mode where the control system tries to establish and hold a 27° look-down
angle between the weapon centerline and seeker line of sight. Impact
angles of 35-40° are achieved against horizontal targets and 50-55°
against vertical targets.

Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_49.jpeg:
At longer acquisition ranges, the weapon may even climb to establish the
27° look down. As the weapon approaches the target, a point is reached
where its maneuver limit is met. At this point, the weapon pushes over to
center the seeker head, i.e., flies toward the target. Approximately

7.5 seconds later the canards are limited to 5° of deflection to reduce AOA
at impact. Impact angles of 35° to 40° can be achieved from a 500 foot
level delivery. If weather and defenses allow, much higher impact angles
against horizontal hard targets can be achieved by increasing the
weapon's release altitude.

A medium to high altitude delivery option was added to Mode 3 increasing
the weapons versatility (Figure D-23). In the medium to high altitude
arena, the weapon has the capability to destroy hardened vertical targets.
Above 8000 feet MSL, the weapon searches for laser energy with a box
scan. At acquisition, the weapon pushes over to enter a 17° terminal glide
all the way to the target. Canard limiting is also used in this mode to
decrease AOA just prior to impact.

It is better to release the weapon near the rear of the envelope in Modes 3
and 4 to provide better biases and end game results. There is no
advantage to pressing the front of the envelope as a GBU-24 always has

Mode 4 Delivery

This mode is very similar to Mode 3 with one major exception. After
release below 8000 feet, the weapon climbs 2500 feet above release
altitude and enters an altitude-hold mode to attack horizontal targets. An
additional requirement for this mode is a 3500 foot ceiling (Figure D-24).
Again, at acquisition the gimbal angle hold of 27° is initiated. Trajectory
shaping through the pushover maneuver and higher altitude result in
impact angles of 45° to 50° versus Mode 3 impact angles of only 35° to 40°.

A medium to high altitude delivery option was also incorporated into
Mode 4 adding another method for the weapon to penetrate horizontal
hardened targets. Like Mode 3, at weapon release above 8000 feet MSL,
the weapon enters a box scan and pushes over to 17°. Instead of
maintaining 17° through impact as in Mode 3, at acquisition the weapon
starts a trajectory shaping routine that may be level flight or even a slight
climb to maximize impact angle (55° to 60°, 70° max) (Figure D-25).

Delivery Profile Summary

The delivery options of the GBU-24 seem numerous and somewhat
confusing. To simplify the thought process a bit:

@ Mode 1 is used for soft targets with adaptive midcourse profiles based
on delivery parameters.

@ Mode 2 uses the same flight profiles as Mode 1, but the break altitude
is reduced to 10,000 feet and terminal guidance was added to limit
canard deflection and increases the weapon’s penetration.

@ Modes 3 and 4 are completely different level delivery modes adding
four additional trajectories for the GBU-24. The break altitude is now
8000 feet. One profile is for vertical targets, two are for horizontal
targets and one can be used for either vertical or horizontal targets.

@ See Section G for mode comparisons and quick reference summary
pullouts.

@ The MK-84 bomb body can be used in Modes 2 through 4 if the
BLU-109 is selected on the guidance unit (WGU-12B/B).

LLLGB Employment Considerations

GBU-24s have no backup ballistic delivery option. If the target is not
illuminated or the guidance system fails, the weapon will not impact the
target. Ifa backup ballistic capability is desired, consider using Paveway
I or II LGBs.

A GBU-24 may lose the laser spot because of laser turnoff, airframe
blanking or blockage caused by clouds or terrain. At acquisition loss the
seeker stares at the target for 2.5 seconds and if there is no reacquisition,
enters a lost acquisition routine. This attempts to maneuver the weapon
close to the target, but impact may not occur close enough for target
destruction.

GBU-24 performance envelopes have been developed for level, miniloft,
loft or dive deliveries. With GBU-24 on the aircraft, the mode must be
selected on the PACS load page and the A/G weapon delivery submenu
contains entries for desired ground range, time-to-lase and loft angle
(Figure D-27).

GBU-24s are loaded from page 5 on the PACS load page. GBU-24

(PB #14) is only for mode 1. GBU-24A (PB #13) allows MODE SELECT to
appear at PB #7 (after station loading), which cycles the mode under the
boxed, loaded stations (MS-1 to MS-4). The GBU-24s are then
programmed as usual on the PACS program page. CDIP is not an option.
Usually AUTO is selected on the PACS and DIRECT is optioned in the
front cockpit by taking command of the HUD (A/G master mode) and
going aft on the auto acq switch. This action changes AUTO to DIRECT
on the PACS page as well as on the HUD.

The A/G delivery page is then used to set the weapon parameters. Loft 0°
is used for all but loft deliveries. TARM is not an option at PB #6.

Desired ground range (DGR) is set at PB #7 and is the release range for
an AUTO delivery. In DIRECT the pickle button is hot and DGR is not
considered.

Lase time is usually continuous, but 12, 15 or 20 seconds are options.
Times are entered through the scratch pad; type “C” for continuous.
Release data for other lase times has not been calculated and cannot be
entered.

GBU-28A/B Hard Target Penetrator

The GBU-28A/B is a 4700 pound precision laser guided weapon intended
for use against fixed, high value, hardened, horizontal or near-horizontal
targets. The round consists of a penetration warhead with a guidance
unit and airfoil group attached. Major components of the item are shown
in Figure D-29 and are discussed below. Each Paveway weapon
configuration is marked with a color identification to match the major
components (guidance unit, wing assembly and canards) for that
configuration. The GBU-28A/B assigned color is white.

Figure D - 29. GBU-28A/B (BLU-113A/B).

The GBU-28A/B may be configured with either the BLU-113/B or
BLU-113A/B warhead. The BLU-113/B is the designation for the initial
warhead constructed of Howitzer gun barrels welded to nose and aft
pieces. The BLU-113A/B is a later version produced from a one-piece
forging. The basic dimensions and mass properties of the two warheads
are identical, as are the guidance and aircraft interfaces.

Fuzing

For both warheads, fuzing is by a single, tail-mounted FMU-1438()/B fuze
system with selection of 30ms (F/B), 60ms (G/B) or 120ms (H/B) functional
delay. Fuze electrical power is provided by the FZU-32B/B initiator. Fuze
lanyards are packaged with the fuze system.

D-51 AGW-3


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_58.jpeg:
Guidance and Control

The GCU contains a sensitive laser seeker, a GEU and a control section.
No electrical interface is required by the delivery aircraft. System power
is provided by a self-contained thermal battery that is lanyard activated
at the time of weapon release. Inertial reference is provided by a roll gyro
and pitch/yaw gyro activated at release. Fundamental guidance is
obtained by detection and generation of LOS error signals from the
reflected, pulsed laser energy applied to a selected target. The LOS error
signals are processed by the autopilot into guidance commands that, in
turn, drive the two-axis control canards. Power to the canards is provided
by pressurized gas. Target pressure altitude and laser coding are set on
the control unit (Figure D-30). Altitude options are from -2000 ft (A1) to
13,750 ft (H8) target pressure altitude in 250 ft increments. Altitude
selection is critical. When in doubt, use a lower estimate.

The GBU-28A/B weapon software, operational flight program (OFP),
guides the weapon to the laser spot by providing commands to control
weapon and seeker movement. The weapon transitions through four
distinct phases of flight: munition separation, midcourse, terminal
guidance and command limiting. Figure D-31 shows a graphical overview
of the weapon guidance and control from release to target impact.

AGW-3 C-2


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_60.jpeg:
The munition separation phase is approximately 2 seconds long and
allows for the weapon to fall safely away from the release aircraft before
the weapon’s actuator becomes active. During munition separation, the
OFP will go through an initialization process, exercise the control actuator
valves, and begin estimation of flight parameters. Estimation of flight
parameters is performed by processing data provided by onboard sensors.
At the end of munition separation, the OFP will initiate firing of the gas
bottle squib to activate the weapon’s actuator. Although it can be
delivered from level flight or a loft profile, level flight is preferred. The
weapon should be launched as high and as fast as possible.

Midcourse is the phase of flight when the weapon is searching for the
target. The OFP generates commands to cause the seeker to look down
10°. The OFP generates a pull down command of 12° until the weapon
reaches a dive angle of 60° or acquires the target. The weapon transitions
from midcourse to terminal when the weapon acquires the target.

During terminal guidance, the OFP uses the LOS angles from the seeker
to estimate LOS rates. Guidance commands are generated using biased
proportional navigation.

At approximately 1 second before impact, the weapon transitions from

terminal guidance to AOA control. During AOA control, the guidance
commands are limited and rate damping is used to minimize impact AOA.

AGW-3 D- 54


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_61.jpeg:
Rate damping is employed at various times throughout the flight to
minimize body angular rates. Rate damping is employed for 1 second as
the weapon transitions from munition separation to midcourse, for

1 second as the weapon transitions from midcourse to terminal, and for
the last 10 seconds of flight. Additionally, rate damping is employed
anytime the estimated body angular rates are larger than 75° per second.

The GBU-28A/B time line is shown in Table D-3.

Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_62.jpeg:
Hard Target Penetration

Target penetration is a function of the weapon’s velocity, impact angle and
AOA at impact. Impact angle is the angle between the weapon’s velocity
vector and the target plane. The best penetration is achieved when the
impact angle is 90°. AOA is the angle between the weapon’s velocity
vector and the longitudinal axis of the weapon. The best penetration is
achieved when the AOA is 0°.

The GBU-28A/B guidance algorithms are designed to maximize the
impact angle and minimize impact AOA. These are discussed further

below.

Impact Angle

Impact angle is maximized by:
@ Aircraft releasing the weapon from high altitude.
@ Weapon executing midcourse pull-down maneuver.

The steepest impact angles are achieved when the weapon is released
near the front edge of the release envelope.

Angle of Attack (AOA)

Impact AOA is minimized by:

@ Using LOS rate bias to put the weapon on the ballistic path to the
target.

@ Employing rate damping to minimize body angular rates.

@ Limiting guidance commands near impact.

The key to successful limiting guidance commands near impact is to
accurately estimate time to impact. If the guidance commands are limited
too early in the flight, the miss distance may be relatively large. If the

guidance commands are limited too late in flight then the AOA may be
relatively large.

AGW-3 D - 56


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_63.jpeg:
Guidance Command Limiting

The GBU-28A/B weapon software has two time to impact estimators. The
primary time to impact estimator uses the weapon’s estimate of altitude
and vertical velocity to estimate time to impact. The secondary time to
impact estimator is based on the time in flight when the seeker switches
to low gain (normally within one second of impact). The seeker switches
to low gain when the reflected laser light saturates the seeker.

The primary estimator is a function of the weapon’s estimate of altitude
above the target and vertical velocity. The guidance command limits are
enabled when impact is less than 1 second. At high impact speeds, the
guidance commands are limited to 0°. At low impact speeds, the guidance
commands are limited to 2°. A 2° limit will result in a significantly
smaller miss distance than a 0° limit when the limits are applied early.

Since a 0° guidance command limit will yield better penetration than a
2° guidance command limit, a secondary estimator is employed based on
the time in flight when the seeker switches to low gain. The guidance
command limits are enabled whenever impact is less than 1 second and
the guidance command limits will be set to 0° regardless of impact speed.
This estimator is considered a secondary one because the seeker may not
switch to low gain if the target reflectivity is low and/or the visibility is
low.

Target altitude is critical for the above estimators to function properly.
When in doubt, use a lower estimate.

Optimum Release Points (ORP)

ORPs were developed to provide the best chance of weapon acquisition
and guidance to the target. The ORP is at a point in the envelope where:

@ Seeker acquisition range is near the minimum required for the given
release conditions.

@ There is sufficient margin between the point and envelope edges.
@ The impact angle is near the maximum, which will provide the best

penetration for the given release condition. Therefore, the ORP for an
inclined target is different than the ORP for a horizontal target.

D-57 AGW-3


Text from AGW-3_Laser_Guided_Bombs_page_64.jpeg:
The ORP is determined by ballistic tables in TO 1-1M-34-1. The ORP is
adjusted for the head or tail component of wind at the release altitude and
entered as a desired ground range (DGR) on the A/G delivery page.

GBU-28A/B Summary

The GBU-28A/B was developed to penetrate hardened targets. It
currently has two delivery profiles, but is usually launched from level
flight as high and fast as practical.

The weapon profile is optimized for a 90° impact angle and zero AOA to
achieve maximum penetration. Software estimates of TOF, rate damping
and AOA control are used to control the profile. Setting the correct ORP
from the ballistic tables in the A/G delivery page and the correct pressure
altitude on the weapon control unit are critical to achieving a good profile.

Flight planning requirements and ballistic tables are provided in the
classified TO 1-1M-34-1.

TEXT
PAVEWAY I AND II (GBU-10/12)
Introduction

Laser-guided bombs (LGBs) are general purpose bomb bodies equipped
with electronic and mechanical assemblies that provide laser terminal

guidance. There is no electrical interface between the aircraft and any
LGB.

There are three categories of LGBs used by the USAF. Paveway I is an
early LGB with fixed wings. Paveway II LGBs are very similar but have
improved electronics, laser coding ability, increased aircraft carriage
(speed and Gs), wider field of view and better maneuverability. Paveway
III LGBs are vastly different and will be discussed separately.

Paveway II is desired for combat employment, but there are still plenty of
Paveway Is being used, especially for training. The F-15E PACS options
for the GBU-10 are Paveway II ballistics only. When dropping Paveway I
weapons, along track corrections must be applied.

Components

All LGB weapons consist of a computer control group (CCG), warhead
(bomb body and fuzes) and an airfoil group (AFG). A detailed description
of which components make up which LGB version is contained in

TO 1-1M-34.

Computer Control Group (CCG)

The CCG is composed of the seeker assembly, detector, computer and
control section, and guidance canards.

Seeker Assembly

The seeker assembly contains the detector assembly, optics and electronic
circuitry that determines the direction of the laser reflected energy and
generates appropriate error correction signals. The seeker, which is free
to move in pitch and yaw, is always streamlined into the relative wind by
a ringtailed stabilizer mounted around its circumference.

Detector

A four-quadrant, light-sensitive disk produces a very small electrical
signal when the laser spot hits it. Since the seeker is stabilized into the
relative wind, the location of the spot of light on the detector is determined
by the relative position of the target. For example, if the spot of light falls
in the upper right hand quadrant, the bomb electronics indicate the target
is down and left, relative to its present flight path. (The spot is in the
opposite quadrant due to reversal of position by the seeker lens.)

Computer and Control Section

The computer and control section process signals from the detector and
transmit directional command signals to the appropriate pair(s) of
canards. Circuitry in the computer contains the guidance logic, and in the
Paveway II, has laser coding capabilities.

A thermal battery is activated by an external lanyard when the bomb is
released. After a 2-3 second delay an electrical pulse fires the gas grain
generator. Gas from the generator is controlled through a manifold
assembly with four cylinders. A solenoid for each cylinder is controlled by
directional signals from the computer. Actuation of the solenoids permits
gas to enter the corresponding cylinder and move the pistons that are
mechanically connected to the canards.

Guidance Canards

Guidance canards are attached to each quadrant of the control unit to
change the flight path of the weapon. Opposing canards always respond
simultaneously (act in pairs) to generate up/down or left/right directional
changes. The deflections are always full scale (bang, bang guidance). The
bomb is not roll stabilized and may rotate randomly about its longitudinal
axis. The guidance computer is able to function and cope with the slow
roll rates generated.

Warhead

GBU-10 and GBU-12 LGBs can consist of any of three general purpose
bomb warheads. Each warhead contains any of the fuzes compatible with
that warhead. GBU-12s contain a standard 500 pound MK-82 bomb body.
GBU-10s can consist of either a standard 2000-pound MK-84 body or the
BLU-109/B penetrator bomb body.

Airfoil Group

The AFG consists of the adapter collar (which is bolted to the nose of the
bomb for installation of the CCG), the canards and the tail assembly. On
Paveway I weapons (Figure D-1), a fixed tail is bolted to the bomb and
extenders are bolted to the wing to form a long winged bomb (slow speed
configuration).

Profiles

Offset Pop-Up

The most common type of pop-up delivery is the offset pop, also known as
an indirect pop. This type of pop-up delivery is defined by an angle off
(AO) ranging from 15° to 90°. Remember, the difference between your
approach heading and your attack heading constitutes the angle off
(Figure D-2).

AGW-04-02

AGW-4 D-4


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_11.jpeg:
Initial Point
There are two ways to get from the IP to the PUP in an offset pop. One
choice is to fly from the IP directly to the PUP, as shown in Figure D-3.

This approach course steering initially points you to the side of the target.

PUP

AGW-04-03

Figure D - 3. IP Direct to PUP.

D-5 AGW-4


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_12.jpeg:
The other choice is to depart the IP and fly directly at the target. Then, at
a given range from the target, execute a check turn left or right for offset
(the point where the turn is started is the action point), delay as required
and then pop-up (Figure D-4).

IP ACTION POINT

AGW-04-04

Figure D - 4. IP Direct to Target.

Although it looks more complicated, this choice is often quicker to plan
and is the more common choice among aircrews. It is sometimes referred
to as a “whip pop.” It also can be flown from any attack direction, without
the need to overfly the IP, simply by putting the target on the nose and
actioning at the planned range. This option can be useful for reattacks,
especially after threat reactions.

Advantages

The offset pop-up has several advantages. First, target acquisition is
simplified because during the climb to pull-down altitude the target is not
hidden under the nose of the aircraft, and you have time to look for the
target. Second, as you acquire the target in the climb, you are able to see
any corrections needed to achieve the correct parameters. Third, it
enables you to maneuver the aircraft three dimensionally, making it
difficult for target area threats to track you.

AGW-4 D-6


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_13.jpeg:
Disadvantages

Reliance on a faulty INS or timing errors could place you in unacceptable
parameters, i.e., inside the MAP when rolling out to begin tracking. Make
every attempt to use easily identifiable visual references for the IP, action
point and PUP. Second, the maneuver may expose you to the heart of the
enemy defenses. Hence, you do not want to increase your tracking time
beyond the minimum needed to accurately get weapons on target and
thereby increase your exposure to the enemy.

Direct Pop-Up

The second type of pop-up delivery is called the direct pop-up because the
final approach course to the pull-up-point (PUP) is within 0-15° of the
planned attack axis, which gives you a 0-15° angle off (Figure D-5). Even

though a direct pop may be up to 15° angle off, they are normally flown at
zero degrees angle-off (target on the nose).

D-7 AGW-4


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_14.jpeg:
The direct pop-up is an instrument maneuver; no attempt is made to
visually acquire the target until rolled out on final. Direct pops can be
accomplished in AUTO or CDIP. In practice, you will usually see this type
of delivery called a LAT (low-altitude toss), which is a modified direct pop-
up performed in AUTO where you pickle and start a pull prior to bomb
release. A typical direct pop-up pattern is depicted in Figure D-6.

PULL-UP

4.5NM _ TGT

AGW-04-06

Figure D - 6. Direct Pop-Up Profile.

You must approach the pull-up point with a good designation (RDR or
TGT IR). The AUTO designation and ASL will help with the rollout and
target acquisition. At the computed pull-up point begin a wings level 4 Gs
in 2 second climb to the planned climb angle. Relax the climb G
approximately 2-3° prior to reaching the desired climb angle to avoid
overshooting. (The WSO may be able to acquire the target during the
climb and redesignate with the TGT POD). At the computed roll-in
altitude, unload and roll to wings level inverted. Then, smoothly pull 4 Gs
in 2 seconds. In the roll and pull over the top, you may have displaced the
ASL a few degrees opposite your roll direction. Ensure your pull is
parallel to the ASL, not toward it. Approximately 5° prior to reaching the
desired dive angle unload the aircraft, roll into the ASL, steady out on
your dive angle and then look to acquire the target. During the roll to
upright you will lose 3-5°, thus putting you at the desired dive angle. If
you rolled out with the same G as you rolled in (1 G being desired), and in
the same direction, the ASL should be centered. If it is not, turn toward
the ASL as you attempt to acquire the target. As an alternative, a 0.5 G
bunt may be used to transition from the climb to the dive but this must be
well planned, since it will affect the pull-up range and the bunt altitude.

AGW-4 D-8


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_15.jpeg:
If you are using an AUTO delivery you can either bomb the designated
target (pickle and pull up the ASL) or, if the designation is off,
undesignate and redesignate the target visually. If the target is acquired
with the AUTO reticle short of the target, undesignate, track the pipper to
the target and redesignate. Then follow the ASL pulling 2-4 G’s. Bomb
release will occur while you are in the pull.

If the reticle is long of the target at acquisition and the designation is
inaccurate, you have two options. The first option is to select CDIP via
HOTAS and visually designate the target with the CDIP pipper, if you are
still above pickle altitude. If the CDIP pipper is already past the target or
you are below release altitude, then go through dry. On the next pass
increase the pull-up range.

Advantages / Disadvantages

Essentially, a direct pop is the only way you can visually identify a target

(through the NAV FLIR) at night (low level ingress) when you do not have
a TGT IR pod. It also has an advantage when compared to an indirect pop
in having the least exposure time. However, it has several disadvantages.

First, it requires precise instrument flying and an accurate designation.
Errors in either of the above could lead to the target not being in the FLIR
FOV upon rollout. This may force an abort since the extent of your errors
cannot be determined until after the rollout.

Second, the target cannot be seen visually during the climb. Time is
critical to attempt to identify the target and correct any designation errors
once rolled out.

Common Errors

e Pulling up or down with less than the computed G putting you inside
the MAP

e Attempting to acquire the target while inverted/during rollout

e Not using unloaded rolls resulting in large azimuth deviations (target
no longer in HUD field of view)

e  =Rolling out in opposite direction than that used to roll in, causing

e Attempting to center the ASL during inverted pull-down

Pop-to-Level

A third type of pop-up delivery is the pop-to-level (Figure D-7). It is used
when a very low altitude approach is desired to minimize threat exposure.
The crew climbs close to the target to achieve fuze arming, safe escape,
safe separation, weapon effects or visual acquisition in a level release
profile. The climb is a 5 Gin 2 second pull to a climb angle equal to the
number of feet to climb divided by 100 (i.e., 2000 ft to climb - use 20°).

The pushover should begin at 40 ft per degree of climb angle below the
bombing altitude (i.e., 400 ft prior for a 10° climb, 800 ft prior for a 20°
climb). This delivery is often planned as a weather backup (ceiling too low
for planned delivery but high enough to allow frag clearance).

Advantages

This maneuver enables the crew to drop a low drag bomb using a level
delivery under low ceilings. Second, it allows you to clear the
fragmentation, achieve the desired fuze arming times and achieve the
desired impact angle. Third, popping-to-level aids in target acquisition by
letting you get higher, particularly if the target has little or no vertical
development.

AGW-4 D-10


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_17.jpeg:
Disadvantages

The first disadvantage of the pop-to-level maneuver is that climbing out of
the low level environment exposes you to the enemy defenses, and if a
straight ahead egress is executed, overflight of the target and defenses
adds to the exposure. Second, the length of time maintaining straight and
level at release altitude gives the enemy gunners a fairly predictable
target. Therefore, the amount of time at release altitude should be kept to
a minimum, similar to the angular deliveries (5 seconds is ideal). Also,
frag may cause problems for you or for a wingman in trail, forcing him to a
higher altitude or more time between aircraft to ensure frag deconfliction
(covered in detail in TAC-2).

Aborts

Any pop-up maneuver should be aborted if any of the following conditions
occur:

Actual pull-up point inside planned pull-up point (for FTU/MQT
students)

Roll-in pointed at wrong target (no changing targets after roll-in to
final) (for FTU/MQT students)

Roll-in requires more than 90° or less than 15° of turn, except for
direct pop-up (for FTU/MQT students)

Airspeed below 350 KIAS (300 KIAS above 10,000 ft AGL)

Actual dive angle exceeds planned dive angle by more than 5° (10° if
recovery altitude is above 10,000 AGL)

Target is not positively identified
Satisfactory entry/release conditions are not achieved
Discernible horizon reference is lost

Aircraft passes below the minimum release altitude

POP-UP PLANNING

There is a positive correlation between the quality of your planning and
the quality of execution. The more effort spent in mission planning, the
easier in-flight execution becomes.

Planning With Auto Systems

The F-15E, with its computed modes (AUTO/CDIP), is capable of dropping
accurate bombs at practically any combination of altitude, dive angle and
airspeed. However, if actual release parameters differ from planned
conditions, fuze arming times, weapons effects, dive recovery and/or safe
escape criteria may not be met.

Adhere to planned release parameters in order to
e ensure safe separation.

e ensure fuze arming.

e achieve desired weapons effect.

e provide frag clearance.

@ provide ground clearance.

Steps in Planning an Attack

There are several steps involved when planning a pop-up attack. The first
and most important step is to calculate a minimum release altitude
(MRA). This is to keep you from killing yourself during the delivery! The
MRA is based on the highest of safe escape, safe separation, vertical drop
required for fuze arm, altitude lost during dive recovery and an altitude
that gives the desired weapons effect. The second step is to plan the
actual pop-up maneuver and planned release altitude (above the MRA)
based on computed release conditions. These computations are made
using the Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS). The final step is
to take the planned attack, and put it onto paper so that it can be used in
the cockpit. The following sample problem illustrates this flow.

Enter the coordinates and elevations for the Target and IP. Ensure the
TDA is correct. Three TDA modes are available (““Elev/Temp,” “Density

when they are entered, CWDS will automatically calculate the TDA which
is used by the computer to determine safe escape data and weapons
ballistics.

Wind Model Data

Wind model data can be entered (from the initial input page) by selecting
“Options” and “Wind Model....” You may now select one of three options
(“None,” “Ballistic” or “F-15E”). An important planning note is that Safe
Escape will not be computed in your attack calculation if you select any
wind model option other than “None.”

Ballistics Tables /Safe Escape Tables

Before calculating the actual minimum release altitude for your delivery,
you should look at the ballistics tables for the ordnance, delivery and safe
escape maneuver combination you plan on employing. These ballistics
tables are produced using the CWDS program. (The flying squadrons may
still have copies of the outdated ballistics manuals, but remember that the
CWDS program is the only currently authorized version for weapons
ballistics.)

in the increments you desire for calculating the tables. With this
information, the CWDS program will produce tables which can be
previewed on screen or printed (see Table D-1) to compare with the results
obtained when CWDS calculates an MRA for your planned delivery
profile. This will provide a safety check to ensure the delivery will work
as planned and not result in either a “dud” weapon or “fragging” yourself.
Care must be taken to ensure the correct ordnance and delivery profiles
are used.

Safe escape tables can also be calculated in CWDS. From the initial input
page, select “Tables” and “Safe Escape....” Enter the type of Escape
Maneuver to be flown from the list of options (“No Safe Escape,” “Lvl Cnst
Spd No Turn,” “5G Climb Maneuver,” “5G Turn Maneuver,” or “5G Turn
(Lvl Turn)”). Once selected, CWDS calculates a series of tables that cover
many dive angle and airspeed combinations for both single and multiple
releases of the selected weapon. Tables are produced for both 0’ and 5000’
TDA. Again, use these tables as a “sanity check” for your planned
delivery to ensure it can be accomplished safely.

Delivery Options

The next step is to input the rest of the data needed to compute a delivery.
Select “Delivery” to get into the delivery options submenu. To plan a pop-
up delivery, select “Dive...,” which takes you to the Dive Delivery page.
Once entered, the next screen looks like Figure D-11.

This is where the remainder of the inputs are entered including: the type
of “Entry” (None, Pop-Up, Fly-up, Bunt Pop, Direct Pop), “Wing Pos/Dist”
from lead (None, Left, Right), dive angle, airspeeds, tracking time, G and
onset rates for the maneuver, and “Attack Options” (Distance/Heading,
Distance/Angle, Angle/Heading). Distance/Angle is a common one to use
when you wish to select an action range based on a specific distance from
a target to the action point (INS ground range makes this easily readable
in the HUD) and a desired angle off (as in this example). A good rule of
thumb for angle off is somewhere between 2 X climb angle (minimum
angle off) and 80° to allow room for any repositioning maneuvers. Most
sets of plotters used to draw pop-up attacks include templates for 45° (for
10° deliveries) and 60° (for 20° deliveries) of angle off. “Action Distance”
and “Angle-Off” can be directly entered on this page. Also on this page is
a list of possible options for the desired safe escape maneuver. A final
input (and the one that causes the most confusion) is the desired “Release
Alt Mode,” which determines how CWDS calculates the minimum release
altitude (MRA) you will use for the attack.

Calculating the Minimum Release Altitude (MRA)

As mentioned earlier, the minimum release altitude is the highest of safe
escape altitude, safe separation altitude, altitude required for fuze
arming, altitude required for dive recovery or altitude required for
weapons effect.

Safe Escape Warning

When using CWDS to plan weapon deliveries at minimum release
conditions, deviations from planned delivery/recovery conditions may
result in a significant increase in the risk of self-fragmentation.

Therefore, the aircrew must observe the appropriate delivery parameters,
minimum release altitudes and recovery maneuvers required for safe
escape/separation. Additionally, the CWDS program computes safe escape
data based on self-fragmentation. For leader/other aircraft frag
deconfliction, minimum recovery altitudes from the Maximum
Bomb/Rocket Fragment Travel Chart (TO 1-1M-34) must be used or
additional deconfliction is required.

AGW-4 D - 22


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_29.jpeg:
Release Altitude Computation

When planning a minimum release altitude, always plan for the worst
case. The following technique will ensure you will be able to deliver your
weapons safely. Since an attack can be continued up to 5° steep, a good
technique is to plan for a delivery that is 5° steeper than you actually
desire. In this example, we are planning a 20° delivery, so we will
compute the MRA using 25°.

CWDS provides three altitude options: “Specific Alt,” “Min Rec Alt,” or a
“Planned Rel Altitude.” For initial computation of MRA, use "Planned
Rel Altitude " and a low “Min Recovery/Release” altitude (1000A for
example) to ensure the program forces a calculated MRA that is above
your input. A “Variable Parameter” window now appears, allowing you to
select “Airspeed,” “Dive Angle,” or “Press Time” as a variable to
compensate for errors in arriving at the release point. Select “Dive Angle”
and enter 0° in the deviation field, as you have already allowed for a 5°
steep delivery.

NOTE

CWDS will also compute the same MRA if you enter your planned dive
angle (20 in the example) and 5° as the deviation. However, this
method only shows data for the entered dive angle, not for the 5° steep

pass. Although the MRA provided by CWDS is still correct, you will not
be able to determine upon what constraint (such as fuze arming, safe
escape, etc.) the MRA is based.

When all data is entered, you may preview or print the resulting data by
selecting “Preview Output” or “Print Output” at the bottom of the page. It
is strongly advised that you check the output on the screen (before you try
to print the final results) to ensure it passes the “common sense test.” The
output will appear like Table D-2 with the MRA information (altitude and
driving factor) near the end.

Notice the computer is even “smart enough” to change some of your inputs
automatically (in this example, Fuze Arm Time) to meet all criteria (safe
escape, safe separation, etc.). Ensure these changes are made known to
the rest of the flight and maintenance if any weapons settings are
affected! The information in Table D-2 was computed using the “Planned
Rel” option with 5° steep as an input.

Delivery Altitude “Pad”

Up to this point, calculations have only been made for release at the MRA.
It is very important to note the MRA numbers given in the MRA section of
the CWDS printout are for an unpadded release. Since any problems
(target acquisition, lining up on the target, etc.) can cause a delay in
dropping the weapons, it would be easy to go below the MRA if trying to
pickle right at the minimum altitude. For this reason, you need to “pad”
your release altitude (i.e. you should plan to release at a specific altitude
high enough to allow you some sort of “pad” or press factor).

One of the simplest techniques available to compute a “pad,” and a good
rule of thumb for “press” is to add an altitude equal to your planned dive
angle X 30 (600 feet for a 20° diving delivery). Another common technique
is to add an altitude equal to the amount lost in two seconds of track time.
This is calculated by the formula of 2 seconds X true airspeed X 1.69 X
sine of the dive angle (2 X 500 X 1.69 X 0.3420 = 578 feet for this
example). The sine of the dive angle is obtained from Table D-3. Notice
the results are similar.

Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_34.jpeg:
You will want to obtain a final CWDS printout for the planned delivery
with your desired “press” factor added in to use in putting your attack on
paper (map or attack card). This can be done by going back to the Dive
Delivery page, inputting the planned dive angle (20° in this example), and
changing the “Release Alt Mode” to “Specific Alt.” Enter an altitude that
is higher than the previously calculated minimum release altitude by your
“press” factor. Using the rule of thumb in the last paragraph, 4000A
would work well for this example (3393A computed unpadded release
altitude from CWDS output plus 600’).

It is important to note for this example that you must go back to the
initial input page and increase the fuze arm time to 6 seconds to meet the
safe separation required for the radar fuze. (This is changed
automatically when using the “Planned Rel” mode, but not when using the
“Specific Alt” mode.) The final attack you have planned is now shown in
Table D-4.

Ripple Release

If a ripple release is desired, number of weapons to drop, type of drop
(string for ripple single or multiple for ripple multiple) and impact spacing
need to be entered on the Dive Delivery page. These factors should be
input at the beginning of the planning process (calculating the MRA) to
ensure the planned release altitude is based on the ripple release. The
output is essentially the same through release and weapon conditions,
where the first, last, and center bomb ranges, altitudes and times of flight
will be listed. The center of stick ranges are used for calculating the MAP
(Table D-5).

Plotting the Attack

Drawing the Attack on Charts

Once release conditions have been calculated and are known, start
plotting out the pop-up attack on a map. Accuracy is critical during the
planning and plotting and the more accurately planned, the better the
results during the execution will tend to be.

First, find the bomb range under Weapon Conditions. The MAP, aim off
distance and the Track/Map Altitude are found in Tracking Information.
The release altitude is found in Release Conditions. With these values, we
can plot the bombing triangle (Figure D-12).

Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_46.jpeg:
From the bomb triangle, we shift to a “God’s Eye” view and begin plotting
the attack on a chart. Normally, a 1:50,000 or a 1:24,000 chart is used for
attack planning (if available). With the God’s eye view, start at the target
and work out. Begin by drawing a circle around the target at the MAP

distance and a line out from the target to the MAP on the desired attack
axis as shown in Figure D-13.

Next, from the ROLL-IN/PULL-DOWN DATA section, find the ROLL-
IN/PULL-DOWN TURN RADIUS. This is normally between 4000' and

5000' depending on how aggressive the maneuver over the top is (4.5 or
3.5 Gs).

Finally, when planning and plotting an IP direct to target/action point
offset pop-up attack, the CWDS program may not compute the proper turn
radius at the action point. This may result in a tight pop-up attack and
the perception of popping late. To help alleviate this problem, work from
the target, to the MAP, to the ROLL-IN, to the PULL-UP point and then

back to the action point. Also, remember the more precisely planned and
plotted, the better the results will be.

Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_50.jpeg:
Templates

Pop-up planning templates are available in many squadrons and often
pilots or WSOs have their own pop-up templates. Exercise caution when
using these templates because you are trusting someone else’s work and
all the assumptions they made when building the template. Be especially
careful, that it is the same scale as the map that you are using! You must
still calculate the numbers (using CWDS) for your weapon types, delivery
and conditions to ensure the attack can be flown as plotted. Plan a good
attack and fly the attack as it is planned!

Attack Card Preparation

Once the attack has been planned and plotted, it must be put into a usable
format for the cockpit. First, draw the attack on the map and convert the
AGL numbers to MSL numbers (Figure D-17). One way to get a cockpit
usable format is just to reduce the map the attack is drawn on. This can
be done on a copy machine. This is the quickest and simplest method of
making an attack planning card. However, due to coordinate grids,
contour lines, target depictions, etc., it could become cluttered and hard to
read once shrunk down.

An alternate to this method is a “Thumbnail Sketch” attack card. This
attack card reduces the map into a hand drawing depicting the essential
geographical features (Figure D-18). This takes longer, but is more
readable in the cockpit. Other attack cards may be more or less elaborate
depending on the target area and visual references available.

POP-UP POSITIONING ERRORS

The most common error that necessitates a repositioning maneuver is a
missed PUP caused by inadequate mission planning, navigation errors,
unfamiliar terrain, weather and/or defensive reactions due to threats. If
the PUP is missed, three things must happen. First, recognize that you
are not on planned parameters. Second, assess whether you have
sufficient turning room to complete the attack. Third, assess whether a
repositioning maneuver is required.

Five broad categories of errors exist that require repositioning. They are
outside PUP, outside planned run-in, inside PUP, inside planned run-in,
and inside PUP and run-in.

Outside PUP

If you initiate the pop too soon, as seen in Figure D-19, the options are:

LEGEND

ACTUAL

——— PLANNED

AGW-04-19

Figure D - 19. Outside PUP.

e Reduce G and climb angle, pull-down at a slightly higher than planned
altitude and intercept the planned dive angle and attack axis (best
solution due to flying to the preplanned parameters).

D - 47 AGW-4


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_54.jpeg:
e Pull-down at the planned altitude and accept a longer track time,
lower dive angle and new attack axis.

e Check away from the target, pull-down at a higher altitude, and
intercept the planned dive angle at a lower airspeed and further from

the target thereby increasing tracking time.

e Reduce angle-off by turning toward the target (use care not to have
less than 15° AO).

e All are acceptable; however, they all increase exposure time.
Outside Planned Run-In

If you are outside the planned run-in line when you pop, you can (see
Figure D-20):

e Angle into the roll-in point during the pull-up and pull-down at the

parameters).

AGW-4 D - 48


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_55.jpeg:
Pull-down at a higher altitude and intercept the planned dive angle at
a lower airspeed and further from the target. This increases tracking
time.

Pull-down at the planned altitude and accept a shallower dive angle
with more tracking time and on a different attack axis.

Inside PUP

If you are past the planned PUP (Figure D-21), you only have a few
choices:

Pull to a higher climb angle, pull-down slightly early and intercept the
planned attack (this takes aircraft back to preplanned parameters).

Check away to use lateral turning room, pull down slightly late and
accept the increased track time.

Pull-down early and accept a shallow dive angle, more tracking time
and a different attack heading.

Abort the attack (here at F-15E FTU, this is the correct choice).

LEGEND

AGW-04-21

Figure D - 21. Inside PUP.

D - 49 AGW-4


Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_56.jpeg:
Inside Planned Run-In

A pop initiated inside the planned run-in line (Figure D-22) may be
correctable if the problem is not severe and recognized early.

e Immediately turn back toward the planned track and intercept it prior
to pull-down (best solution due to flying to the same roll-in point and
preplanned parameters). Attack axis is farther around the MAP; abort
if angle off exceeds 90°.

e Ifyou are well inside the run-in line or you recognize it late, reposition
outside the planned run-in line because of the additional turning room
required to bring the nose back to the correct aim off distance at the
track point.

e Abort the attack if satisfactory entry/release parameters are not
achieved.

Text from AGW-4_Pop-Up_Attacks_page_57.jpeg:
Inside PUP and Run-In
The worst situation is to be inside the planned run-in line and

pull-up-point (Figure D-23).
The best option is to stay low, egress the area, and then reattack, hit

e
an alternate target, or return to base.
If you are forced to attack, a 180° reversal may be required (not an

e
option at F-15E FTU).

CREW COORDINATION
Individual Duties

As in other mission phases, crew coordination duties during low level,
weapons delivery, etc. should be addressed during the crew briefing.
However, these delineations must be flexible enough for adjustments
when required by the situation and/or individual preference.

Pilot Duties

During pop-up attacks, it is the pilot’s primary duty to fly the planned
attack and deliver ordnance on the target. To do this, the pilot must
achieve the correct release parameters for the maneuver being flown so as
to achieve the desired weapons effects and to avoid fragging himself or his
wingman. The pilot must also evaluate the designation and redesignate if
required. They will also set the FCP switches in accordance with the
appropriate checklist. As always, not hitting the ground is of primary
importance. If threats become a factor, the pilot will maneuver the
aircraft as necessary.

WSO Duties

In general, the WSO will perform all functions and duties that are not
performed by the pilot. These include initial designations, switch changes,
PACS functions, UFC inputs, A/A and A/G radar operations, TFR changes,
and other duties required to strike the target that can be performed in the
RCP. The WSO has primary responsibility for threat lookout and
countermeasures employment. The WSO must also maintain mutual
support with other flight members during the attack. The WSO should
also assist the pilot in target acquisition and maneuver accomplishment, if
possible. This possibly includes “talking the pilot’s eyes onto the target,”
calling altitudes/ airspeeds/dive angle, and monitoring safe escape. This
should not interfere with the WSOs lookout responsibilities. As always,
not hitting the ground is of primary importance.

Mission Element Duties

Prior to the IP

The WSO keeps the navigation platform updated in both position and
velocity so a NAV designation will be as accurate as possible. The WSO or
the pilot clears the target area with the A/A radar and prepares for the
final designation, if required. The pilot flies the aircraft and ensures
ground clearance.

The pilot normally stays in the NAV master mode, although this is not
absolutely required, until just prior to the IP in order to work timing and
get steering to the IP in case the WSO designates early. Strive to be at
the IP on time so you can concentrate on flying the planned attack and not
worry about making timing corrections IP to target. At or just prior to the
IP, the pilot should select A/G master mode and turn the master arm on if
it is not already armed. The WSO checks the PACS for proper
programming and a RDY indication. The WSO should also confirm the
VTRS is recording and the TEWS is set. Both the pilot and WSO should
review the planned attack and be mentally prepared to fly it.

IP to Target

IP to target, the pilot’s main job is to fly the attack. The pilot must
maneuver the aircraft, as required, to put bombs on the target which
means flying the planned attack as closely as possible. The pilot should
use both the aircraft systems and visual/timing reference points to find
the pull-up point and the target. If a final designation is required, the
WSO should get it as soon as possible and give the radar/command of the
HUD to the pilot. The WSOs primary responsibility now becomes
defensive. This includes visual lookout, maintaining mutual support as
much as possible, TEWS employment and terrain clearance. The WSO
gives the pilot any assistance deemed necessary to properly execute the
attack (or that was briefed during crew coordination) such as an “UP” call
at the pull-up point, a “pull-down” call at pull-down altitude, etc. The
WSO should be especially cognizant of minimum release altitudes for safe
escape. The pilot should keep the current designation until the target is
sighted and the aircraft is in position to deliver ordnance. The pilot may
then undesignate and/or thumb aft to CDIP, as required.

Egress

After weapons release, the pilot must complete the planned safe escape
maneuver. The pilot may select auto guns to enhance radar look-out and
prepare for a possible air-to-air engagement. The pilot also needs to be
careful about buddy locks, which may set off the wingman’s RWR. As
always, the pilot’s main job is terrain avoidance. After completion of the
safe escape maneuver, the pilot flies the planned egress routing and
regains mutual support. Once clear of the target area and mutual support
has been regained, the pilot should return control of the radar to the
WSO. During the safe escape maneuver, the WSO should continue visual
look-out and maintain mutual support. The WSO may need to talk the
pilot’s eyes onto other formation members or direct maneuvers to regain
mutual support, and take command of the radar. The WSO should
initially clear the egress routing in SRM and then MRM. The WSO
should also check the PACS and confirm any remaining/hung ordnance.

POP-UP ATTACKS
Introduction

The objective of tactical fighter operations in air interdiction missions is to
delay, neutralize or destroy the military potential of the enemy before it
can be effectively brought to bear against friendly forces. Deception and
surprise are two invaluable ingredients in achieving success in any attack.
They both can be achieved to some degree when a pop-up delivery is used
in conjunction with a low level approach.

A pop-up attack allows an aircraft to ingress low altitude, then reposition
to a visual high or low drag weapon release profile and get back into the
low altitude environment with minimal exposure. This attack profile
enhances visual acquisition of the target and helps in satisfying weapons
effects, dive recovery, safe separation and safe escape requirements.
While in the pop-up profile, the aircraft is maneuvering in three
dimensions, making enemy tracking difficult; but pop-up attacks require
precise planning and execution to ensure target destruction and
survivability of your own aircraft.

Terms
The following terms are illustrated in Figure D-1.

Initial Point (IP)

The point along the low level route where the air-to-ground target attack
commences. Preferably, the IP should be a visually significant point.

Approach Heading

The heading from the initial point (IP)/action point to the pull-up point
(PUP).

Angle Off (AQ)

The angle between the extension of the approach heading and the attack
heading.

Climb Angle

The angle of climb that is to be achieved during the pull-up.
Pull-Down

A maneuver to transition from the climbing to the diving portion of a
pop-up delivery.

Pull-Down Point

The geographical point in space where the pilot rolls the aircraft to
initiate the pull-down maneuver.

Pull-Down Altitude

The altitude at which the pilot rolls the aircraft to initiate the pull-down
maneuver.

Thermal Radiation

The intense thermal radiation generated by a nuclear detonation
comprises approximately 35 percent of the total energy released. It is
emitted as heat and light. The intensity depends upon the weapon yield.

There are effectively two surface temperature pulses. The first is of a very
short duration, and the second lasts for a much longer time (Figure D-4).

Light

The first pulse lasts about 0.1 second for a 1-megaton explosion. As a
result, much of the radiation emitted by the fireball during this pulse is in
the ultraviolet light region and is therefore not a significant heat hazard
for skin burns.

However, it is capable of producing permanent or temporary eye damage,
especially for those looking directly at the explosion. The flash from even
the smallest burst is enough to cause temporary flash blindness severe
enough to incapacitate an aircrew. This blinding flash of light is the first
manifestation of a nuclear explosion.

Text from AGW-5_Nuclear_Weapons_Introduction_page_11.jpeg:
Heat

In contrast to the first pulse, the second radiation pulse may last for
several seconds (about 10 seconds for a 1-megaton explosion) and it carries
about 99 percent of the total thermal radiation energy emitted. Most of
the rays are either visible or infrared (invisible) light.

It is this radiation which causes skin burns of various degrees to
individuals up to 12 miles away, and eye damage at even greater
distances, from the explosion of a 1-megaton weapon. Since an aircraft
can suffer heat damage from thermal radiation, this pulse becomes a safe
escape consideration in delivery planning.

Highty-five percent of the fission energy from the nuclear bomb is
converted into blast, shock, and thermal radiation. The remaining 15% is
released as various forms of nuclear radiation (Figure D-5).

Text from AGW-5_Nuclear_Weapons_Introduction_page_12.jpeg:
Nuclear Radiation

This nuclear radiation consists of alpha particles, beta particles, gamma
rays, and neutrons. Of the 15% only about 5% constitute the nuclear
radiation produced within the first minute of the explosion. The final 10%
of the total fission explosion energy represents that of the residual (or
delayed) nuclear radiation which is emitted over a period of time.

Initial Radiation

The initial nuclear radiation consists mainly of gamma rays and neutrons.
This radiation, especially gamma rays, can travel great distances through
air and can penetrate considerable thicknesses of material. Although they
can neither be seen nor felt by humans (except in very large doses which
produce a tingling sensation), the rays produce harmful effects.
Consequently, the initial nuclear radiation is an important aspect of
nuclear explosions.

Residual Radiation

The residual or delayed nuclear radiation arises from the fission products
which, in the course of their radioactive decay, emit additional gamma
rays and beta particles. Beta particles are not a factor in aircrew safe
escape. The real danger from this type of radiation is direct contact to
skin or ingestion of contaminated food or water.

Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)

The electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosion produces an
electromagnetic pulse that can cause extreme chaos in modern telephones,
radios, TVs, radars, computers, and other power systems. Groundburst
interference is confined to a relatively small area, but an airburst can
damage such facilities over enormous distances.

EMP can critically affect your aircraft. The need to coordinate strikes to

eliminate interference between our weapons and our strikers is very
important.

Relationship Between the Type of Detonation and Weapons
Effects

Airburst

The airburst (an airburst is defined as a burst where the fireball does not
touch the ground) is the most efficient use of a nuclear weapon because of
a phenomenon not found in a groundburst. In the airburst, part of the
initial shock wave travels directly down to the ground and is reflected
back into the air. The reflected wave then overtakes the horizontally
traveling initial wave (Figure D-7). The reflected wave tends to ride upon,
and reinforce, the dissipating initial wave (Figure D-8). The phenomenon
is called the MACH STEM or sometimes the MACH “Y” STEM. The burst
height cannot be excessive or the shock wave dies out prior to reaching the
ground.

AGW-05-08

Figure D - 8. Airburst with Mach “Y” Stem.

The airburst requires the greatest safe escape distance. The higher the
burst, the greater the escape distance required because the fireball, shock
wave, and radiation travel faster through the thinner air of higher
altitudes.

These factors, coupled with the MACH “Y” effects make the airburst the
most destructive. The airburst is also less dirty in terms of residue since
crater effects are not present and less radiated dust and debris are taken
up in the fireball.

Groundburst

When the fireball of a groundburst reaches the surface, much of the
energy of the burst is absorbed by the earth. Soil, rock, and debris are
vaporized and thrown into the air, resulting in a tremendous crater. The
dust and debris also absorb much of the thermal radiation from the
fireball.

Since much of the energy is used making the crater, the shock wave is
weaker than for an airburst of the same size. Most of the dust and
particles that are thrown out of the crater become radioactive. As a
result, the groundburst is the dirtiest type in terms of radioactive fallout
and residual radiation.

Due to the shielding of the thermal radiation and the loss of energy in

cratering, the safe escape distance required for the groundburst is less
than for an airburst of equal size.

D-9 AGW-5


Text from AGW-5_Nuclear_Weapons_Introduction_page_16.jpeg:
Weapon Yield

All effects of detonation (blast, thermal radiation and nuclear initial and
residual radiation) increase with an increase in weapon yield; therefore,
larger yield weapons require greater escape distances.

The factors that govern the escape distance change as the yield increases.
The factors are controlled by a principle called the scaling laws.

The first states that the intensity of the shock wave varies as the cube
root of the increase in the yield. In other words, to triple the intensity of
the shock wave or overpressure at a specific distance from the detonation,
the yield must be increased 27 times.

Thermal radiation increases much more rapidly. According to the scaling
laws, thermal radiation increases as the square root of the increase in the
yield. In other words, to triple the intensity of the thermal radiation at a
specific distance from the detonation, the yield need only be increased
nine times.

This means the safe escape distance for the large yield weapons is
governed by the thermal radiation limits rather than the shock wave or
nuclear radiation limits. However, for the smaller yield weapons
(approximately 20 kiloton and below) the safe escape distance is governed
by the nuclear radiation limits to the aircrew rather than the two previous
considerations.

AGW-5 D-10


Text from AGW-5_Nuclear_Weapons_Introduction_page_17.jpeg:
Aircrew/Aircraft Safe Escape
The safe escape distance required is based on being beyond the aircrew
safe limits to acceptable amounts of thermal and nuclear radiation, and

the aircraft structural/blast and thermal limits at detonation.

Target Conditions

In simplified terms, we can say that thermal radiation is reflected by ice,
water, snow, and high clouds. It is attenuated by haze, fog, or dust in the
air.

Therefore, the best target conditions for aircrew escape are a rough dirt
surface, no clouds, but high humidity and low visibility.

The worst condition for safe escape is a snow or ice covered surface with
low humidity and high cloud cover.

All escape distance charts are computed for worst possible conditions.

“No Damage Criteria”

The Air Force policy specifies a “no damage criteria” for nuclear delivery
aircrew/aircraft. If the escape maneuver is flown as outlined in the
delivery handbook, following proper delivery computations and escape
techniques, you will be safe.

In addition to the normal BRU-47/A parts, each BRU-47/A contains a
reversible in-flight lockout (RIFL) mechanism which is a safety and
failsafe provision for nuclear weapons. It is a spring-loaded mechanism
that safes the BRU-47/A until a 28 volts DC control signal from the
aircraft unlocks the RIFL. When the RIFL is locked the RIFL locked
visual indicator (a white tab) appears vertically in the RIFL window and
the marker on the allen set screw is to the right, similar to the hook locked
indicators (Figure D-10, left).

The ground safety mechanism is a safety lock actuated by a ground safety
handle which places a mechanical stop on the hook linkage and opens the
electrical circuits preventing power from reaching the cartridges. The
ground safety handle must be moved to the armed position before flight.
Arm and safe are labeled at the correct handle positions on the BRU
(Figure D-10, right).

To operate the weapons system, the aircrew must perform a series of
deliberate actions in the proper sequence. These actions come from
cockpit switch and MPD/MPCD button action through the CC to the PACS
and then to the weapon. These procedures are covered in a CBT lesson.

A reporting flag word identifying a nuclear weapon safety deficiency. This
includes mishaps not falling into the accident or incident categories, but
meeting any of the following criteria:

Minor damage to a nuclear weapon or nuclear component
requiring rework, replacement, or examination or recertification
by the design agency.

Minor damage to a nuclear weapon or nuclear component
affecting nuclear surety but not requiring return of the weapon
or component to the design agency. In general, report minor
damage to electrical components, mechanically activated
components, explosives, or radioactive materials and any
damage which could cause the nuclear weapon or nuclear
component to fail or malfunction; do not report minor structural
damage not affecting nuclear surety.

Exposure of a nuclear weapon or nuclear warhead to abnormal,
severe, or unusual environments outside the normal
stockpile-to-target sequence (e.g., flood, earthquake, or
lightning).

Structural failure of DOE handling equipment.

The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program ensures personnel design
and operate nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems to satisfy the
safety standards in Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 3150.2, Safety
Studies and Reviews of Nuclear Weapon Systems, February 8, 1984. The
DOD safety standards are:

e There shall be positive measures to prevent nuclear weapons
involved in accidents or incidents, or jettisoned weapons, from
producing a nuclear yield.

e There shall be positive measures to prevent DELIBERATE
prearming, arming, launching, firing, or releasing of nuclear
weapons, except upon execution of emergency war orders or
when directed by competent authority.

e There shall be positive measures to prevent INADVERTENT
prearming, arming, launching, firing, or releasing of nuclear
weapons in all normal and credible abnormal environments.

e There shall be positive measures to ensure adequate security of

nuclear weapons, pursuant to DOD Directive 5210.41, Security
Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons, September 238, 1988.

Two-man concept comprises:

e Two knowledgeable people that are required to agree on all
nuclear actions.

e Procedures which minimize the opportunity for incorrect or
unauthorized nuclear weapons procedures.

A no-lone zone is an extension of the basic two-man concept to require two
knowledgeable individuals to be present whenever access is gained to
nuclear weapons or critical aircraft components.

Safing and sealing provides a positive means of keeping arming and
releasing controls in a safe condition (safety wire) and a means of
detecting covert activation of these controls (coded lead seals on the safety
wire). This guards against both inadvertent activation and deliberate
activation.

Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program (PRP)

AFI 36-2104 establishes the program for screening, selection and
continuous evaluation of personnel who have control, have access to, or
control access to nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon systems, or nuclear
devices. Once cleared, personnel are continuously monitored for
reliability.

It may be the commander’s responsibility to ensure that all in his
command are familiar with and comply with nuclear safety rules, but the
aircrews who ultimately put the bombs on the targets absolutely must
know the rules and the system and ensure exact compliance and
operations.

In the history of the United States, there has never been an accidental
nuclear detonation.

WEAPONS EFFECTS
Basic Weapons Effects
The basic weapons effects from all nuclear detonations can be broken

down into blast and shock, thermal radiation, and nuclear radiation
(initial and residual) (Figure D-2).

DESTRUCTION - 50 MT BOMB

TOTAL DESTRUCTION - 3.2 MILE RADIUS
LOSS OF LIFE - 20 MILE RADIUS

AGW-5 D-2


Text from AGW-5_Nuclear_Weapons_Introduction_page_9.jpeg:
Blast and Shock

Approximately fifty percent of the energy released in a nuclear detonation
is released in the form of a shock wave or blast wave. The wave resembles
a sonic boom but is much more intense. It is characterized by a very
large, rapid increase in the atmospheric pressure (“overpressure”). This is
followed by a less rapid decrease in overpressure which leads to an
underpressure before recovering to ambient pressure (Figure D-3).

The intensity of the wave varies with the strength of the detonation. The

rate of dissipation of the wave depends upon the surrounding atmospheric
conditions and the height of the burst.

NUCLEAR WEAPON LOADING

This section shows the many nuclear PACS display formats and explains
their pertinent legends.

For this example, assume you have a B61-4 on the left CFT and a B61-3
on the right CFT. There is no way to tell what is loaded by looking at the
initial display (Figure D-3).

NUC Weapon Load

To bring up the NUC WEAPON LOAD display, press PB #9 on the top
level armament display. This display shows the loaded stations across the
top. It also contains the compatible weapon legends as options for
identifying exactly which B-61 model is actually loaded. (Nuclear
weapons will self-identify on the PACS but may not be the correct model.)

Weapon Options

Once you have loaded the weapon by first boxing the appropriate legend
(in this case, B61-3, PB #8) and then pressing the proper station button
(#17 for the right CFT), the display looks like Figure D-4.

STA RC is displayed below the options indicating that the weapon on the
right CFT is selected for options programming. The selectable options for
the weapon are displayed adjacent to PBs #6-10 and PB #12. The options
shown are the default options and are selected in numerical PB order.
Repeated depressions of these push buttons step through the available
options. Loading of the weapon is complete when the options adjacent to
the option push buttons match those you wish to select. (A table of
options for each bomb is contained in TO 1F-15E-25-1.)

You can then exit to the menu or load other weapons.

PROGRAMMING

Pressing the A/G button on the ARMT menu brings up a display like
Figure D-6, left. Selecting a station places that station in priority. The
priority station is shown at the bottom of the display above PB #8, along
with its program options (Figure D-6, right). If more than one station is
selected, the priority station is the first in the sequence LC, RC, L, R, C.
To review or modify the program for the stations not in priority, it is
necessary to deselect the higher priority stations. This brings the desired
station into priority and displays its programming options. If no nuclear
station is selected, no program options are displayed.

Selectable options which pertain to the weapon in priority (as shown at
the bottom of the display over PB #8) are displayed above PBs #6-9. To
change an option, press the button below it, then follow the same
procedures used during the loading option selection. Some restrictions
may apply based on delivery option or selections made during loading.
Notice that function and chute delay are no longer selectable. To display
the selectable option for the other loaded bombs, deselect the higher
priority stations.

The display initializes with LIST boxed at PB #4. With LIST boxed,
options are shown below each loaded station for up to three weapons
(Figure D-7, left). The options shown are for the priority station plus the
next two loaded stations in priority sequence (be sure to check PB #8 to
ensure you are changing the desired weapon).

You may retain the options for each bomb or you can declutter the display
by unboxing LIST, which returns to the format of Figure D-7, right and
stores the options in the CC and PACS memory. Note that with LIST
unboxed, the A/G delivery page data is displayed.

ARMING

Nuclear bomb arming requires three steps: PAL enabling, placing the
nuclear consent switches in both cockpits to ARM, and satisfying a unique
signal generator (USG) code. In addition, unlocking the rack is required
prior to release. B61-0 through B61-2 weapons do not have a unique
signal generator; B61-3 and later weapons do have one.

Both nuclear consent switches must be placed to ARM to gain access to
the ARM mode. Placing both switches to ARM results in the removal of
the NUCLEAR CONSENT REQ’D TO ARM advisory and display of SEL
USG or ARM at PB #12, depending on what bomb type is being armed
(Figure D-13). If the bomb being armed does not have a USG, ARM is
displayed at PB #12 at this point and the next step of selecting the USG
code is bypassed.

at PB #12 changes to ARM (Figure D-14). Duplicate the USG numbers
exactly, just like you did for the PAL code.

The number 17283 tells the bomb it is being armed by an F-15E. This
provides a coded voltage to preclude stray voltage affecting the arming
process. It is not a security code (like PAL) and is printed in the nuclear

checklist.

WEAPON RELEASE
Unlocking

After the A/G master mode is selected and the nuclear consent switches
are both out of the SAFE position, the UNLK CONT legend appears
adjacent to PB #1. To begin the final release sequence select UNLK
CONT. This electrically unlocks the BRU-47/A for the weapon in priority,
boxes UNLK CONT and changes the priority weapon’s status to UNLK
(Figure D-22).

As you recall, the priority release sequence for nuclear weapons is LC, RC,
L, R, and C. The desired weapon can be placed in priority by unboxing
higher priority stations until the desired station is in priority. The
priority station can be confirmed by boxing LIST and checking PB #8.

Alternate Release

If all prerequisites for release have been met but the bomb does not come
off using either pickle button, rotating the armament control knob to
ALTN REL makes the JETT button a third pickle button for releasing
armed weapons (Figure D-25). Note, however, that this is a “hot” pickle
button and the bomb will bypass any computed release and drop
immediately.

Emergency Release

As previously mentioned, the panic button can be used to release armed
nuclear weapons if all release prerequisites have been met. This method
applies only to bombs on the LC and RC stations. All conventional carted
pylons and/or stores will also be released, such as external fuel tanks.

SELECTIVE JETTISON

The PACS selective jettison mode permits jettisoning any or all nuclear
stores. It includes a positive safing feature where all power is removed
from the weapon interface before jettison. Only the pilot can perform the
jettison function. However, IAW the two-man concept, both crew
members must actuate their nuclear consent switch from the safe and
sealed position to JETTISON ENABLE or ARM. This allows the bomb
racks to be unlocked.

Initiation

The pilot selects A/G SEL JETT on the armament control panel. This
removes all MON/SAFE/ARM power from the weapon interface, locks all
bomb racks, deselects all weapon stations, and brings up the A/G
JETTISON display on the FCP MPCD and all PACS displays

(Figure D-27). However, selections can only be made by the pilot on the
FCP MPCD.

Next, nuclear consent must be given in both cockpits.

The pilot selects the station(s) to be jettisoned on the FCP MPCD. This
applies power; weapon and rack status are shown on a display similar to
Figure D-28, left. If bombs are armed, the crew boxes SAFE and a
strikeout appears through nonselected bombs. OFF reappears after ten
seconds. Once the weapon(s) is taken to OFF, UNLK CONT is displayed
after three seconds (Figure D-28, right). Nonselected stations will
continue to show status even though OFF is boxed.

Safing

The selective jettison mode includes a positive safing feature which
prevents jettison when the weapon’s internal mechanism is not SAFE
until safing has been attempted. If a selected weapon does not indicate
SAFE, a display like Figure D-30 results. SAFE at PB #13 and SAFE
STATUS UNSAT caution appears above PB #8 when A/G SEL JETT is
selected. Further discussion of nuclear cautions are later in this
workbook.

You must box SAFE to apply safing power to the weapon. The display
changes to the safe weapon format previously seen (Figure D-28, left) once
the weapon reports SAFE to the PACS. The MON and OFF will appear
10 seconds after selecting SAFE. Then turn the weapon off and unlock
the rack, and the SEL JETT button becomes “hot.”

TRAINING

The PACS has a feature that allows you to practice nuclear procedures
with or without training stores loaded on the aircraft. For both modes any
PAL code will work as long as the number of digits is correct.

Without Training Stores

To practice nuclear procedures without releasing practice weapons, box
A/G TRNG on the ARMT menu and then select NUC LOAD or you can go
to the NUC LOAD page first and then box TRNG at PB #15. Next,
program the simulated load in the same manner as previously described
for real weapons. Procedures for monitoring, enabling, arming, and
releasing are identical to the real ones. Note that NUCLEAR TRAINING
is always present on the PACS display (Figure D-33).

With Training Stores

You can also practice nuclear procedures using training ordnance instead
of the real bombs. The training weapons you can program are BDU-38s
and MK-106/BDU-338s carried in a SUU-20.

Loading

The first step is to load the real weapon types and options that you want
to simulate into the PACS. You use the procedures for real bombs; do not
box TRNG. After the options are set you must unbox all the stations at
the top of the display before the display looks like Figure D-35. Then
press PB #7 to bring up the NUC TRAINING STORES LOAD format
shown in Figure D-386.

other than the ones you want to drop as simulated NUCs. Other practice
bombs in the SUU-20 can be dropped from the conventional PACS.
Repeat for other practice bombs. Note: MK-106 is no longer available in
the Air Force inventory. For retarded deliveries a BDU-38 must be used.
TREL, TPULL, and TBURST shown for a BDU-38 will be significantly

Dry Run/Tone

Two other training-only options are available when you move the master
arm to ARM in the delivery sequence; they are TONE and DRY RUN
(Figure D-39).

Boxing TONE causes a tone to be produced from UHF #1 when either
pickle button is held depressed; it stops when the PACS receives the CC
release signal. It can be used for radar bomb scoring (RBS) or with
weapons release.

DRY RUN inhibits actual weapon release but causes the display to react
as if release had occurred. The priority weapon legends drop off but can
be reinstated by unboxing DRY RUN. This feature lets you make a
practice run before actual release.

The F-15E caution system alerts you to abnormal conditions involving
loaded nuclear weapons. During operations the PACS continuously
monitors the nuclear loaded stations and, if a caution situation occurs, it
immediately notifies you via the MASTER CAUTION and NUCLEAR
CAUTION lights in each cockpit. The caution is also written on the PACS
display. If more than one caution occurs, the one of highest priority is
shown. Ifa similar condition is present at more than one station, then the
caution for the station which has highest priority for release is displayed.

GENERAL

The PACS display on a MPD/MPCD is the primary means of controlling
and monitoring nuclear weapons in the F-15E. It can be called up and
operated from either cockpit which gives great flexibility. Some
traditional switches are still used, such as the nuclear consent switches
for two-man control.

The objective of the following information is to explain the meaning of the
numerous nuclear display formats and symbology. To do this, you will be
taken through a typical sequence of events for a nuclear operation. The
“how to” aspect is the primary thrust in the CBT lesson.

A typical mission configuration might be as depicted in Figure D-1 with
three external fuel tanks and two nuclear weapons on the CFT stations.
This is the load you will see on subsequent nuclear PACS displays in this
lesson.

Text from AGW-6_Nuclear_PACS_page_8.jpeg:
SWITCHES

The switches required for nuclear weapons operations that are not
integrated into the PACS display are detailed below and shown in
Figure D-2.

Master Mode Select

To deliver any air-to-surface weapon you must select the A/G master
mode. Changing to other master modes locks the racks.

Emergency Jettison Select Switch

The “panic” button releases the priority weapon on a CFT station if the
rack has been unlocked. The weapon may be jettisoned armed. Any
conventional weapons that are carted on any station will also be
jettisoned.

Armament Control Panel

ALTN REL - provides an alternate means to release a nuclear weapon
which is armed, unlocked, and otherwise ready.

A/G SEL JETT - allows selective jettison of nuclear weapons in a safe
condition.

MAN FF, MAN RET - these modes are inhibited with nuclear weapons on
board and will cause all stations to deselect, lock, and remove power from
the bomb interface. The pilot must exit manual settings and restart the
entire nuclear arming sequence.

COMBAT - provides a preprogrammed combat jettison mode for the fuel
tanks if they are on board. The first push jettisons the centerline tank.
The second push jettisons the wing tanks.

JETT BUTTON - initiates the selected mode.

MASTER ARM - provides power to deliver a weapon.

AGW-6 D-2


Text from AGW-6_Nuclear_PACS_page_9.jpeg:
Nuclear Consent Switches

These guarded switches, one in each cockpit, have three positions:

SAFE - either switch in SAFE deenergizes arming and release
circuitry. Allows the guard to be closed for safety wiring.

ARM - both switches in ARM energizes arming and release circuitry.
JETTISON ENABLE - deenergizes arming and energizes release
circuitry, and provides rack unlock consent to the PACS. All weapons
must be released in a SAFE condition. Enabling combinations:

Failure Indications

If the radar altimeter is in OFF or OVERRIDE, experiences a failure, or
radar altimeter altitude/bank/pitch limits are exceeded, the digital
readouts display OFF if selected for display (UFC Data 1). If the altitude
thermometer was present, it disappears. If radar altitude was not
selected for display, there will be no indication of failure on the HUD.

A word of caution: OFF may not display immediately after exceeding
attitude limits. It may still change or freeze to a set altitude for some
time in rapidly changing attitudes before changing to OFF. Rely on the
RALT reading only when within parameter limits and a stable attitude.

AUTOPILOT

The autopilot, through the automatic flight control system, can
automatically maintain a desired attitude, altitude, heading, and/or
course. The modes and submodes are engaged and monitored through the
up-front control (UFC) and may be overridden and/or disengaged at any
time.

Modes and Submodes

Autopilot Disengagement

The autopilot (including submodes) is disengaged by pressing the paddle
switch on either cockpit control stick or by exceeding basic autopilot
limits. Submodes are disengaged by deselecting them on the UFC
autopilot submenu or by exceeding individual submode limits.

Attitude/Heading Hold

These are the basic autopilot modes. When engaged, it maintains the
current pitch attitude and if the current bank angle is greater than 7°, it
maintains that bank angle. It is referred to as attitude (ATT) hold. Ifthe
bank angle is equal to or less than 7°, it maintains current pitch attitude
and wings level. This is referred to as heading (HDG) hold. For basic
autopilot engagement, the aircraft must be within +45° of pitch, 60° of
bank, +25°/second roll rate, or within -1 to +3 incremental Gs. If outside
these parameters, the autopilot does not engage, and if engaged, it
disengages. Also, if any CAS axis disengages, either paddle switch is
depressed, or the INS attitude is invalid, the autopilot will not engage or
will disengage.

AVI-10 D-10


Text from AVI-10_Radar_Altimeter__Autopilot_page_17.jpeg:
Altitude Hold/Select

In the altitude hold (ALT HOLD) submode, the autopilot keeps the
aircraft at a specified altitude. In the altitude select (ALT SELECT)
submode, the autopilot flies the aircraft to an aircrew entered altitude at a
climb/descent rate controlled by the aircrew’s throttle inputs. In either
submode the altitude reference may be barometric (BARO) or radar
(RDR), as selected by the crew. ALT HOLD or ALT SELECT can be
engaged/disengaged simultaneously with basic autopilot engagement, or
separately added to/deleted from basic autopilot. The altitude submodes
will not operate separately from (i.e., without) the basic autopilot. Either
submode can be disengaged along with the basic autopilot by the paddle
switch, by exceeding parameters, or individually by deselecting the
submode on the UFC autopilot submenu.

BARO With BARO selected, the aircraft flies the barometric

HOLD altitude at engagement as measured by the air data
computer. If control stick steering is used, it
references the new altitude when the stick is released.

RDR Radar altitude hold maintains the existing altitude at

HOLD engagement as long as it is between 380 and 50,000
feet. The radar altitude hold mode is not
recommended for use over rolling/rugged terrain below
5000 feet above ground level (AGL).

BARO SEL/ The crew can select a barometric or radar altitude

RDR SEL by using the autopilot submenu of the UFC. Both
altitude select modes use a constant airspeed/mach
profile to climb to the selected altitude and a constant
airspeed profile to descend. The autopilot reverts to
the altitude hold submode when the selected altitude
is reached. The desired climb or descent airspeed
should be achieved prior to engaging the ALT SELECT
submode. The crew then initiates and controls the
climb or descent with the throttles. Airspeed may be
adjusted using control stick steering during the climb
or descent. Consult TO 1F-15E-1, Section 1 for system
operating limits.

D-11 AVI-10


Text from AVI-10_Radar_Altimeter__Autopilot_page_18.jpeg:
BLENDED _ Blended mode allows the aircrew to add terrain

MODE following protection to the autopilot altitude hold
mode. Blended mode maintains the current baro or
radar altitude until the auto terrain following (ATF)
system determines that positive Gs are required to
maintain the TF set clearance plane. Once the terrain
has been cleared, the aircraft automatically recaptures
the previous baro or radar altitude. The blended mode
is not operational in manual terrain following.

Automatic Terrain Following (ATF)

The autopilot can also be coupled to the terrain following system to
provide automatic, low altitude, terrain following flight. This system can
be used with all autopilot submodes.

Steer Modes

The autopilot can also be coupled with one of five azimuth steering
submodes to automatically fly a desired course. The options, heading
(HDG), navigation (NAV), TACAN (TCN)/course (CRS), or ground track
(GT), are selected on the HSI and engaged through the UFC. They are
compatible with the altitude hold submodes, with auto TFR, and function
in all master modes but air-to-air. Disengagement is done through the
paddle switch or the UFC by deselecting STR MODE.

HDG maintains the selected command heading on the HSI.

NAV maintains a great circle course from present position to the
current aircraft sequence point.

TCN steers to a 45° course intercept, and then maintains the
TACAN course set on the HSI.

CRS uses TACAN steering equations to intercept a selected
course to the current NAV steerpoint. CRS alternates with
TCN on the HSI.

AVI-10 D-12


Text from AVI-10_Radar_Altimeter__Autopilot_page_19.jpeg:
GT holds the ground track heading at engagement. A specific
GT cannot be selected on the HSI with autopilot steer mode
engaged. To change GT, you must use control stick
steering.

Three steer modes, ALG, ILST, and ILSN, cannot be coupled to the
autopilot.

Control Stick Steering (CSS)

Control stick steering during autopilot operation means manually moving
the stick in pitch and/or roll without disengaging the autopilot. This
allows the aircraft to be maneuvered without reengaging the autopilot
every time. Stick force required varies from 1 to 3 lbs; once the stick force
is relieved, the autopilot resumes normal operation. No lights come on to
indicate CSS; however, should an autopilot mode or submode disengage
during CSS due to excessive force, the AUTO PLT caution is triggered.

CSS in roll will begin a turn and when pressure is removed, will reacquire
the selected HSI steering except for GT steering. In the GT steering
mode, if CSS is engaged, the bank angle must be manually reduced to less
than 7° to capture a new ground track. If the bank angle is greater than
or equal to 7° the autopilot will enter roll attitude hold until the bank
angle is reduced to less than 7°.

Pitch control stick steering while in ALT HOLD mode resets the altitude
reference to be held when CSS is terminated. Pitch control stick steering
during “altitude select” only resets the airspeed/mach reference to be held
while climbing or descending to the selected altitude.

Figure D - 11. Autopilot Submenu.

For the ALT HOLD mode to be displayed, SEL OFF must be displayed at
PB #8. If an altitude is displayed at PB #8 (Figure D-12, page D-19)
PB #8 will display ALT SELECT.

The altitude to be held may be adjusted with pitch CSS by applying pitch
pressure to the control stick without disengaging the autopilot.

D-19 AVI-10


Text from AVI-10_Radar_Altimeter__Autopilot_page_26.jpeg:
Altitude Select

There must first be an altitude displayed at PB #8 on the UFC for ALT
SELECT to be displayed at PB #3 (Figure D-12). If the scratchpad is
blank, pressing PB #8 momentarily toggles between SEL OFF and the
last valid altitude entry. At central computer power up, PB #8 defaults to
SEL OFF and the toggled default altitude is 31,000 feet. Enter the
desired altitude value into the scratchpad and press PB #8. Entries
between 10 and 500 transfer to PB #8 as values between 1000 and 50,000;
entries between 1000 and 50,000 transfer as entered. Once an altitude is
displayed at PB #8, ALT SELECT is displayed at PB #3 and the mode is
available for selection.

The altitude reference may be either RDR or BARO, as selected and
displayed at PB #4. Although you would normally select the altitude
reference prior to engaging the ALT SELECT mode, you can toggle
between RDR and BARO with ALT SELECT engaged. When switching
from RDR to BARO, the selected altitude is compared to ground level. If
the selected altitude is at least 1000 feet above ground level, the reference
switches to BARO. Ifthe selected altitude is less than 1000 feet above
ground level, PB #4 displays BARO momentarily then changes back to
RDR, and RDR remains the altitude reference. However, there is no
interlock when initially in BARO to prevent selecting a BARO ALT
SELECT that is below ground level.

To engage the submode, the aircrew first establishes the desired
climb/descent airspeed, then presses PB #3. Submode initiation results in
capture of the current calibrated airspeed and/or mach which is displayed
at PB #7. Airspeed/Mach or airspeed is only displayed at PB #7 when the
submode is actually engaged, as in Figure D-12. As the throttles are
moved, the aircraft descends at a constant calibrated airspeed or climbs at
a constant calibrated airspeed, until reaching a transition mach which it
then maintains until level off. The aircrew controls rate of climb or
descent with throttle movement.

Use CSS to change the calibrated airspeed in the climb or descent by
applying pitch pressure to the stick until the new airspeed is obtained.

AVI-10 D - 20


Text from AVI-10_Radar_Altimeter__Autopilot_page_27.jpeg:
The aircrew can deselect the ALT SELECT submode in three ways.
Pressing PB #8 toggles to SEL OFF and the autopilot reverts to altitude
hold at the current altitude. Pressing PB #8 deselects the ALT SELECT
submode and the autopilot reverts to attitude/heading hold. Depressing
either cockpit paddle switch disengages the autopilot completely (basic
autopilot and all submodes).

Steer Modes

To couple a steer mode with the autopilot, the desired mode must be
selected on the HSI display (Figure D-14, left). Whichever steer mode is
boxed (except ILST, ILSN, or ALG) is the one coupled. If ILST or ILSN is
boxed on the HSI at A/P engagement, INV is shown on the UFC at PB #2
and the steer mode cannot be selected. If ALG is boxed at autopilot
engagement, the steer mode changes to NAV on the HSI. With the
autopilot engaged in ALG or ILS steering, selections are removed from the
HSI since they are not autopilot compatible (Figure D-14, left). The boxed
steer mode also appears on the autopilot submenu at PB #2 (Figure D-14,
right). By pressing PB #2, the steer mode is preselected or engaged; an
asterisk shows the status. “A / P” appears on the HSI (Figure D-14, left)
when a steer mode is engaged, and the steer mode also appears on UFC
Menu 1 and the top line of the autopilot submenu when engaged.

The steer mode cannot be selected in the air-to-air master mode. PB #2 on
the UFC autopilot submenu will be blanked in the air-to-air master mode.

RADAR ALTIMETER & AUTOPILOT

INTRODUCTION

This workbook is your guide in studying the radar altimeter and the
autopilot. These two seemingly unrelated systems have been combined in
a CBT lesson which gives “hands-on” experience. The autopilot uses the
radar altimeter in some of its submodes. As part of a computer-based
training (CBT) lesson, this workbook should be read prior to taking the
CBT instruction.

With a steer mode engaged, the autopilot status is displayed as “A/P
AHDG, A/P NAV, A/P TCN, A/P CRS, or A/P GT” (Figure D-15, left). If
both an altitude function and a steer mode are engaged, the status is
displayed with the steer mode first; i.e., AYP NAV/ALT as in Figure D-15,
right. The Menu 1 autopilot status and the autopilot submenu status will
always be identical.

Note: To distinguish between the heading hold (wings level) basic
autopilot mode and the autopilot heading hold steer mode (as selected on

the HSD, the autopilot status line will show AHDG for the steer mode and
HDG for wings level basic autopilot.

Submode Preselection

Altitude and steering submodes can be preselected on the autopilot
submenu by pressing the button beside the desired submode with the
autopilot disengaged. Then, when the A/P button on the UFC is pressed,
they become engaged. It is not necessary to first select basic autopilot and
then add submodes. Failing to check the autopilot submenu prior to
engagement could give an unexpected response.

HUD

The engaged steer mode is also shown on the HUD by the letter “A” in
front of the steering mode in the data block (Figure D-16).

Autopilot Light

A green “A/P” advisory light in both cockpits indicates that an autopilot
mode is engaged. However, when the auto terrain following (ATF) radar
is in control of the aircraft, the “A/P” advisory lights illuminate only when
a steer mode is engaged. In other words, the “A/P” advisory lights only
come on when an aircrew selects an autopilot function on the UFC, not
when the ATF uses the autopilot.

Autopilot Cautions

The AUTO PLT caution will be displayed on the appropriate MPD/MPCD
(Figure D-17) as a display caution. When it appears, it also illuminates
the FLT CONTR major category light and the MASTER CAUTION light.
These cautions are activated by an unsuccessful autopilot engagement
attempt (including submodes), by a malfunction-caused disengagement, or
exceeding CSS limits (including submode limits). To clear the AUTO PLT
caution and extinguish the FLT CONTR and MASTER CAUTION lights,
press the FCP MASTER CAUTION.

AVI-10-17

Figure D - 17. Autopilot Caution.
Autopilot Status Feedback

The autopilot caution indication logic is such that the “AUTO PLT”
display caution, “FLT CONTR” caution on the caution lights panel
(forward and AFT), and MASTER CAUTION are only displayed for
autopilot system failures disengagement via exceedance of limits. The
autopilot caution indications are not provided for aircrew initiated
autopilot disengagements (paddle switch or submode deselection).

If the autopilot is failing and the reason is unknown, go to the DETAIL,
AFCS, STATUS page. The top portion shows up to seven failures (last on
top of list) of the autopilot and/or TF system.

RADAR ALTIMETER
Description and Function

The radar altimeter system is composed of the antenna, the receiver/
transmitter (R/T), and associated cables and hardware. It sends out a
low-powered radar beam directly below the aircraft which accurately
measures height above ground level (AGL) altitude. The signal is divided
and sent to each AIU where it is tested for validity and currency. Then,
the central computer takes the valid output from either AIU for display
and use by other systems. The readout of radar altitude can be presented
on several cockpit displays (UFC, ADI, HUD, and TF E-scope). The
information is also used by the autopilot in the radar altitude hold or
select submodes, by the low altitude warning system (LAWS), by the
terrain following (TF) system, and by the ground collision warning system
(GCWS). The radar altimeter is sometimes referred to as the combined
altitude radar altimeter (CARA) or RALT (radar altimeter).

Parameters

The operating limits for the radar altimeter are as follows:
e Altitude - 50,000 feet to ground level
e Pitch attitude - +60°
e 6Bank angle - 60°

Should these limits be exceeded, the cockpit digital readouts change to
OFF.

Radar Altimeter Switch

With the switch in the OFF position, the unit is turned off (Figure D-1); in
the ON position it is turned on for normal operation. The OVERRIDE
position turns the unit off, but allows manual TF to be accomplished.

Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_16.jpeg:
Even if the test on a particular system/component takes only milliseconds,
the system in test must appear in the in-test window for at least 2 seconds
for the BIT to be accomplished. If the component in test just flashes, and
the BIT menu returns or continues to the next component in test, a BIT was
not accomplished on that system.

Initiating BIT places STOP at PB #19. Selecting STOP (PB #19) on an
in-test submenu terminates the BIT and returns the display to the BIT
menu (Figure D-7). Pressing STOP

e does not stop the radar BIT (use auto acq switch/reject)

e does not stop the ICSCP/RICP BIT (voice warning continues to
completion) or RALT (radar altimeter, only lasts a few seconds)

If a system BIT takes an excessive amount of time to complete, you may
attempt to terminate the BIT by pressing STOP. If the system in test
remains in BIT for another 5 seconds after STOP is pressed, ESCAPE
replaces the STOP legend. Pressing ESCAPE is designed to reset the BIT
routine in the CC and return the display to the BIT menu. However,
system lock up may occur when ESCAPE is pressed, and the BIT system as
well as the component that is hung may be unavailable for the remainder of
the mission.

AVI-11 D-10


Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_17.jpeg:
On the ground, the BIT menu displays all the systems that have an
initiated BIT capability. An in-flight BIT is not allowed on the
multipurpose display processor (DSPL), air data computer (ADC),
exceedence counter (the “G meter” for the OWS) (EXCS), inertial navigation
system (INS), automatic flight control system (AFCS), and embedded global
positioning system/inertial navigation system (EGI). An I-BIT causes
interruption of normal system operation and with these particular systems
flight safety could be affected (Figure D-8). They are removed from the BIT
menu.

Some systems are present conditionally. AIM displays at PB #2 on the
ground with the ASP PACS switch in OFF. PACS replaces AIM at PB #2
with the switch in ON. SFDR (PB #16) is only displayed when the CC gets
no response from the Signal Data Recorder (before TCTO 1F-15E-651) or
Standard Flight Data Recorder (after TCTO 1F-15E-651).

The LANT/RALT selection is removed from the BIT menu in-flight during
armed manual or auto terrain following radar operations.

To accomplish a full AUTO BIT, all avionics/systems to be checked must be
turned on and timed in. Any equipment not turned on/timed in will appear
as failed in the BIT failure window.

AVI-11 D-16


Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_23.jpeg:
After starting an AUTO BIT (Figure D-11, left), the following cues indicate
AUTO BIT operation.

All MPD/MPCDs go blank for a minimum of two seconds and a maximum of
15 seconds. Then they alternately display gray scales with blank screens,
ending with gray scales and displaying “MPDP TEST PASSED” or “MPDP
TEST FAILED,” as appropriate. The total fuel reported to the OWS is also
displayed. This value should be checked against the fuel gauges. Five
seconds later, the gray scales disappear, and the test continues.

If an AUTO BIT hangs up at a particular system/component, all
systems/components downstream from the hang-up can be BIT checked by
individually selecting an initiated BIT for those items.

AIM I-BIT Operation

When the radar power knob is moved out of OFF, an AIM-120 BIT initiate
signal is applied to each station (in missile launch sequence) with a missile
aboard. Each missile is tested individually, requiring about 4 seconds per
missile.

The crew can initiate the same AIM-120 BIT routine from the BIT display.
AIM is displayed on the BIT menu adjacent to PB #2 (Figure D-14), unless
the PACS consent switch is ON, in which case PACS appears at PB #2.
Pressing AIM (PB #2) initiates the AIM I-BIT for all AIM-120s in sequence.

PACS I-BIT

The PACS I-BIT is strictly a maintenance function. PACS only appears as
an option at PB #2 when the PACS consent switch on the avionics status
panel is in the ON position. This switch must be electronically held in the
ON position. Once ground power is removed, the switch automatically
returns to the OFF (or “AIM”) position.

In the unlikely situation that PACS is displayed by PB #2 after engine
start, have the ground crew check the PACS consent switch (Figure D-15).

WARNING

You must shut down one engine before the
crew chief can enter the nose wheelwell.

The PACS I-BIT concludes with firing voltages being sent to all weapons
stations. Therefore, we stress again, the PACS I-BIT is strictly a
maintenance function.

Remote Map Reader I-BIT

Prior to TCTO 1F-15E-700, an RMR I-BIT is accomplished by pressing RMR
(PB #6) on the BIT2 menu (Figure D-16) which calls up the RMR test
submenu and starts the RMR BIT. The TSD map blanks and several
seconds later the display automatically adjusts the color, followed by the
display of the TSD/RMR (Figure D-16). Total time required to run an RMR
I-BIT is approximately 20-25 seconds. Pressing STOP on the BIT display is
required to get back to the normal TSD display and to return the BIT
display to the BIT menu format. This discussion assumes you have the
TSD up, as well as the BIT display, on the MPD/MPCD.

AFCS I-BIT

Prior to starting an AFCS I-BIT ensure that:

Weight is on wheels

Landing gear handle is down

Engine RPM is less than 80%

Holding brake is set

Pitch and roll ratio switches are in AUTO

ANTISKID is NORM

The AFCS I-BIT takes approximately 1 minute and 40 seconds to complete.
To prevent an aborted or failed AFCS BIT, do not operate AFCS
switches/controls (flaps, speedbrake, etc.), do not rest your hands on the
stick, or feet on the rudder pedals during the BIT.

AVI-11


Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_31.jpeg:
An AFCS I-BIT is accomplished by pressing and holding the BIT (consent)
button on the CAS panel (FCP), and then pressing and releasing AFCS

(PB #9) on the BIT menu (Figure D-17). The BIT (consent) button interlock
prevents inadvertent AFCS BIT initiation since the flight controls are
automatically moved (quite violently) during an AFCS BIT. Once AFCS
BIT begins “AFCS IN TEST,” (Figure D-17, top right), the CAS panel BIT
(consent) button can be released.

INS I-BIT

An INS I-BIT will not normally be done prior to flight since it takes
approximately 15 minutes to complete the test, and a full gyrocompass
alignment must then be accomplished. If an INS BIT is accomplished,
maintenance TOs would be required to interpret the information presented.

The discussions on the next 3 pages provide information on what the
aircrew could see (and in some cases hear) as the I-BIT on various systems
are being accomplished. You will not normally observe the BIT process in
such exacting detail. Scan the discussions for general understanding only.
It is not necessary for you to memorize all these indications.

MAINTENANCE BIT

Maintenance BITs are available on the ground and in flight. Any time a
malfunction is known or suspected, a recording of a MAINT BIT may be
required prior to shutdown. If CC mux bus failures occur, the aircrew must
access the MAINT AUDIT page to clear these failures and allow full system
operation.

AFCS failures may be cleared without accessing the MAINT AUDIT page.
For the AFCS, MAINT AUDIT provides a visual check for the existence or
absence of failure codes.

MAINT Submenu

Selection of the MAINT submenu from the BIT menu (Figure D-20, left)
provides an in-depth maintenance oriented test of the systems shown on the
periphery of the MAINT submenu (Figure D-20, right). For example,
selecting PB #1 brings up a display (Figure D-20, bottom) that permits BITs
to be run on listed system components. To stop a running BIT, select
STOP, which appears at PB# 19 only while the BIT is running.

Exit the component selection page by pressing the button next to the system
being checked to return to the maintenance submenu, or the MAINT button
to return to the BIT menu. Interpretation of some MAINT data pages
requires the use of a technical order maintenance code table.

Power interruptions result in accumulated mux bus failures in the AFCS
and CC nonvolatile memory, identified by 5 A/B and 6 A/B suffixes (Figure
D-21, left). This is caused by the BIT system running continuous and
periodic BITs on equipment which the system thinks has failed. When this
occurs, the nonvolatile memory must be cleared.

AFCS mux bus failures can be cleared by holding the paddle switch

depressed, while pressing and releasing the BIT (consent) button on the

INTRODUCTION
Description/Function

The built-in test (BIT) system is a CC resident program that provides the
aircrew with the status of the avionics system components. For the BIT
system to operate, the CC and AIU 1 must be operative. Some of the BITs
are aircrew initiated from an MPD/MPCD BIT display. For these BITs,
obviously, the MPDP must be operative.

BIT Test Methods

Three different types of BIT testing methods are used.

Continuous BIT

Provides constant monitoring of the avionics system for presence, value and
logic. This method does not interfere with the normal operation of avionics
that are being tested.

Periodic BIT

Automatically inserts test signals and replies during operation which do not
interfere with normal operation of the avionic system.

Initiated BIT

Is “initiated” by the aircrew and causes interruption of normal
system/component operation during the test.

When equipment is turned on, a BIT or a portion of an initiated BIT
(40-100%) is automatically accomplished. This turn-on BIT is sometimes
referred to as an operational BIT.

BIT INDICATORS

BIT, caution and MPD/MPCD indications provide the aircrew with
continuous status of the avionics equipment.

D-1 AVI-11


Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_8.jpeg:
System Cautions

When a system/component fails a BIT, the AV BIT caution light
illuminates. Ifthe failure logic meets the aircraft caution system logic, a
MASTER CAUTION light, yellow caution light and MPD/MPCD caution
legend may also result. The AV BIT light (BIT failure) itself does not
illuminate the MASTER CAUTION light, but depressing the MASTER
CAUTION light in either cockpit does extinguish the AV BIT light. The AV
BIT light is your cue to check the BIT display for information concerning a
failed BIT.

Equipment Latch Indicators

Failure of an avionics system component to pass a BIT check causes its
indicator on the avionics status panel in the nose wheel well to latch (Figure
D-1, left).

An MPD/MPCD or HUD BIT failure causes the BIT ball on the display
itself to latch (Figure D-1, right). When preflighting the aircraft, check the
avionics status panel for failure indications and coordinate with
maintenance personnel, as required.

Text from AVI-11_Built-In_Test_BIT_page_9.jpeg:
The MPD/MPCD and HUD BIT latch indicators can be reset by turning the
unit OFF and then ON, or running a successful BIT on the component.

BIT DISPLAYS
BIT Menu

The two BIT menus are accessed from any MPD/MPCD by pressing PB #20
on display Menu 1. Once the main BIT menu is displayed, BIT menu 2
(BIT2 legend) may be accessed by pressing PB #12 on the BIT display.
Subsequently, pressing PB #12 (BIT legend) will return to the main BIT

A/A Radar,

A/G Radar,

TEWS, and

TF Can be displayed on any MPD but not on MPCDs.

The radar initially defaults to the A/A format; however, the A/G format
can be selected from the radar display. Except for the FCP MPCD, which
provides only a “hardwired” ADI, the remaining displays may be scrolled
through, as desired, to obtain the formats available on each display. The
available (scrollable) formats are listed in Figure D-2. Note that the TSD
format is not available in the FCP and no HUD repeater is available in
the rear cockpit.

The HSI is not an available display format in either cockpit. The compass
rose, TCN/NAV data blocks, and TCN/NAV bearing pointers are still
available on the TEWS display (Figure D-3) and some of the HSI functions
are transferred to the ADI format (Figure D-4). Some information (e.g.,
function of bank steering bar, display of pitch steering bar, ILS
localizer/glide slope raw data) is dependent upon what steer mode is
selected. These multimode/steer mode dependent display features are
addressed in the following section as they apply to the HUD, but
remember, such information is generally applicable to the ADI as well.
Section I of the Dash 1 contains illustrations of the ADI with the different
steer modes selected (ADI—backup mode).

The MPDP defaults the HUD to the same degraded format regardless of

However, changing steer modes does affect the HUD presentation (see the
asterisked items in Figure D-5). This information is generally depicted
just as it would be on a normal HUD with the NAV or INST master mode

CC computation/support (that is not assumed by the MPDP) is blanked on
the UFC. The MPDP initially defaults the UFC to Menu 1 (Figure D-6).
Note that the current steer point (PB #10) initially defaults to STR 0
indicating that no steer point is available for navigation. Remember, the
routes were stored in CC nonvolatile memory.

Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_14.jpeg:
The MPDP supports selection and display of the following UFC formats
(Figure D-6).

@ Menu 1 and 2
@ Point data lat/long submenu (from Menu 1, PB #10)
@ PP keeping source submenu (from Menu 2, PB #4)

e INS is the only PP source available for navigation. If MN
or EGI was selected prior to CC failure, the PP source
defaults to INS automatically at CC failure.

Additionally, with CC failure the MPDP/AIUs continue to support and
allow display of the following UFC formats/information.

@ UHF 1 and 2 (row 5 & 6) including UHF 1 and 2 submenus
(including the KY-58 submenu)

@ TACAN including TACAN submenu but excluding TACAN
program submenu

@ = IFF/AAT including submenus but excluding the IFF phasing
submenu and the EID submenu

Data 1 and 2 formats are not available. If an unavailable UFC format is
requested, the UFC display will not change.

The MPDP supports the capability for only two steer points. The HUD,
ADI, and TEWS NAV data blocks initialize as NAV INV (HUD) or STR
NONE (ADI/TEWS) while the UFC (Menu 1) initializes to STR 0. To
enter data for the two steer points, call up the UFC point data submenu
and enter (STR) 1 and/or (STR) 2 and their respective lat/long coordinates.
No syntax other than 1 or 2 will be accepted. These points can be
successively changed as the aircraft progresses along a flight route
(leapfrog). Only manual sequencing is available. Current NAV steering
(NAV data blocks on the HUD/ADI/TEWS, the bank steering bars in the
HUD/ADI and the bearing pointer on the TEWS) reflect the current steer
point showing at Menu 1, PB #10 (again either STR 1 or STR 2).
Command (CMD) heading is not available on the HUD or ADI.

TSD/RMR

With CC failure the TSD format loses cursor related functions because
TGT IR and radar patch maps are not functional capabilities with CC
failure. Therefore, the sensors cannot be cued from the TSD.
Additionally, the look ahead function is inoperative and most of the
pushbutton options normally available are unavailable with CC failure
(Figure D-7).

The TSD continues to provide all primary status cues; i.e., “MAP NOT

provides selectable parameters for MAP scale; i.e., TSD range. Note in
Figure D-6 (Menu 2) that the UFC UPDT MENU format (OVERFLY,
HUD, ALTITUDE, TACAN) is not one of the available UFC formats.
However, with CC failure, the INS can be updated by defining the point
on the UFC point data submenu, selecting the point as the current steer
point (Menu 1, PB #10), then overflying the point and pressing PB #16
(O/F UPDT) on the TSD display to accomplish the update (Figure D-7).
This procedure updates the INS directly (no Kalman filtering); so
obviously, this capability must be used very judiciously. Again, the TSD is
available only in the rear cockpit with CC failure.

PACS

CC failure results in the loss of the ARMT display format and many PACS
capabilities, including all AIM-120 functions.

Remaining operable PACS functions/capabilities include:

AVI-12

Master arm (including RCP advisory light and the HUD gun
cross)

Weapons release (pickle) buttons

Manual free fall or retard (FF/RET) air-to-ground weapons
delivery (as selected with the FCP selective jettison knob)

AIM-7 (single target track [STT] or FLOOD)

AIM-9 boresight or uncaged shots (no seeker reference circles or
radar slaving available)

AIM-120 inhibited
The gun fires normally, but you cannot select firing rate or
set/monitor rounds count. The gun cross or manual sight

provide the only aiming references.

Air-to-air and air-to-ground selective jettison (no combat jettison
[CBT JETT])

Emergency jettison (“panic button”)


Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_17.jpeg:
The following is a short synopsis of available combat capability.

A/G Radar Real beam map (RBM) only, no high
resolution map (HRM). No RCP control
of radar.

A/G Weapons Delivery Visual, noncomputed deliveries only.

Sight depression angle can be entered
on UFC Menu 2. (RET 0 replaces
GCWS and 0-250 mils are selectable
through a UFC scratchpad entry).

A/A Radar Range-while-search (RWS), single
target track (STT), and track while scan
(TWS). No RCP control of radar.

A/A Weapons Delivery Employment of AIM-7s/AIM-9s. No
AIM-120 capability (AIM-120 launch

initiate is inhibited).

Caution Functional Capability

With CC failure, the MPDP continues to support all systems that have a
display caution capability. The warning, caution, and advisory lights also
work normally for the available systems. The main difference is visual,
with the cautions displayed on the radar format only (Figure D-8). The
displayed cautions do not blank out any background display
(nonoccluded). Selecting the radar format for display provides any display
cautions, even if the radar is off or inoperative. Obviously, with the
illumination of the master caution and/or other caution lights, you would
call up a radar display and check the display cautions. The built-in test
(BIT) system is a CC function, so with CC failure, there is no BIT display
available, and the BIT system is inoperative.

The principal corrective action available to the aircrew whenever CC
failure occurs or is suspected, is to press the CC reset button located on

Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_23.jpeg:
DOUBLE GENERATOR FAILURE

The aircraft electrical system provides full capability to the normal
avionics systems as long as at least one main generator is on-line.
However, if neither main generator is on-line (i.e., double generator
failure), avionics systems are affected as follows.

Failure Indications

Failure of both main generators results in the immediate blanking of the
HUD and all MPDs/MPCDs, except the FCP MPCD, which defaults to the
ADI format (Figure D-10). No other display format is available. Double
generator failure includes failure of the central computer, so all the
failures induced by a CC failure are also induced by double generator
failure. However, many of the backup capabilities available with a CC
failure are unavailable with a double generator failure. A CC failure
backup, for example, provides four steer mode selections on the ADI. With
double generator failure, only the NAV steer mode is available, because
the TACAN and ILS systems, themselves, are inoperative.

Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_24.jpeg:
As shown in Figure D-10, display cautions are displayed at the bottom of
the ADI. These cautions can be removed or recalled by moving the pilot’s
castle switch in any direction. The warning, caution, and advisory lights
are fully supported (assuming the emergency generator is operating in
AUTO/MAN). Display blanking and illumination of numerous caution
lights (about 7, including L GEN/R GEN) is the big clue to double
generator failure, along with landing gear unsafe indications (horn/light in
gear handle), because the ADC is not powered.

Functional Capability

TO 1F-15E-1 and TO 1F-15E-1CL-1, Emergency Power Distribution,
provide a complete list of operative/inoperative systems with double
generator failure. The following is a partial list of lost avionics
capabilities.

CC ILS AIU 2 AHRS (prior to GPS)
ADC/ADP PACS HUD OWS

MPDs AAI KY-58 AOA GAUGE

RCP MPCDs UHF 2 TEWS VVI gauge

TACAN RALT ADF

With double generator failure the following avionics components remain
operative (assuming the emergency generator is operating in AUTO or
MAN modes).

MPDP (supports FCP MPCD with ADI only)

UFC (degraded since the CC has failed with double generator failure)

FCP MPCD (ADI only)

INS and EGI (after GPS installation - backup attitude/heading only)

IFF (EMER only)

UHF 1 (UHF 2 is inoperative)

Intercom

AIU 1

Standby ADI, altimeter, airspeed indicators (AOA and VVI are
unpowered)

AVI-12 D-18


Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_25.jpeg:
NOTE

The emergency generator switch may require cycling to the ISOLATE
position and back to the AUTO position to obtain the ADI on the front
cockpit MPCD. On aircraft before 89-0497, if a double generator

failure occurs, the front cockpit MPCD may not receive enough power
to operate and consequently the ADI display will be lost. If this occurs,
use the standby flight instruments, which will still be operational
(except AOA and VVI).

Corrective Action

Accomplish the double generator failure procedure. If one main generator
can be brought back on-line, all the avionics equipment will again be
operative. If this is not possible, use the operating avionics (listed in

TO 1F-15E-1CL-1) to return to base. Double generator failure is obviously
an emergency procedure and depending upon conditions (night, bad
weather, etc.), can be a very serious situation. The only available cockpit
lighting is the storm flood lights and the utility lights.

MPDP FAILURE

The MPDP is powered as long as the MPDP/AIU 1 switch on the ground
power panel is in AUTO and aircraft power is available; i.e., at least one
main generator operating or the emergency generator operating in the
AUTO or MAN mode (not in ISOLATE). Internally (within the black box)
the MPDP is configured with four separate power supplies. As shown in
Figure D-11, display processing channels are powered to preclude loss of
the entire MPDP capability should a single power supply (P/S) failure
occur within the unit.

Failure Indications
Partial Failure

Partial failure usually results from a MPDP internal power supply
malfunction and causes the loss of the displays and display formats as
shown in Figure D-11. At least one display should be available in each
cockpit. Available displays can be time-shared with available display
formats as mission requirements dictate.

AVI-12 D - 20


Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_27.jpeg:
Complete Failure

Complete failure of the MPDP usually results from a total failure of the
processor itself, or loss of power to the MPDP. The HUD and all the
MPDs/MPCDs go blank (or display STANDBY). If the CC is operating,
the UFC continues to function normally; however, if the CC and the
MPDPFP are both failed, the UFC is blank. The UHF radios continue to
operate but channel frequency changes are not possible (blank UFC).

Corrective Action

Corrective actions for failure of the MPDP consist of actions to restore
electrical power.

@ Ensure that at least one main generator is operating, or the
emergency generator is operating in other than the ISOLATE
mode (AUTO or MAN).

@ Ensure that the MPDP/AIU 1 switch on the ground power panel
is in the AUTO position (cycle as appropriate).

@ Ensure that an ECS overheat condition has not caused an
automatic avionics shutdown (ground operations, single engine).

@ On the ground, with a partial failure, perform (if available) a
DSPL (MPDP) BIT.

@ There are three MPDP circuit breakers on the No. 2 circuit
breaker panel (left side, rear cockpit).

@ The most effective action is to reset the MPDP by cycling the
MPDP/AIU 1 switch on the ground power panel to OFF and
back to AUTO.

Obviously, with no displays available, your capabilities are seriously
degraded. All standby instruments are operational (assuming generator
power). Additionally, the UFC Data 1 display provides altitude, speed,
and bearing/range to NAV points. However, with no displays available,
there is no means to get TACAN or ILS steering.

Text from AVI-12_Degraded_Avionics_Operations_page_28.jpeg:
AIU FAILURES

The AlUs (AIU 1 and AIU 2) provide the interface between the aircrew
and aircraft systems; e.g., turn on, turn off, select modes, change
channels, etc. AIU failures manifest in the loss of continuity between a
switch/button and the avionics equipment itself. If the failure is an
internal processor failure, the equipment remains in its last operating
state (OFF/ON, mode selected/deselected). If the failure is an internal
power supply failure, then the equipment is, in effect, turned off. The
equipment is still operable, but is isolated from the avionics system.

Three possible AIU malfunction conditions may exist:
@ Partial failure of either or both AIUs.
@ Total failure of either AIU.
@ Total failure of both AIUs.

Failure Indications

Partial AIU Failure

Initial notifications of partial (or total) failure of either AIU may be
indicated by:

AIU 1 CAUTION displayed on the MPD/MPCD
(Figure D-12). Cautions (lights and display cautions)
are unreliable and are not displayed.

AIU 1 or 2 Illumination of the AV BIT caution to alert the aircrew
to check the BIT status. If AIU 1 has failed a BIT, the
legend “AIU 1” appears in the BIT failure window. If
AIU 2 has failed a BIT, the legend “AIU 2” appears in
the BIT failure window.

Total Failure of Either AIU

Total failure of AIU 1, ATU 2, or both AIUs results in the inability of the
aircrew to interface with, or complete loss of, the equipment as depicted in
Figure D-13.

Equipment with a redundant backup capability (Figure D-13, center
column) continues to function normally with complete failure of either
AIU. All components without redundant capability are affected when
their associated AIU fails (Figure D-13).

Total Failure of Both AIUs

Remember, if failure results from internal processor failure(s), the
components remain in the last position and are usable (for example, the
affected UHF would operate, but frequency change would not be possible).
A malfunction which causes an internal AIU power failure causes the
components to be unusable (AIUs are used to turn on equipment). Loss of
both AIUs blanks rows 1 through 6 on both cockpit UFCs and all control
stick avionics switch functions (HOTAS) are lost, except for weapons
release (pickle) buttons and the FCP trigger. Throttle switch functions
are also lost, except the speed brake switch.

Corrective Action

With partial AIU 1 failure and/or partial or total AIU 2 failure, a possible
corrective action is to run an AIU BIT.

Corrective action for AIU 1 failure is to cycle the MPDP/AIU 1 switch on
the ground power panel. You should use this action judiciously, since
cycling the MPDP blanks all the displays momentarily or perhaps longer
if the MPDP does not reinitialize. Try the AIU BIT before cycling the
MPDP/AIU 1 switch.

ADC/ADP Failure

The primary indications of ADC/ADP failure are OFF displayed for
vertical velocity, calibrated airspeed, and barometric altitude, and loss of
AOA on the HUD/ADI. There is a warning light (unsafe gear indication)
in the landing gear handle and a PITCH RATIO display caution. The
standby VVI and AOA gauges display OFF flags. If airborne, the landing
gear warning tone activates and can be silenced by the landing gear
warning tone silence button adjacent to the landing gear handle. Due to
the various system interfaces, information normally provided by the
ADC/ADP (to the CC for instance) is lost and may cause navigation/attack
steering to become unreliable. The ADC/ADP requires at least one main
generator for power. There is an ADC/ADP circuit breaker in the rear
cockpit. Other than that, the aircrew has no control over the ADC/ADP.

VVI (both cockpits) - Displays an OFF flag if electrical power is lost or
information is not valid (ADC/ADP failure).

Standby ADI (both cockpits) - Displays an OFF flag if power is lost or the
gyro is caged.

AOA indicator (front cockpit only) - Displays an OFF flag if electrical
power is lost, information is not valid (ADC/ADP failure), or if an internal
failure occurs.

HUD

If you experience difficulties with the HUD, ensure it is turned on and
that brightness/contrast controls are properly set. From a BIT display
format, selecting MAINT, then DSPL allows the aircrew to perform a
HUD BIT or select the backup (secondary) HUD graphics processor at
PB #12 (Figure D-21). The P or S at PB #12 indicates which processor
(primary or secondary) is selected. There are three HUD circuit breakers
on CB panel No. 2 (left side, rear cockpit).

When the CC fails, the MPDP becomes the system controller and provides
degraded operation of selected system components and displays to provide
a self-defense and return to base capability.

This lesson covers how failures affect those systems whose degrades/
failures have not been previously presented. Since normal operation for
these systems has been covered, we will discuss only the avionics system
malfunction indications, modified capability, and corrective actions.

A chart showing system/component status relative to various avionics
failures is found in Table D-1. You may find it helpful to refer to it as you
read the text in order to understand the “big picture” for each avionics
failure.

CC FAILURE

Total CC failure is usually obvious; however, some malfunctions and
partial failures may be insidious. Since most system data is used for more
than one function, other systems and equipment should be checked
anytime a CC malfunction is suspected. Only total CC failure is
addressed in this workbook.

Failure Indications

MPDs/MPCDs

The most obvious indicator of total CC failure is presented on the
MPDs/MPCDs. When total CC failure occurs, the MPDP becomes the
avionics system controller and defaults the MPDs/MPCDs to a set display
format. You may find it helpful to think of this as a “CC failure master
mode.” These initial displays are the underlined formats in Figure D-2.
Following the initial default, the displays can be scrolled through the
other available display formats.

BASIC SYSTEM COMPONENTS
Central Computer System

System Description

The central computer system performs computations for aircraft
navigation and weapon delivery/control, and maintains the system
displays using information received from the other avionic components
and sensors. The received data is used during the OFP execution to
compute aircraft position, velocity, altitude, attitude for navigation,
weapon delivery and display functions. The central computer system is
made up of many components, including the central computer (CC) and
the avionics mux buses, which are discussed below.

To aid your understanding of the avionic system operation, the
components are grouped by function (Figure D-1). The avionic system
functional block diagram graphically depicts the CC as the “heart” of your
weapons system. The avionics are designed to allow information to flow
back and forth between the CC and other systems. This design allows
information to be redundantly displayed and easily manipulated.

Central Computer

Description

The very high speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) CC is a high speed, stored
program, general purpose digital computer that receives data from control
panels and subsystems aboard the aircraft and performs mission oriented
computations on that data. The CC ADA-based software program (OFP)
provides the computer with guidance to perform its different functions.
The CC itself is made up of three central processing units (CPUs) with 512
K of nonvolatile memory per CPU (1536 K total). The CC operates at a
minimum of 3 million instructions per second (8 MIPS) per CPU when
performing the OFP. Two CPUs carry out primary functions while the
third works as a “shadow” processor, backing up important routines being
processed by the other two. The CC is powered as long as one main
generator is on-line. A built-in CC battery keeps memory alive during
periods when generator power is not available, including when the CC is
shut down between flights.

D-5 AVI-1


Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_12.jpeg:
The following descriptions of components are specific to the F-15E.

Central Processing Unit (CPU): the CPU controls the instruction
execution sequence; processes the interrupt, arithmetic and logic
functions; does the calling and storing of data, and interfaces with other
aircraft equipment and avionic systems.

Input/Output W/O) Section: the I/O section provides mux bus channel and
data interface with other aircraft equipment and avionics systems via the
mux buses.

Main Memory Storage (MS): the MS provides storage for the OFP, data
from other aircraft equipment and avionics systems, CPU data, and the
self-test program. The main store consists of random access memory
(RAM) backed up by nonvolatile core memory.

Power Supply: the power supply is controlled by the CC switch on the
GND PWR panel. The power supply then converts the aircraft AC input
power to operating voltages required for computer circuits.

Mission Cartridge (MC) and Data Transfer Module (DTM): mission
information can be loaded into the CC via the MC and/or DTM. The MC
and DTM are programmed in the squadron and carried to the aircraft.
Once inserted into their receptacles in the FCP they can be “read” to
initialize mission data in the CC.

Function: of primary concern to the aircrew is that the OFP is the
program loaded into the CC that contains the instructions for processing
data necessary to do radar, general navigation, and weapon delivery
computations. Certain computer tasks are accomplished based on aircrew
desires. Basically, the CC provides the following capabilities to the
aircrew:

e Air-to-air steering and launch envelope computations for missiles
and gunnery computations.

e Air-to-ground steering and release for A/G weapons.

e Steering to sequence points, mark points, targets of opportunity
and TACAN stations, including instrument approaches.

e Avionics control via software programmable display formats.

AVI-1 D-6


Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_13.jpeg:
To accomplish these tasks, the CC OFP is made up of nine program
modules, each being a complete routine that does a specific part of the CC
program. These programs are contained within the main memory storage
of the CC, as shown previously in Figure D-2.

Most modules work in conjunction with other CC modules and other CC
equipment to accomplish these tasks. All functional modules are
processed under Executive Module control. Each module’s capabilities are
briefly outlined below. This is familiarization information only. Some
modules are discussed in more detail in later lessons.

@ CC Simulator Support Module
e Provides interface with the simulator host computer. (This
allows the F-15E simulator to use the same CC as the aircraft.)
This module is inactive during aircraft operations.

CC Subroutine Programs

The CC maintains subroutine programs within certain modules. The
programs access module-related data and, along with CC-stored
algorithms, generate new/backup data for aircrew use. Two subroutines
of note are the overload warning system (OWS) and mission navigator
(MN).

OWS - calculates aircraft maximum allowable G. Provides the
aircrew with aircraft overload conditions for dynamic flight. OWS
data is stored in CC memory for recall.

MN - corrected present position and velocity data. Allows position
and velocity updates independent of the GPS/INS. The data is also
used by the CC as a backup for INS present position and velocity.

Both the OWS and MN functions are covered in detail in later lessons.

AVI-1 D-8


Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_15.jpeg:
Avionics Mux Buses

Normal Operation

As long as the CC is operational, it is the bus controller, or monitor, for all
mission data transfers between the CC and other avionic subsystems.
This is accomplished through the interface with two types of avionics mux
buses (the 1553 and H009). Each mux bus has primary (1, 2, and 5A) and
secondary (3, 4, and 5B) channels for the simultaneous transmission of
digital data. The secondary channels provide a redundant backup to the
avionics subsystems if the primary mux buses fail. The mux buses allow
the CC to interface with the:

Air data computer (ADC)/air data processor (ADP-with GPS)
Attitude heading reference set (AHRS)

Programmable armament control system (PACS)

Tactical electronic warfare system (TEWS)

Automatic flight control system (AFCS)

Radar

Avionics status panel (ASP)

Avionic interface units (AIU 1 & 2)

Engine diagnostic units (EDUs)

Global positioning system (GPS) (After TCTO 1F-15E-737)
Inertial navigation system (INS)

LANTIRN systems (TFR, NAV FLIR, TGT IR)
Multipurpose display processor (MPDP)

Digital map system (DMS) (After TCTO 1F-15E-700)
Signal data recorder system (SDRS)

CC Backup Operation

When the CC determines that it is in a no-go condition, it applies a no-go
command to the MPDP. This activates the MPDP software to take
command of one of the avionics mux buses. The MPDP becomes the
primary bus controller and is then able to communicate with the avionic
systems connected to that data bus. The MPDP receives data normally
acquired by the CC. A CC reset button in the FCP allows the pilot to
attempt a reset in the event of CC failure. CC failure is covered in detail
in the Degraded Avionics lesson.

Multipurpose Display System

System Description

AVI-1


Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_16.jpeg:
The multipurpose display system provides visual representation of flight,
navigation, attack, target, weapon and advisory data. The multipurpose
display system is made up of many components, including the
multipurpose display processor (MPDP) and the display’s mux buses,
which are discussed below.

Multipurpose Display Processor

Description

The MPDP is a multichannel video signal processor and symbol generator
that processes avionic subsystem data for the multipurpose display
system. It simultaneously drives eight display channels—one channel
dedicated to each display. The eight displays include four multipurpose
displays (MPDs), three multipurpose color displays (MPCDs) and the
head-up display (HUD) (Figure D-3). The MPDP is fully powered as long
as one main generator is on-line. It retains partial capability as long as
the emergency generator is operating (in AUTO or MANUAL).

Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_17.jpeg:
Function

The MPDP serves as a video processing and distribution center. It
produces stroke symbology and background video information for the
MPDs, MPCDs, HUD and the video tape recorder system (VTRS). The
MPDP converts all displays to composite video for the VTRS.

Operation

The CC supplies macro instructions (display data) to the MPDP as
directed by the CC OFP, which defines the displays to be produced. The
CC tells the MPDP which symbol(s) is (are) required, which display to put
them on, and at what grid location (x and y coordinates) to put them. The
MPDP has four separate power supplies and is designed so that failure of
one channel will not cause failure of the entire MPDP. Each power supply
drives two complete display channels. The MPDP/AIU 1 switch on the
GND PWR panel controls power to the MPDP power supply.

Display Mux Buses

Normal Operation

As long as the CC is operational, it is the primary display controller for
the MPDP. Display data transfer between the CC and MPDP occurs on
the display’s mux bus. The display’s mux bus has primary and secondary
channels (6A and 6B) for the simultaneous transmission of digital data.
The secondary channel provides a redundant backup to the MPDP if the
primary mux bus fails.

CC Backup Operation

A CC no-go signal is provided to the MPDP which causes the MPDP to
provide backup displays and avionics mux bus control. The MPDP
communicates and maintains the interface with the systems that are
required to provide the capability for returning to base and self-defense.
This includes a limited amount of display system formats. MPDP
degrades and failure will be covered in detail in the Degraded Avionics
lesson.

Avionics Interface Unit (AIU) Set

Description

The AIU set is composed of two AIUs (AIU 1 and AIU 2). Each AlUisa
signal processor used to control signal interfacing among the avionic
system components.

Function

The AIU set provides interfacing between the HOTAS controls/UFCs and
equipment being controlled. The AIU set also provides:

e Interface between the FCP/RCP UFCs

e Connection between the HOTAS controls/UFCs and the
components being controlled

e Memory for UHF preset channels

e Audio signal volume control (UHF, TACAN, warnings, etc.) from
the RICP/ICSCP

e Cautions, warnings and advisories

AIU 1 acts as primary bus controller for the digital database between the
UFCs and AIU 2. AIU 2 acts as backup bus controller for the digital
database between the UFCs and AIU 1. AIU 2 assumes control of the
digital data base when AIU 1 fails and performs all functions of AIU 1
except for control of equipment exclusively interfaced by AIU 1. Both
AITUs are normally powered by the main generators. AIU 1 will function
with emergency generator power only (AUTO or MANUAL).

Operation
Aircrew control of aircraft avionic systems is accomplished with the

HOTAS controls and UFCs. HOTAS/UFC input signals are processed by
the AIUs for interfacing with applicable systems.

communication between AIU 1 and AIU 2. AIU 1 functions as the
primary UFC bus controller. AIU 2 is the secondary UFC bus controller.
The UFC sends keyboard/pushbutton control data and status information
to the AIU set via the UFC data bus. The AIU set sends menu and
display data to the UFC.

Normal Operation

The AIU set communicates with the CC by way of the avionics mux bus.
Information that is transferred between the AIU set and the CC includes
UFC display and control data, avionic systems modes, controls and status
data, cautions/warnings/advisories and UHF/IFF initialization data.

CC Backup Operation

The AIU set communicates with the MPDP by way of the avionics mux
bus since the MPDP becomes the avionics mux bus controller in this
situation. Transfer of the same information (listed above) now takes place
between the AIU set and MPDP.

Air Data Computer (ADC) or Air Data Processor (ADP)

Description

The ADC is a digital computer that converts analog data input into a
digital output format. The ADC will be replaced by the ADP after
TCTO 1F-15E-737. This change should be transparent to the operator.

Function

The ADC/ADP receives input from system sources shown on the left side
of Figure D-5, corrects these errors for installation error, computes and
provides required data to aircraft equipment and cockpit displays shown
on the right side of Figure D-5. It also performs data validity checks and
sets off appropriate cautions and warnings.

Operation

ADC/ADP system operation is automatic with no in-flight control
available. The ADC/ADP receives power as long as one main generator is
on-line. The FCP standby altimeter BARO SET knob is the only control
provided for changing the aircraft barometric altimeter setting.

Attitude Heading Reference Set (AHRS)

Description

The AHRS is a gyromagnetic compass system that is composed of:

Directional gyro (DG)

Magnetic azimuth detector (MAD)
Electronic control amplifier (ECA)
Compass control panel (CCP)

Installing GPS hardware (via TCTO 1F-15E-737) will result in removal of
the AHRS. The functions of the AHRS will be replaced by a system called
the EGI-INS or simply EGI. The EGI consists of a single hardware box
containing both a GPS receiver and processor and a second independent
aircraft ring laser gyro INS. The previous aircraft INS becomes (for
terminology) the fighter navigation unit INS (FNU-INS). Both the
FNU-INS and the EGI are covered in detail in a follow-on Avionics lesson.

Function

The magnetic azimuth detector (MAD) provides magnetic heading during
initial INS alignment. The AHRS provides magnetic heading to various
avionic systems and attitude backup in the event of INS failure (or if
AHRS is aircrew-selected as the aircraft attitude source from the ADI
display format).

AVI-1 D-16


Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_23.jpeg:
Operation

The AHRS interfaces with the CC to provide heading and attitude backup
when the CC determines that INS data is invalid. It receives power as
long as one main generator is on-line.

The AHRS is controlled via the compass control panel (CCP) (Figure D-6).

AVI-01-06

Figure D - 6. AHRS CCP.

The CCP Controls Are:

Mode Selector Knob

COMP

DG

This mode is usually selected only when there is a
gyro malfunction. The heading is sensed from the
MAD and passed to other aircraft systems. The
AHRS acts the same as a standby compass and is
reliable only in straight and level flight.

The heading is sensed from the DG. The DG mode is
used in latitudes higher than 70° (or where the earth
magnetic field is distorted). When first selected, the
magnetic heading must be set into the system with
the PUSH TO SYNC knob. DG is also used during
MAD failure to stabilize heading.

This is the normal setting. The heading is sensed
from the DG and is continuously corrected by the
MAD and passed to other systems.

This is a combination push-to-sync and push-to-turn
(set heading) knob. Two situations apply:

Depress the knob to allow the AHRS to provide fast
synchronization of the DG magnetic heading output
to the MAD.

With AHRS selected on the ADI, depress and rotate
the knob to slew the AHRS heading on the HSI
compass card. The HUD heading readout will not be
affected, unless there is a failure in the INS heading.

With the mode selector in the SLAVED position, this
meter indicates the difference (plus or minus)
between the DG and the MAD headings.

With AHRS selected on the ADI, to correct an
obvious disagreement between the ADI and the
visually confirmed aircraft attitude, depress the
button to re-erect the AHRS gyro. Maintain wings
level, one G flight until the process is complete. The
AHRS will indicate invalid BIT outputs during the
fast erect process.

Set switch to your current hemisphere.
Set to present position latitude. In the DG and

SLAVED modes, the AHRS determines the correction
required for gyro drift due to the earth's rotation.

TEXT
AVIONIC SYSTEM ORIENTATION

The avionic system is designed around a software driven central computer
(CC) which provides control and integration of the various aircraft avionic
components (hardware and software). The CC utilizes the avionics
systems and subsystems effectively as ONE weapon system. This design
concept, together with the design of the missionized cockpits, constitutes a
major change over previous fighter aircraft.

On earlier aircraft, avionic systems were “hardwired” to cockpit control
panels and each system’s information was displayed on independent dials
and gauges. This resulted in crowded cockpits and instrument panels.

When computers were initially included in avionic systems, some system
integration was made possible; however, control was still managed
through hardwired control panels. Use of the inertial navigation system
(INS) for computed weapons release is an example of initial system
integration. Other systems such as TACAN, UHF radio, IFF, radar, etc.,
operated independently of each other.

As the evolution of avionics continued, more systems either were
internally designed with computer capabilities or were designed to receive
information from other systems. The increased computer capability
required the creation of operational flight programs (OFPs). The added
increase in overall avionic system integration required the creation of
common communication channels (mux buses). Command and control of
such a powerful, complex avionic system required the creation of a
common, single-source component that could be programmed to manage
the entire system effectively, hence, the central computer.

The F-15E central computer allows for a high degree of avionic system
integration as it accepts inputs and provides data for most onboard
systems. A multipurpose display system eliminates the need for
individual scopes, dials and gauges. The upfront control (UFC) replaces
most cockpit control panels. The system OFPs are designed to reduce
aircrew workload and allow for flexibility in the operation of aircraft
systems.

AVI-1


Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_8.jpeg:
The avionic systems include all communication, control, nav aids, displays
and sensors. Control of most systems is available from either cockpit.

Avionic System OFPs

OFPs are the “software” or tapes that drive the avionic system’s
“hardware” or black boxes. There are 16 OFPs in the F-15E; the
breakdown is as follows:

Central computer (CC)-1

Multipurpose display processor (MPDP)-2

Avionics interface unit (AIU) set-3

Flight control computer (FCC)-2

Inertial navigation set (INS)-1

Programmable armament control system (PACS)-1

Radar-1

Radar warning receiver (RWR)-1

Internal countermeasures set (ICS)—1

Countermeasure dispenser (CMD)-1

LANTIRN navigation pod—1 (plus an additional OFP for the F-16)
LANTIRN targeting pod—1 (plus an additional OFP for the F-16)

Computer Talk

You have already been bombarded with terms and acronyms that may
have meant nothing to you up to now. But it is important that you
understand what a few of them mean before continuing this lesson,
because you will hear and use these terms daily. Remember that on all
flights you will be manipulating many systems (hardware) that have their
own OFP tapes (software) and computer sections. If you were not
computer literate before, you will be soon!

Interface is how the aircrew “talks” to systems for power on/off, changing
channels, setting frequencies, etc. It does not reflect system status, i.e.,
you can lose interface with an avionic system that is still operating
normally. What this usually means is that you will still be able to use the
system on whatever channel/frequency/mode that was selected when
interface was lost.

AVI-1 D-2


Text from AVI-1_Avionics_Introduction_page_9.jpeg:
Nonvolatile Memory (NVM) is permanent memory space. Data placed
here is retained even when the power source is no longer available (like at
engine shutdown). Like any other computer, the CC has program
commands that are executed when power is applied to “set it up” for
normal operations.

Random Access Memory (RAM) is transient or “volatile” memory space.
Data placed here is lost when the power source is no longer available. In
any computer, RAM is the “working space” available for manipulating
data for programs. Once the data is sent elsewhere or no longer needed,
this space is “wiped clean” so that it will be available again for other
programs.

Multiplex (Mux) Buses are essentially the connections between the CC
and the various avionics systems that allow multiple electronic signals to
be transmitted along multiple paths and directions. The most common
signals used are called “words” and can be either command, status or data
words.

Mux Bus Failures are faults that are stored and can be viewed by the
aircrew in the CC NVM when a mux bus has failed a CC-initiated mux
test. Because of the complexity, integration and the large amount of
communication between the CC and other avionics systems, it is
necessary that the CC ensure that the mux bus channels stay in
synchronization and pass valid signals. The CC monitors the status of the
mux buses by sending out a “test select word” every second to every
avionic component on each mux bus. The mux bus failure data can be
cleared from the CC NVM by the aircrew. This procedure is in the built-in
test (BIT) lesson.

Bus Controller is an avionic system component that is programmed to be
“in control” of one or more mux buses and their operations. Being a bus
controller is the equivalent to being the “master terminal” in a computer
network setup, with the rest of the avionic system components being
“remote terminals” or “peripherals.”

DISPLAYS, CONTROLS, AND INDICATORS
Power Switch

This rocker switch is used to turn the MPD/MPCD on or off (Figure D-4).
This switch rests in the center-off position. On power up, the MPD/MPCD
comes up at 50% default brightness level and is fully active. The
day/night switch on the interior lights control panel controls the default
brightness level. The displays initialize to the format/selections which
were last selected prior to shutdown. Momentary power interruptions do
not require cycling the switch.

Brightness and Contrast Switches

These two rocker switches are used to adjust the brightness and contrast
of stroke and/or raster video for display (Figure D-4). They do not affect
the sensor gain sent from the MPDP. The switches rest in the center-off
position. Backlighted arrows on the switches indicate where to push for
an increase or decrease in intensity.

BIT Indicator

The BIT indicator or ball (Figure D-4) is magnetically controlled and rolls
over from black to white when the MPD/MPCD has failed. It will
automatically reset when the malfunction is corrected or after a display
power on/off cycle, and will hold the last indication when power is
removed. It may also be cleared by running a “Display,” “AUTO,” or
“MPDP” built-in test. An individual display BIT may be accomplished for
a specific display by selecting “MAINT,” “DISPLAY,” “THIS DISPLAY” on
the BIT 1 page, which will covered in a later lesson.

Push Buttons

The 20 push buttons mentioned earlier provide control of display
functions. By pressing them you can change display formats, select
display options, control subfunctions, etc. They are usually referred to by
the legend adjacent to them in a particular format; however, they can be
referenced by position number (Figure D-4). Notice that the push button
directly below the BIT ball is #1 and the sequence is counterclockwise
around the MPD/MPCD.

HOTAS Controls

The switches and buttons located on the FCP stick, the FCP throttles, and
RCP hand controllers are known as HOTAS (Hands On Throttles And
Stick) controls. Two of these switches, which control certain functions of

the MPD/MPCDs, are discussed here.

FCP Castle Switch

The front cockpit display control switch, called the castle switch because of
its shape, is a five-position, momentary contact toggle switch, located on
the stick (Figure D-5). It can be moved left, right, forward, aft, and
depressed. If a set of displays has been programmed on an MPD/MPCD,
toggling the switch toward the MPD/MPCD scrolls the display. Toggling
the switch toward the HUD alternately selects air-to-air or air-to-ground
master modes. Depressing, releasing, and toggling the switch toward a
MPD/MPCD or the HUD initiates the take command function. Display
scrolling, master modes, and the take command function are explained
later in this lesson.

they are shaped like coolie hats, are located on the left and right hand
controllers (Figure D-6). The left and right hand controllers allow control
and operation of the left and right set of MPD/MPCDs, respectively. The
coolie switch is a four-position, momentary toggle type that can be moved
forward/aft and left/right. If a set of displays has been programmed on
the MPDs/MPCDs, forward and aft movement of the coolie switch scrolls
displays. Left and right movement initiates the take command function.

So far you have just seen blank MPD/MPCD screens; however, this occurs
only if power is off or if a failure exists. Normally, there is something
displayed. Once you turn a unit on, it initializes to the format displayed
at shutdown. In all cases (except an armament display below the top

PROGRAMMING AND SCROLLING

Each MPD/MPCD can be programmed by the aircrew to sequentially
display up to three different formats. This allows the aircrew to
“optimize” the cockpit displays for specific missions or functions and
rapidly switch to other displays. The displays are scrolled by using the
castle switch in the front cockpit or the coolie switches in the rear cockpit
(HOTAS, remember?). FCP and RCP programming and scrolling
operations are completely independent of each other.

Programming

MPD/MPCD display sequence can be programmed through the MC/DTM
or in the aircraft. In the aircraft you can program all, some, or none of the
MPDs/MPCDs, as desired. Programming the displays is an easy
procedure as described below.

To program an MPD/MPCD, a menu must be displayed. Push the PROG
button; this initiates the programming mode and places a box around
PROG (Figure D-9).

Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_18.jpeg:
Select the display formats in the order you want for scrolling by pushing
the appropriate buttons in order. A boxed number 1, 2, or 3, and its
display format name appear in the center of the menu (Figure D-9). The
boxed sequence number also appears adjacent to the selected format.
These are program sequence numbers and they are assigned in the order
the buttons are pushed. You exit the programming mode by one of two
ways: (1) push the PROG button, which unboxes PROG, or (2) scroll off
the menu via HOTAS. For reference, the selected display formats and
their assigned program sequence numbers remain on the menus.

To replace one programmed format with another, select the programming
mode. Push the button of the programmed format you wish to delete; the
format name and boxed number disappears from the center of the menu
display. Then push the button of the format you wish to program; it
replaces the deleted display in the scrolling sequence. To reorder the
formats in the program, first delete all programmed formats. Next, select
the new formats in the desired scrolling sequence. Last, deselect “PROG”
or scroll to exit the program mode.

Similarly, toggling the switch to the right scrolls the right MPD. Toggling
aft does the same thing for the MPCD with one important variation. The
first aft movement of the castle switch brings up the ADI display on the
MPCD and starts a five second timing cycle. Further aft movement
within five seconds sequences the MPCD as programmed. Once the time
has elapsed, the next aft movement reinitiates this “ADI cycle.”

Rear Cockpit

The coolie switches on the left and right hand controllers perform the
display scrolling for their respective set of MPDs/MPCDs (Figure D-11).
In the figure below, the right hand control is used to scroll the right MPD
and MPCD. Toggling forward scrolls the MPD while aft scrolls the
MPCD. The left hand controller coolie switch scrolls the left displays
(forward for the left MPD, aft for the MPCD).

Master Modes

There is another way to change some or all of the programmed
MPD/MPCD display formats by pushing just one button. It allows rapid
transition between a set of systems and displays needed to conduct a
specific operation. This also simplifies operation and reduces crew
workload. This method uses the master mode buttons on the HUD control
panel (Figure D-12).

Figure D - 12. Master Mode Button Location.

Here is an example of how you might use master modes to change display
formats. On low level ingress you want specific display formats, like A/G
radar, TEWS, TGT IR, etc., arranged a certain way. These could be
programmed to the NAV Master Mode. However, if you are intercepted by
an enemy fighter, you need air-to-air systems and displays up
immediately! Punching the A/A Master Mode button could do just that in
a matter of seconds.

D-15 AVI-2


Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_22.jpeg:
Programming

Three of the master modes, air-to-air (A/A), air-to-ground (A/G), and
navigation (NAV), are programmable; the fourth, instrument (INST), is
“canned” or preprogrammed. The procedure for programming is as follows

(Figure D-138).

AVI-02-13

Figure D - 13.

AVI-2

First, select Menu 1 or Menu 2 on the
MPD/MPCD. Then select program (PROG) on
the menu displayed at PB #6. This initiates the
program mode and boxes PROG. Remember,
before a display format can be assigned to a
master mode, it must have a display sequence
number assigned to it.

Next, push PB #7 (M/M button) until the desired
master mode (A/G, A/A, NAV) appears. In this
case NAV is selected.

Push the button adjacent to the system display
format to be associated with that master mode.
The master mode legend will appear next to the
selected display format. This procedure is
accomplished for each master mode program
desired. Exit the programming mode by one of
the ways explained previously under
“Programming.”

Program all, some, or none of the MPDs/MPCDs,
as desired, for 1, 2, or 3 of the programmable
master modes.


Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_23.jpeg:
Limitations

There are a few other things to remember about master mode
programming. One is that, if an MPD/MPCD is not programmed to a
given master mode, it does not change when that master mode is selected.
Second, you are always in a master mode; when power is applied to the
aircraft, it initializes to the master mode the aircraft was in at engine
shutdown, unless the weapons select switch isin GUNS. The aircraft
initializes to the A/A Master Mode in that case. Finally, remember that
the push of each master mode button changes MPD/MPCD displays to
whatever has been “tied” to master mode programming, which may be an
inconvenience to the other crew member - so crew coordinate on this
action. Finally, when in the A/G, NAV, or INST Master Mode, moving the
FCP castle switch forward (without depressing it first) selects the A/A
Master Mode. If in A/A Master Mode, pressing the castle switch forward
selects A/G Master Mode.

D-17 AVI-2


Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_24.jpeg:
Instrument Master Mode

The “canned” program for the Instrument Master Mode allows the crew to
quickly transition to a set of basic instrument displays consisting of the
air-to-air radar display on the left MPD, the ADI on the MPCD, and the
HSI on the right MPD in the FCP (Figure D-14). In the RCP the HSI and
ADI automatically come up on the left and right MPCDs, respectively.
The rear cockpit center two displays (left MPD, right MPD) do not change
with selection of the Instrument Master Modes.

GUNS

One other switch that brings up a master mode is the weapons/mode
switch on the right forward throttle (Figure D-15). By moving it aft to the
GUNS position, air-to-air radar is automatically displayed on the left front
MPD, and A/A Master Mode is selected. The left front MPD cannot be
programmed or scrolled with the switch in GUNS. The menu option at
PB #11 is shown, but not selectable. Scrolling off the air-to-air display is
not possible as long as the weapons select switch is in GUNS.

D-19 AVI-2


Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_26.jpeg:
TAKE COMMAND FUNCTION

Some displays on the MPDs/MPCDs require that a crew member take
command of them for system operation. (You would not want two people
trying to move the A/A radar cursor at the same time, would you?) The
systems with the take command function are: air-to-air radar (A/A RDR),
air-to-ground radar (A/G RDR), targeting IR (TGT IR), tactical situation
display (TSD), VID 2, VID 5, VID 8, and data frame. Other display
formats, such as the ADI, HSI, etc., can be manipulated with the push
buttons by either crew member at anytime. Needless to say, some crew
coordination is required for take command actions.

Taking Command

The crew member desiring to operate a “take command” system must take
command of it; command cannot be given. To take command, use the
same switches used to sequence displays. First, you must have the system
display format showing on one of your MPDs/MPCDs. In the front
cockpit, momentarily depress and release the castle switch and, within
two seconds, move it toward the MPD/MPCD you want to command
(Figure D-16). If the other crew member is not using the display, you now
command it.

Once a crew member is in command of a displayed system, visual
indications of command status appear on the display. With the A/A RDR,
for example, the cursor becomes solid, and short “command” lines appear
between the legends on the bottom row of the display format. A display of
the same system in the other cockpit will have a dashed cursor and no
“command” lines (Figure D-18).

If you attempt to take command of a display that is actively being used, as
defined below, a SYSTEM IN USE cue comes up on your display

(Figure D-19). If you still want command, repeating the take command
actuation(s) a second time within five seconds gives it to you.

IN USE is defined as follows:
A/A RDR - the cursor is being moved or a target is designated.

A/G RDR - the cursor or elevation bar is being moved, UPDATE or
TARGET function is selected, or a high resolution map is being made.

A/A or A/G RDR - when the HUD is in use for update or designation
functions. (This only appears if take command is initiated from the
RCP.)

Text from AVI-2_MPD-MPCD_page_30.jpeg:
Here is a limitation to remember about being in command. You cannot
command two displays simultaneously in the front cockpit or from one
hand controller in the rear cockpit. For example, if you are in command of
the A/G RDR format on the RCP right MPD with the TGT IR on the RCP
right MPCD, should you take command of the TGT IR, the A/G RDR will
go to neutral. (“Neutral” means that neither crew member is in command
of that system.) One exception exists in the FCP. In A/G master mode,
the pilot can be in command of the HUD and still fire the laser of the TGT
IR pod. Keep this in mind when you set up your cockpit display
programming. Also remember, the HOTAS switches are multifunctional.
The only way a HOTAS switch “knows” which system it is supposed to
affect is by “knowing” which system you “command.”

TEXT
DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION

The multipurpose displays (MPDs) and multipurpose color displays
(MPCD) are cathode ray tubes (CRTs) which integrate the controls and
presentations of many aircraft systems into a single unit. The F-15E is
among the first aircraft to make such extensive use of these displays.
They provide the aircrew a unique flexibility to display the data being
gathered by on-board sensors and guided weapons and to arrange and
control this data to accommodate individual mission needs.

The MPD and the MPCD look essentially the same (Figure D-1). The face
of the unit consists of a 6" screen (MPD) or a 5" screen (MPCD)
surrounded by 20 peripheral push buttons by which the aircrew controls
systems and data to be displayed. The exact content of data in the display
formats is software programmable and stored within the operational flight
program (OFP) of the multipurpose display processor (MPDP), making
changes much easier to accomplish. The MPD presents all display
formats in monochromatic green. The MPCD also presents
monochromatic displays; in addition, it shows complex displays like the
electronic attitude director indicator (ADD and horizontal situation
indicator (HSI) in color, which aids in their rapid, accurate interpretation.
Color maps are used on the tactical situation display (TSD) for ease in
assessing the tactical situation.

A brightness control knob (Figure D-3) provides a full range of LCD
lighting adjustment for night use. Since LCD is a reflective type display,
backlighting is not required for day operation.

Keyboard

The keyboard (Figure D-3) is arranged in a standard telephone style
matrix with an egg crate barrier between the keys to minimize
inadvertent selection. For keys which are labeled with two characters or
functions, access the top letter or function by first pressing and releasing
the shift (SHF) key, then the desired key.

Option Push Buttons (PBs)

The ten buttons allow data entry, power control, submenu access and
function selection. For reference, the buttons are numbered 1 through 10
counterclockwise, starting from the top left.

Data Entry: Pressing the appropriate button transfers data from the
scratchpad into the desired system. In some cases, if a system is off or
deactivated, it is simultaneously turned on/activated by the entry of
scratchpad data (LAW, TCN, IFF, AAI, ILS).

Power Control: Pressing the appropriate button turns the power on or off
to various systems. OFF follows the system legend if the system is
off/deactivated (Figure D-4, Left). System parameters follow the system
legend if the system is on/activated (Figure D-4, Right).

Submenu Access: With a clear scratchpad, pressing an option push button
calls up a submenu, where applicable.

Function Control: With a clear scratchpad, pressing an appropriate
system button selects or deselects a system function. Asterisks, as shown
in Figure D-4, indicate selection of modes or options.

When pressed, the EMIS LMT button (Figure D-6, top) stops all RF
transmissions from the aircraft (except for the radar altimeter and terrain
following radar). A caution/advisory light (Figure D-6, bottom) also
illuminates in both cockpits to alert the crew that the function has been

pressing the button next to the appropriate system legend on the LCD.

If the scratchpad entry is invalid (more keyboard entries are performed
than can be displayed in the scratchpad, or the format of entries is
inappropriate for the system you attempt to interface with) the scratchpad
flashes. To clear the incorrect data, press the CLR key once to stop the
flashing, and then press CLR again to clear the last digit. One more press
clears the entire scratchpad. If the scratchpad is not flashing, the first
press of the CLR key clears the last character entered; the second press
clears the entire scratchpad.

On the UFC keyboard (Figure D-7), the alphanumeric keys allow entry of
numbers, upper case letters and symbols. For example:

A, B, C for route Alpha, Bravo (or Base Point or
Bullseye) and Charlie

N, 8, E, W for North, South, East and West

M for mark point selection

Do for decimal point, colon and dash
(Route and mark point selection will be covered in the INS lesson.)

AVI-03-07

Figure D - 7. UFC Keyboard.

The function keys surrounding the alphanumeric keys are used to provide
for selection, change and entry of various types of data.

GREC SHF and then GREC activates/deactivates the guard
receiver on the appropriate UHF radio. Separate
selections are provided for each UHF radio (left side UHF
1, right side UHF 2).

C/M key shifts between the preset channel and the manual
UHF frequency. Separate selections are provided for each
UHF radio (left side UHF 1, right side UHF 2). An
asterisk signifies which is currently selected, manual
frequency or preset channel.

MARK The MARK key inputs and stores the aircraft’s present
position latitude and longitude and the time of day the
mark was made. Up to ten mark points can be input and
stored for future reference.

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_16.jpeg:
DECIMAL (.) The decimal is used when entering some types of
navigation points. Decimals can be used, but are not
required for numerical entries (UHF frequencies, ILS
frequencies, latitude/longitude coordinates, etc).

A/P The A/P key is used to engage the autopilot.

CLR The CLR key clears the scratchpad or the display
rows. Successive activation will (in turn) stop the
scratchpad from flashing, or clear the last character,
clear the scratchpad, blank the top four rows of the
LCD, and blank all rows of the LCD.

DATA The DATA key selects the Data 1 display or
alternately cycles between the two data displays
(DATA 1/DATA 2).

MENU The MENU key selects the Menu 1 display or

alternately cycles between the two menu displays
(MENU 1/MENU 2).

SHF To select the upper functions of the alphanumeric
keys, press SHF before pressing the desired key. The
system then automatically returns to lower case
alphanumerics; therefore, pressing the keys SHF, A,
1, 2, 3, will produce A, 1, 2, 3 not A, A, N, B.

I/P Initiates IFF identification of present position (IFF
IDENT POSITION).
FCP/RCP Integration

If both crew members access the same system, the last input from either
UFC provides the controlling data input; otherwise, all data entries of one
UFC are independent of the other UFC. Data being keyed into one UFC
scratchpad is repeated on the other UFC scratchpad if that scratchpad is
clear. (Repeated data cannot be entered; that is, scratchpad data can only
be entered from the UFC on which it was keyed). As soon as you start to
key data, any previous information on the scratchpad keyed from the
other cockpit clears automatically. You can also clear repeated data from
your scratchpad with the CLR key.

UHF RADIOS

The UHF system consists of two separate receivers and transmitters
(UHF 1 and UHF 2) which operate on manually selected and preset
frequencies within the 225.000 to 399.975 MHZ frequency range.

Each UHF radio has a guard (243.0) receiver that can be activated
through the UFC when the radio is operating.

Both UHF radios have provisions for anti-jam communications (HAVE
QUICK) and secure communications (KY-58). These capabilities will be
addressed in more detail in a subsequent academic lesson.

The UHF radios are operated by controls located on the:

Remote intercommunication control panel (RICP)—FCP only
Intercommunication set control panel (ICSCP)—RCP only
Throttles

Floor buttons—RCP only

The FCP RICP has two additional switches not found on the RCP ICSCP:
e The VHF antenna selector switch is presently inoperative.

e The UHF antenna selector switch allows the pilot to select the
upper or lower antenna for the UHF 1 radio. The AUTO position
causes the UHF 1 radio to automatically select the antenna with
the best signal. The UHF 2 always transmits and receives on the
lower antenna.

Throttles

A three-position microphone switch is located on the inboard throttle in
each cockpit for UHF transmissions (Figure D-14). Pushing the switch
forward allows you to transmit on UHF 1; pulling the switch aft allows
you to transmit on UHF 2. The switch is spring loaded to the center
receive position.

UHF POWER UP

After power is applied to the aircraft (first generator on-line), the UFC
displays Menu 1. UHF 1 frequency information is located on the left two
bottom lines of the UFC, UHF 2 is on the right side. “OFF” is displayed at
PB #5/PB 46 if the respective radio is off. In Figure D-16, left, UHF 1 and
UHF 2 are turned off. In Figure D-16 (bottom), UHF 1 is turned on and
set to preset channel 2, as signified by the asterisk on the bottom line of
the UFC (and the asterisk at PB #1 on the UHF 1 submenu).

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_31.jpeg:
There are five ways to apply power to a UHF radio.

The first way is to press PB #5 (PB #6) (with the scratchpad clear) to
bring up the UHF 1 (UHF 2) submenu (Figure D-16, right). The
absence of an asterisk (*) adjacent to U1 (U2) on the submenu [and
“U1 OFF” (“U2 OFF”) next to PB #5 (PB #6) on all UFC formats]
signifies that the UHF 1 (UHF 2) radio is off. Pressing PB #1 (still
with a blank scratchpad) applies power to the appropriate UHF radio
and displays the asterisk symbol showing that the radio is on. The
last entered manual frequency appears at PB #5 (PB #6) and an
asterisk appears adjacent to the last selected frequency type (i.e.,
manual or preset), as shown in Figure D-16, bottom. The same
procedure is used to turn on UHF 2 using PB #6 on MENU 1 to
display the UHF 2 submenu. The UHF 1 and UHF 2 submenus are
identical except for PB #1 (U1 or U2) and UHF 2 submenu does not
display ADF at PB #2.

A second way to apply power to a UHF radio is to enter a valid
channel number in the scratchpad and press the appropriate channel
select knob. The radio comes on and tunes to the selected channel.

A third way to apply power to a UHF radio is to enter a valid manual
frequency in the scratchpad and press PB #5 (UHF 1) or PB #6 (UHF
2). The radio comes on and tunes to the selected manual frequency.

A fourth way to apply power to a UHF radio is to turn the
appropriate channel select knob. This turns the radio on, selects
channel mode and increments the channel number.

A fifth way to apply power to a UHF radio is to press the appropriate
channel select knob with an empty scratchpad. The radio comes on
and tunes to the previously selected preset channel.

The only way to turn a radio off is to select the appropriate UHF
submenu and press PB #1. This removes power from the radio, the
asterisk from PB #1 and the selected frequency type. “OFF” appears
at PB #5/PB #6, as appropriate.

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_32.jpeg:
Manual/Preset Frequency Selection

Refer to the left display example in Figure D-17, which depicts preset
channel 2 selected on UHF 1. To select the manual frequency, 226.125,
press the left C/M (channel/manual) key. The asterisk moves to the
manual frequency (Figure D-17, right).

To return to the UHF 1 preset frequency, press the left C/M key again.
The asterisk moves to the preset channel. The same logic applies to UHF
2, except the right C/M key is used.

To select a specific manual frequency (for example, 314.65 on UHF 1),
press the desired numeric keys so that the new frequency is displayed in
the scratchpad and then press PB #5 (Figure D-20). To change the UHF 2
manual frequency you would press PB #6. The decimal point and trailing
zeros may, but need not be keyed. Inputting a manual frequency also
turns the radio on.

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_36.jpeg:
Use of Decimal and Colons

Generally, entries which have a fixed number of digits (fixed field) do not
require the entry of decimals or colons. An example of a fixed field is the
UHF radio frequency, which always requires three nondecimal digits. In
this case, the decimal need not be entered; the UFC automatically
displays the decimal between the third and the fourth digit when the
scratchpad entry is identified as a radio frequency (i.e., when PB #5 or
PB 46 is pressed).

Time may be entered without entering the colon and is assumed to have
two hour digits (thus, when entering time, leading zeros are required).
Trailing zeros are automatically added to the field. Examples of how
entries are made are shown in the following:

FIELD FORMAT UFC ENTRY UFC DISPLAY

Time XX:XX:XX 1 10:00:00
Time XX:XX:XX 01 01:00:00
Time XX:XX:XX 01355 01:35:50
UHF XXX. XXX 2265 226.500
UHF XXX. XXX 22 220.000
UHF XXX. XXX 226125 226.125

UHF Submenu

The UHF 1 and UHF 2 submenus are accessed by pressing PB #5 (UHF 1)
or PB #6 (UHF 2) with an empty scratchpad. These submenus allow:

Turning radios on/off,
Programming the UHF preset frequencies (channels),
Selection of the ADF function (UHF 1 only),
Selection of the HAVE QUICK (anti-jam) and KY-58 (secure voice)
functions, and
e Selection of Both Transmit (Both TX).
Programming a UHF Preset Frequency (Channel)

Select the desired UHF submenu. In our example, PB #6 calls up the
UHF 2 submenu. Note that the current preset channel (10) appears at PB
#1 and its frequency (229.000) appears at PB #10. To change this
frequency to 314.65, enter 31465 in the scratchpad (Figure D-21). Press
PB #10, and the new frequency (314.65) for preset channel 10 is displayed.
When initially entering the UHF submenu the current preset frequency is
displayed next to PB #1. To change the frequency of another channel,
type the channel number into the scratchpad and enter it at PB #1. The

AVI-3 D - 30


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_37.jpeg:
new channel's manual frequency is displayed next to PB #10 and can be
changed the same way as mentioned before. Note that the receiving and
transmitting channel has not been changed. This allows all other preset
channels to be changed while still monitoring the desired/assigned
channel, or all channels to be changed while monitoring a manual
frequency. Preset frequencies can be entered through a data transfer
module (DTM) or mission cartridge (MC).

Both TX (Both Transmit)

The capability exists to simultaneously transmit on two separate
frequencies. By selecting BOTH TX (PB #7) on either the UHF 1 or UHF
2 submenu, whenever transmission is attempted (with mic switch either
forward or aft, or RCP foot pedals), both radios transmit. This has certain
electronic protection (EP) benefits but can also cause embarrassment if
unknowingly selected. If BOTH TX is selected on either radio, an asterisk
appears next to PB #7 on both UHF submenus, indicating activation.

This should be checked during preflight ground ops. To deactivate, press
PB #7 (with a blank scratchpad). The asterisk disappears indicating
deactivation.

HAVE QUICK is a UHF radio anti-jam (AJ) function which changes
transmitter frequency many times per second.* HAVE QUICK is
activated by pressing PB #3 on the appropriate UHF 1 or UHF 2 submenu
(Figure D-25). Cycling the AJ option button activates/deactivates the
function for the appropriate radio. When AJ is activated, an asterisk

NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT
TACAN

The TACAN provides precise air-to-ground bearing and range information
to a maximum distance of approximately 300 miles (depending upon
aircraft altitude). It can also be operated in an air-to-air mode with
aircraft having similar equipment and provides line of sight distance
between two aircraft operating their TACAN sets 63 channels apart. Up
to five aircraft can determine their range from a sixth aircraft if their
TACAN sets are set 63 channels apart from that aircraft. Range is
limited to four times the distance between the lead aircraft and the
nearest aircraft. The sixth aircraft will be provided range from one of the
other aircraft, but cannot readily determine from which aircraft. A/A
TACAN information is normally limited to DME only; however, some
aircraft, such as the KC-10, can provide bearing also.

IFF/AAI SYSTEM

The F-15E IFF/AAT system directly interfaces with the UFC and includes
the IFF/SIF and air-to-air identification (AAI).

IFF

The identification system provides automatic identification when
challenged by a surface or airborne interrogator, as well as momentary
identification of aircraft position upon request. The IFF modes provided
are:

Mode 1 Mode 3 Mode C
Mode 2 Mode 4 A/B

Mode 4 is used for highest confidence identification (crypto), and Mode C
is used for altitude reporting.

Modes 1, 2, 3 and C are selected/deselected from the UFC. Mode 1 and
Mode 8 codes can be input from the UFC; Mode 2 codes are set from the
IFF transponder control box located in the aircraft nose (door 3R) and
cannot be altered in flight. Mode 4 is keyed by maintenance personnel.
Mode 4 controls are located on the RICP (FCP, left console) and the ICSCP
(RCP, left console).

which are selected from Menu 1. The IFF submenus are used to select
IFF modes and codes and to program IFF phasing (automatic timing).

Menu 1 provides initial IFF status and access to the IFF submenu. Modes
are displayed next to IFF anytime a mode is selected (activated) and
indicates that the IFF is being powered (Figure D-38). If Modes 1 through
3 and C are not activated (via the UFC), the Mode 4 selector switch is in

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_61.jpeg:
Activation or deactivation of modes (1, 2, 3, C) can be accomplished
through UFC Menu 1. Type the mode you wish to turn on/off in the
scratchpad and push PB #8. “3C” entry activates both Mode 3 and Mode
C. Ifthe mode was not displayed (off) prior to pushing PB #8, the mode is
activated (to the previously set code) and appears next to IFF along with
the other active modes. If the mode was displayed at PB #3 (on), the mode
is deactivated and the corresponding number/letter disappears. Mode 4
can only be activated/deactivated through the FCP RICP Mode 4 selector
switch.

The codes for Modes 1 and 3 may be changed (and the system turned on, if
off) directly from Menu 1 by typing in the mode, dash and code on the
keyboard (e.g., to change Mode 3 to 43821, press 3, SHF, -, 4, 3, 2, 1; verify
scratchpad entry; and press the IFF button). The entered mode and code
are displayed next to the IFF button for five seconds. The legend then
reverts to displaying the activated modes. The Mode 2 IFF code cannot be
changed from the cockpit. The Mode 4 codes (A or B) can only be selected
with the Mode 4 selector switch in the front cockpit. Mode 1 code entries
are limited to 0-7 for the first digit and 0-3 for the second digit; so the
lowest code is 00 and the highest is 73. Mode 3 code entries are limited to
0-7 for all digits; so the lowest valid code is 0000 and the highest is 7777.

The IFF submenu is selected by pressing the IFF button with a clear
scratchpad. The submenu allows access to the various functions (modes,
codes and programming) of IFF Modes 1, 2, 3 and C (Figure D-39). Mode
4 information is never displayed on the IFF submenu. Mode 4 control can

The IFF program submenu is used to program specific IFF modes and
codes to change as a function of time, which is referred to as “phasing”
(PH). Up to 18 different phases can be programmed. Only Modes 1, 2, 3
and C can be phased. Mode 4 must be changed manually on the FCP
RICP. Once activated, phasing is based on the CC/GPS clock time. As the
time passes the phase start time, the programmed modes and codes are
activated or deactivated automatically. Phasing is normally programmed
by the data transfer module (DTM); however, it can be manually
programmed or changed in the aircraft.

To enter the IFF phase programming submenu, press the PROGRAM
button. The asterisk adjacent to PROGRAM indicates that you are in the
IFF phase programming submenu. If IFF phases have been entered
either manually or by the DTM, a phase number appears next to PH at
PB #1. The selected modes, codes and time programmed for phase

AAI

The aircraft’s Air-to-Air Interrogator (AAI) set provides A/A target
identification capabilities to assist the aircrew in accomplishing a variety
of tasks. The following discussion addresses AAI and Enhanced
Identification (EID) in only a basic fashion. A detailed discussion will be
addressed in a follow-on lesson in the air-to-air radar block of instruction.
The capabilities can be used to assist in:

e finding aircraft on the air-to-air radar.

e determining on the radar, which friendly aircraft is which.

e determining on the radar if an aircraft is friendly or hostile [based
on predetermined Rules of Engagement (ROE)/Positive
Identification (PID) criteria].

The interrogator set transmits challenge signals and receives target IFF
replies through the L-band antennas mounted on the main radar antenna.
The system evaluates the replies and generates display symbols
(diamonds or circles) on the A/A radar display (or the A/G radar display)
at the correct target range and azimuth position.

The UFC, in conjunction with HOTAS activation, provides the
mechanisms for controlling/implementing the interrogation. The radar
(both A/A and A/G) provides us information concerning the progress and
results of our interrogation. AAI interrogation can be interfaced from
UFC Menu 1 or from the AAI or EID UFC submenus.

The aircrew can make UFC selections, which determine how the AAI
interrogation will be implemented. Any combinations of Modes 1, 2, 3 and
4 can be interrogated with a single HOTAS switch action. Modes 1
through 3 can be interrogated such that replies to the mode (regardless of
code) are displayed (normal mode) or such that the interrogated
transponder must reply with both the correct mode and the correct code
(correct code mode). Mode 4 AAI always functions in the correct code
mode, with the code being A, B or both A and B.

UPFRONT CONTROL COMPONENT DESCRIPTION AND
FUNCTION

The upfront control (UFC) is the primary interface between the aircrew
and numerous aircraft avionics. It is powered up on engine start when
the first main generator comes on-line and remains operating as long as
either a main generator or the emergency generator (in AUTO or
MANUAL) is on-line.

Use of the UFC is integral to the operation of the aircraft equipment and
allows crew members to control the following systems:

UHF radios—including automatic direction finding (ADF), HAVE
QUICK (anti-jam feature) and KY-58 (secure voice feature)
functions

Inertial navigation system (INS) (most functions, including
present position coordinate entry and navigation point
entry/selection)

TACAN

ILS (instrument landing system)

NAV FLIR (navigation forward looking infrared)

IFF/SIF (identification friend or foe/selective identification
feature)

AAI (air-to-air interrogator) and EID (enhanced identification)
A/P (autopilot)

LAWS (low altitude warning system)

GCWS (ground collision warning system)

The above list is not all-inclusive. Other capabilities controlled through
the UFC will be covered in subsequent academic lessons.

D-1 AVI-3

AAI Submenu

The AAI submenu is accessed from UFC Menu 1, PB #8 (Figure D-46,
left). On the AAI submenu (Figure D-46, right), Modes 1 through 3 can be
activated and their respective codes can be entered in exactly the same
manner as the IFF. As with the IFF submenu, the asterisks indicate
which modes are selected for interrogation. The “N” or “C” following each
mode identifies which master mode is selected for each mode. The “N” or
“C” can be changed from either Menu 1 or the AAI submenu utilizing the
scratchpad. The “N” or “C” can be entered separately (AAI submenu) or in
conjunction with a mode or mode/code change (from Menu 1), or in
conjunction with a code change from the AAI submenu. The “N” indicates
that correct mode replies will be shown on the radar. The “C” indicates
that only replies with the correct code will be shown on the radar for that
mode.

Additionally the legend will read AUTO ID-EID if
the AUTO feature is selected on the EID submenu.
STT, PDT, will be discussed again in later lessons.
For now, in simple terms, with AUTO ID, STT or
PDT selected, the system will automatically start
an AAT interrogation sequence cycling through all
modes selected on the AAI (or EID) submenu, when
the radar enters track on a target and that target
does not already have an AAI-ID associated with it
(from a previous interrogation). The sequence
commanded via the auto ID feature is the same as
would result from a manual interrogation (via

HOTAS).

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_72.jpeg:
HOTAS

Activate an AAI interrogation sequence (defined by the asterisked modes
on the UFC) with pilot coolie switch outboard for greater than 1 second or
RCP right hand control (RHC) AAI switch forward for greater than 1
second. The switch action locks in the sequence for the selected modes,
each for the selected number of bars. Either crew member can stop their
own initiated sequence with a second switch activation for greater than 1
second. The pilot cannot stop a RCP initiated sequence, or vice versa.

Interrogation

The legend in the lower left corner (Figure D-47) of the A/A radar cycles
through each selected mode/master mode (AAI 1N, AAT 2C, AAT 3N, etc.)
as each is interrogated. Diamonds (Modes 1, 2 and 3 reply or low
confidence Mode 4 reply) or circles (high confidence Mode 4 reply) are
displayed at the correct azimuth and range on the radar. At PB #8
(AAT/EID) on the UFC Menu 1, the modes, codes and master modes (C or
N) will cycle through as they are interrogated. Once the interrogation is
complete both the radar and UFC Menu 1 return to normal format.

The EID submenu allows AAI selections totally independent of the AAI
submenu. It is mechanized almost exactly like the AAI submenu, except
changes to the EID selections cannot be implemented from UFC Menu 1.
The legends on UFC Menu 1 showing selected modes and showing the
progress of an interrogation, as well as the A/A radar cues showing the
progress/results of an interrogation are the same as for AAI, except
information is prefaced by “EID” vice “AAI.” The HOTAS switchology is
the same, except the FCP coolie is moved inboard (vice outboard for AAT)
and the RCP interrogate switch is moved aft (vice forward for AAI). The
significance of PB #8 (“MX 2”) will be addressed at a later time.

D - 67 AVI-3


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_74.jpeg:
Obviously, the capability to program two separate interrogation sequences
on the AAI/EID submenus provides a great deal of flexibility. The
optimum way to use the capability is totally situation dependent. Another
lesson, in the A/A radar block of instruction, will further address AAI/EID.
For now, consider the following examples.

AVI-3

You are flying night trail formation beyond visual range of your
leader. You have programmed the AAI submenu to interrogate
your leader’s discrete Mode 1 code (M1-11C) and the EID submenu
to interrogate for VFR traffic (M3-1200C).

You are flying a combat mission escorting a strike package. You
have programmed the AAI submenu to interrogate the strike
package’s discrete mode (M2-7777C) and the EID submenu to fulfill
the ROE to discriminate enemy aircraft—absence of Mode 4A and
absence of Mode 1 (M4A and M1-11N).

You are flying a low level training mission, and for see-and-avoid
you want to interrogate for both VFR civilian traffic (M3-1200) and
VFR military special use airspace traffic (M3-4000). You program
M8-1200C on the AAI submenu and M38-4000C on the AAT
submenu. You use correct code because you do not want to see
replies from IFR traffic squawking Mode 3.

LAWS

The LAWS is designed to warn you of descent below a predetermined
altitude above ground level (AGL). It uses the radar altimeter for altitude
measurement.

Control and display for the LAWS is provided on the UFC, Menu 1, PB #1
(Figure D-53). The system is alternately enabled (to the last selected
value) and disenabled by pressing PB #1 with an empty scratchpad.
Enabled status is indicated by the selected altitude replacing OFF at PB
#1.

To change the altitude, type the new number into the scratchpad, and
then press PB #1. The new altitude replaces the old one and the
scratchpad blanks. If the LAWS is not enabled (“OFF”), entering the
scratchpad value enables the LAWS.

AVI-3 D-74


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_81.jpeg:
Warning Indications

In flight, if the actual aircraft AGL altitude goes below the LAWS
altitude, the LOW ALT warning lights and voice warning are activated.
The LAWS warnings are independent of the TF system. If the LAWS is
enabled on the ground, the LAWS does not provide the visual or aural
warnings until the aircraft climbs above the LAWS value and then
descends back down through the LAWS altitude. The LAWS warnings
also activate if the LAWS is enabled and the radar altimeter fails or if it
breaks track with aircraft parameters below 5000 feet (AGL), <60° roll
and <60° pitch.

The LAWS warnings (lights and voice) terminate if:
e The aircraft climbs at least 20 feet above the LAWS altitude.
e The LAWS function is turned off via the UFC.

e The LAWS altitude is changed to a value below the present aircraft
AGL altitude.

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_page_82.jpeg:
Ground Collision Warning System (GCWS)

The central computer (CC) utilizes aircraft inputs to provide visual and
aural warnings of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). It is a passive
system in that it provides no automatic recovery. Not all impending
CFITs produce a GCWS warning.

The CC uses inputs from the INS, ADC, FCC, ATUs, radar altimeter and
PACS to compute the altitude (AGL) to initiate the warnings. If OWOFF
or INVARM (stores identified on the PACS does not match aircraft-sensed
stores aboard) is displayed on the HUD, the GCWS is inoperative.

GCWS modes are aircrew selectable through UFC Menu 2 (Figure D-54).

Enter the time via the keyboard. For the time 0730, type 0, 7, 3, in the
scratchpad, and press PB #8. Colons and trailing zeros do not have to be
used; leading zeros are required.

The CC clock time is used for command speeds to achieve TOTs, IFF
phasing and ETAs. The CC battery keeps the time running with electrical
power removed from the aircraft. The CC time reads OFF at aircraft
start. Anytime power is interrupted to the CC, TIME OFF is displayed at
PB #8. Assuming a good CC battery, simply pressing PB #8 redisplays the
current time. Command speeds, IFF phasing and ETAs are only as
accurate as the CC clock time. Command speed, IFF phasing and ETA
computations will not be provided with CC clock time OFF.

Setting the Time of Day (after GPS)

With GPS, the aircrew can choose among totally GPS time, totally CC
clock time or a partial CC clock time that is completed by GPS. Total GPS
time is always ZULU; the aircrew can choose to use local hours with the
minutes/seconds filled in with GPS sourced time. With weight-on-wheels,
power up will initialize the clock to GPS time, if GPS time is valid. If GPS
time is invalid, the clock will initialize to CC clock time. If GPS time

The aircrew can use PB #8 to make partial time entries that will be
completed with GPS time (if GPS time is valid). The aircrew can also use
a complete time entry (hours, minutes, seconds), so that GPS time is
totally excluded. Lastly, by pressing PB #8 with a blank scratchpad, the

matrix with an egg crate barrier between the keys to minimize
inadvertent selection. For keys which are labeled with two characters or
functions, access the top letter or function by first pressing and releasing
the shift (SHF) key, then the desired key.

Keyboard lighting is controlled by the UFC knob on the interior lights
control panel on the right console in each cockpit.

Option Push Buttons (PBs)

The ten buttons allow data entry, power control, submenu access and
function selection. For reference, the buttons are numbered 1 through 10
counterclockwise, starting from the top left.

Data Entry: Pressing the appropriate button transfers data from the
scratchpad into the desired system. In some cases, if a system is off or
deactivated, it is simultaneously turned on/activated by the entry of
scratchpad data (LAW, TCN, IFF, AAI, ILS).

Power Control: Pressing the appropriate button turns the power on or off
to various systems. OFF follows the system legend if the system is
off/deactivated (Figure D-4, Left). System parameters follow the system
legend if the system is on/activated (Figure D-4, Right).

Submenu Access: With a clear scratchpad, pressing an option push button
calls up a submenu, where applicable.

Function Control: With a clear scratchpad, pressing an appropriate
system button selects or deselects a system function. Asterisks, as shown
in Figure D-4, indicate selection of modes or options.

UHF/Preset Channel Selector Knobs

UHF 1 and 2 are the only radios installed in the aircraft at this time. The
UHF 1 preset channel selector knob is on the left and the UHF 2 preset
channel selector knob is on the right (Figure D-5). These UHF channel
selectors incorporate a spring loaded push position that will be used to
select two additional communication systems to be added in the future,
radio 3 (R38) and radio 4 (R4). There is currently no way to select radio 4.
Pushing in on the radio 2/4 channel selector knob will turn radio 2 on.
Pushing in on the radio 1/3 channel selector knob will turn radio 1 on. If
radio 1 is already on, alternate depressions select radio 1 or 3. If the
legend at PB #5 is “JVC,” push the UHF 1/3 channel selector knob to
select UHF (vice JTIDS, which will be installed in radio 3).

With power removed from UHF 1 or UHF 2 (OFF), turning the
appropriate channel select knob powers the corresponding radio on and
selects the preset channel (vice manual) operating mode. Turning the
preset channel knob increments the channel (1-20, G).

UHF Volume Controls

As shown in Figure D-5, the volume control for UHF 1 (inner knob) is
located on the left side of the UFC and is labeled R1 (radio 1). The volume
control for UHF 2 (inner knob) is located on the right side of the UFC and
is labeled R2. R3 and R4 volume controls (the larger/outer knobs) are not
functional at this time.

When pressed, the EMIS LMT button (Figure D-6, top) stops all RF
transmissions from the aircraft (except for the radar altimeter and terrain
following radar). A caution/advisory light (Figure D-6, bottom) also
illuminates in both cockpits to alert the crew that the function has been
selected. When the button is pushed again, the EMIS LMT light is
extinguished and all affected systems are returned to their previously
selected state of operation. Either crew member can select or deselect this
function on the UFC.

Scratchpad

The scratchpad is the 10 character-wide area on the bottom line of the
UFC display, between UHF 1 and 2 radio preset channel data. As you
type on the keyboard, the characters appear on the scratchpad. After
confirming the data displayed in the scratchpad, enter the data by
pressing the button next to the appropriate system legend on the LCD.

If the scratchpad entry is invalid (more keyboard entries are performed
than can be displayed in the scratchpad, or the format of entries is
inappropriate for the system you attempt to interface with) the scratchpad
flashes. To clear the incorrect data, press the CLR key once to stop the
flashing, and then press CLR again to clear the last digit. One more press
clears the entire scratchpad. If the scratchpad is not flashing, the first
press of the CLR key clears the last character entered; the second press
clears the entire scratchpad.

Keyboard

The following terms are used throughout this workbook to describe how
keys and buttons operate.

Action Operating Definitions
Press Press and release a key or button.

Cycle Press a key or button to “toggle” between two
options.

Step Press a key or button to move in sequence
through several options.

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_15.jpeg:
On the UFC keyboard (Figure D-7), the alphanumeric keys allow entry of
numbers, upper case letters and symbols. For example:

A, B, C for route Alpha, Bravo (or Base Point or
Bullseye) and Charlie

N, 8, E, W for North, South, East and West

M for mark point selection

Do for decimal point, colon and dash
(Route and mark point selection will be covered in the INS lesson.)

AVI-03-07

Figure D - 7. UFC Keyboard.

The function keys surrounding the alphanumeric keys are used to provide
for selection, change and entry of various types of data.

GREC SHF and then GREC activates/deactivates the guard
receiver on the appropriate UHF radio. Separate
selections are provided for each UHF radio (left side UHF
1, right side UHF 2).

C/M key shifts between the preset channel and the manual
UHF frequency. Separate selections are provided for each
UHF radio (left side UHF 1, right side UHF 2). An
asterisk signifies which is currently selected, manual
frequency or preset channel.

MARK The MARK key inputs and stores the aircraft’s present
position latitude and longitude and the time of day the
mark was made. Up to ten mark points can be input and
stored for future reference.

D-9 AVI-3


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_16.jpeg:
DECIMAL (.) The decimal is used when entering some types of
navigation points. Decimals can be used, but are not
required for numerical entries (UHF frequencies, ILS
frequencies, latitude/longitude coordinates, etc).

A/P The A/P key is used to engage the autopilot.

CLR The CLR key clears the scratchpad or the display
rows. Successive activation will (in turn) stop the
scratchpad from flashing, or clear the last character,
clear the scratchpad, blank the top four rows of the
LCD, and blank all rows of the LCD.

DATA The DATA key selects the Data 1 display or
alternately cycles between the two data displays
(DATA 1/DATA 2).

MENU The MENU key selects the Menu 1 display or

alternately cycles between the two menu displays
(MENU 1/MENU 2).

SHF To select the upper functions of the alphanumeric
keys, press SHF before pressing the desired key. The
system then automatically returns to lower case
alphanumerics; therefore, pressing the keys SHF, A,
1, 2, 3, will produce A, 1, 2, 3 not A, A, N, B.

I/P Initiates IFF identification of present position (IFF
IDENT POSITION).
FCP/RCP Integration

If both crew members access the same system, the last input from either
UFC provides the controlling data input; otherwise, all data entries of one
UFC are independent of the other UFC. Data being keyed into one UFC
scratchpad is repeated on the other UFC scratchpad if that scratchpad is
clear. (Repeated data cannot be entered; that is, scratchpad data can only
be entered from the UFC on which it was keyed). As soon as you start to
key data, any previous information on the scratchpad keyed from the
other cockpit clears automatically. You can also clear repeated data from
your scratchpad with the CLR key.

UHF RADIOS

The UHF system consists of two separate receivers and transmitters
(UHF 1 and UHF 2) which operate on manually selected and preset
frequencies within the 225.000 to 399.975 MHZ frequency range.

Each UHF radio has a guard (243.0) receiver that can be activated
through the UFC when the radio is operating.

Both UHF radios have provisions for anti-jam communications (HAVE
QUICK) and secure communications (KY-58). These capabilities will be
addressed in more detail in a subsequent academic lesson.

The UHF radios are operated by controls located on the:

Remote intercommunication control panel (RICP)—FCP only
Intercommunication set control panel (ICSCP)—RCP only
Throttles

Floor buttons—RCP only

the best signal. The UHF 2 always transmits and receives on the
lower antenna.

Throttles

A three-position microphone switch is located on the inboard throttle in
each cockpit for UHF transmissions (Figure D-14). Pushing the switch
forward allows you to transmit on UHF 1; pulling the switch aft allows
you to transmit on UHF 2. The switch is spring loaded to the center

After power is applied to the aircraft (first generator on-line), the UFC
displays Menu 1. UHF 1 frequency information is located on the left two
bottom lines of the UFC, UHF 2 is on the right side. “OFF” is displayed at
PB #5/PB 46 if the respective radio is off. In Figure D-16, left, UHF 1 and
UHF 2 are turned off. In Figure D-16 (bottom), UHF 1 is turned on and
set to preset channel 2, as signified by the asterisk on the bottom line of

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_31.jpeg:
There are five ways to apply power to a UHF radio.

The first way is to press PB #5 (PB #6) (with the scratchpad clear) to
bring up the UHF 1 (UHF 2) submenu (Figure D-16, right). The
absence of an asterisk (*) adjacent to U1 (U2) on the submenu [and
“U1 OFF” (“U2 OFF”) next to PB #5 (PB #6) on all UFC formats]
signifies that the UHF 1 (UHF 2) radio is off. Pressing PB #1 (still
with a blank scratchpad) applies power to the appropriate UHF radio
and displays the asterisk symbol showing that the radio is on. The
last entered manual frequency appears at PB #5 (PB #6) and an
asterisk appears adjacent to the last selected frequency type (i.e.,
manual or preset), as shown in Figure D-16, bottom. The same
procedure is used to turn on UHF 2 using PB #6 on MENU 1 to
display the UHF 2 submenu. The UHF 1 and UHF 2 submenus are
identical except for PB #1 (U1 or U2) and UHF 2 submenu does not
display ADF at PB #2.

A second way to apply power to a UHF radio is to enter a valid
channel number in the scratchpad and press the appropriate channel
select knob. The radio comes on and tunes to the selected channel.

A third way to apply power to a UHF radio is to enter a valid manual
frequency in the scratchpad and press PB #5 (UHF 1) or PB #6 (UHF
2). The radio comes on and tunes to the selected manual frequency.

A fourth way to apply power to a UHF radio is to turn the
appropriate channel select knob. This turns the radio on, selects
channel mode and increments the channel number.

A fifth way to apply power to a UHF radio is to press the appropriate
channel select knob with an empty scratchpad. The radio comes on
and tunes to the previously selected preset channel.

The only way to turn a radio off is to select the appropriate UHF
submenu and press PB #1. This removes power from the radio, the
asterisk from PB #1 and the selected frequency type. “OFF” appears
at PB #5/PB #6, as appropriate.

Manual/Preset Frequency Selection

Refer to the left display example in Figure D-17, which depicts preset
channel 2 selected on UHF 1. To select the manual frequency, 226.125,
press the left C/M (channel/manual) key. The asterisk moves to the
manual frequency (Figure D-17, right).

To return to the UHF 1 preset frequency, press the left C/M key again.
The asterisk moves to the preset channel. The same logic applies to UHF
2, except the right C/M key is used.

The new frequency appears in the manual frequency readout and the
previous frequency readout (226.125) moves to the scratchpad. This
makes it easy to return to the previous frequency by pressing PB #5 or #6
as appropriate. Once you enter a manual frequency at PB #5 or #6, a
single press of the CLR button clears the scratchpad frequency.

Use of Decimal and Colons

Generally, entries which have a fixed number of digits (fixed field) do not
require the entry of decimals or colons. An example of a fixed field is the
UHF radio frequency, which always requires three nondecimal digits. In
this case, the decimal need not be entered; the UFC automatically
displays the decimal between the third and the fourth digit when the
scratchpad entry is identified as a radio frequency (i.e., when PB #5 or
PB 46 is pressed).

Time may be entered without entering the colon and is assumed to have
two hour digits (thus, when entering time, leading zeros are required).
Trailing zeros are automatically added to the field. Examples of how
entries are made are shown in the following:

FIELD FORMAT UFC ENTRY UFC DISPLAY

Time XX:XX:XX 1 10:00:00

UHF Submenu

The UHF 1 and UHF 2 submenus are accessed by pressing PB #5 (UHF 1)
or PB #6 (UHF 2) with an empty scratchpad. These submenus allow:

Turning radios on/off,
Programming the UHF preset frequencies (channels),
Selection of the ADF function (UHF 1 only),
Selection of the HAVE QUICK (anti-jam) and KY-58 (secure voice)
functions, and
e Selection of Both Transmit (Both TX).
Programming a UHF Preset Frequency (Channel)

Select the desired UHF submenu. In our example, PB #6 calls up the
UHF 2 submenu. Note that the current preset channel (10) appears at PB
#1 and its frequency (229.000) appears at PB #10. To change this
frequency to 314.65, enter 31465 in the scratchpad (Figure D-21). Press
PB #10, and the new frequency (314.65) for preset channel 10 is displayed.
When initially entering the UHF submenu the current preset frequency is
displayed next to PB #1. To change the frequency of another channel,
type the channel number into the scratchpad and enter it at PB #1. The

new channel's manual frequency is displayed next to PB #10 and can be
changed the same way as mentioned before. Note that the receiving and
transmitting channel has not been changed. This allows all other preset
channels to be changed while still monitoring the desired/assigned
channel, or all channels to be changed while monitoring a manual
frequency. Preset frequencies can be entered through a data transfer
module (DTM) or mission cartridge (MC).

Both TX (Both Transmit)

The capability exists to simultaneously transmit on two separate
frequencies. By selecting BOTH TX (PB #7) on either the UHF 1 or UHF
2 submenu, whenever transmission is attempted (with mic switch either
forward or aft, or RCP foot pedals), both radios transmit. This has certain
electronic protection (EP) benefits but can also cause embarrassment if
unknowingly selected. If BOTH TX is selected on either radio, an asterisk
appears next to PB #7 on both UHF submenus, indicating activation.

This should be checked during preflight ground ops. To deactivate, press
PB #7 (with a blank scratchpad). The asterisk disappears indicating
deactivation.

NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT
TACAN

The TACAN provides precise air-to-ground bearing and range information
to a maximum distance of approximately 300 miles (depending upon
aircraft altitude). It can also be operated in an air-to-air mode with
aircraft having similar equipment and provides line of sight distance
between two aircraft operating their TACAN sets 63 channels apart. Up
to five aircraft can determine their range from a sixth aircraft if their
TACAN sets are set 63 channels apart from that aircraft. Range is
limited to four times the distance between the lead aircraft and the
nearest aircraft. The sixth aircraft will be provided range from one of the
other aircraft, but cannot readily determine from which aircraft. A/A
TACAN information is normally limited to DME only; however, some
aircraft, such as the KC-10, can provide bearing also.

IFF/AAI SYSTEM

The F-15E IFF/AAT system directly interfaces with the UFC and includes
the IFF/SIF and air-to-air identification (AAI).

IFF

The identification system provides automatic identification when
challenged by a surface or airborne interrogator, as well as momentary
identification of aircraft position upon request. The IFF modes provided
are:

Mode 1 Mode 3 Mode C
Mode 2 Mode 4 A/B

Mode 4 is used for highest confidence identification (crypto), and Mode C
is used for altitude reporting.

Modes 1, 2, 3 and C are selected/deselected from the UFC. Mode 1 and
Mode 8 codes can be input from the UFC; Mode 2 codes are set from the
IFF transponder control box located in the aircraft nose (door 3R) and
cannot be altered in flight. Mode 4 is keyed by maintenance personnel.
Mode 4 controls are located on the RICP (FCP, left console) and the ICSCP
(RCP, left console).

which are selected from Menu 1. The IFF submenus are used to select
IFF modes and codes and to program IFF phasing (automatic timing).

Menu 1 provides initial IFF status and access to the IFF submenu. Modes
are displayed next to IFF anytime a mode is selected (activated) and
indicates that the IFF is being powered (Figure D-38). If Modes 1 through
3 and C are not activated (via the UFC), the Mode 4 selector switch is in

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_61.jpeg:
Activation or deactivation of modes (1, 2, 3, C) can be accomplished
through UFC Menu 1. Type the mode you wish to turn on/off in the
scratchpad and push PB #8. “3C” entry activates both Mode 3 and Mode
C. Ifthe mode was not displayed (off) prior to pushing PB #8, the mode is
activated (to the previously set code) and appears next to IFF along with
the other active modes. If the mode was displayed at PB #3 (on), the mode
is deactivated and the corresponding number/letter disappears. Mode 4
can only be activated/deactivated through the FCP RICP Mode 4 selector
switch.

The codes for Modes 1 and 3 may be changed (and the system turned on, if
off) directly from Menu 1 by typing in the mode, dash and code on the
keyboard (e.g., to change Mode 3 to 43821, press 3, SHF, -, 4, 3, 2, 1; verify
scratchpad entry; and press the IFF button). The entered mode and code
are displayed next to the IFF button for five seconds. The legend then
reverts to displaying the activated modes. The Mode 2 IFF code cannot be
changed from the cockpit. The Mode 4 codes (A or B) can only be selected
with the Mode 4 selector switch in the front cockpit. Mode 1 code entries
are limited to 0-7 for the first digit and 0-3 for the second digit; so the
lowest code is 00 and the highest is 73. Mode 3 code entries are limited to
0-7 for all digits; so the lowest valid code is 0000 and the highest is 7777.

The IFF submenu is selected by pressing the IFF button with a clear
scratchpad. The submenu allows access to the various functions (modes,
codes and programming) of IFF Modes 1, 2, 3 and C (Figure D-39). Mode
4 information is never displayed on the IFF submenu. Mode 4 control can
only be accomplished through the FCP RICP on the left console (Mode 4

Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_64.jpeg:
The IFF program submenu is used to program specific IFF modes and
codes to change as a function of time, which is referred to as “phasing”
(PH). Up to 18 different phases can be programmed. Only Modes 1, 2, 3
and C can be phased. Mode 4 must be changed manually on the FCP
RICP. Once activated, phasing is based on the CC/GPS clock time. As the
time passes the phase start time, the programmed modes and codes are
activated or deactivated automatically. Phasing is normally programmed
by the data transfer module (DTM); however, it can be manually
programmed or changed in the aircraft.

To enter the IFF phase programming submenu, press the PROGRAM
button. The asterisk adjacent to PROGRAM indicates that you are in the
IFF phase programming submenu. If IFF phases have been entered
either manually or by the DTM, a phase number appears next to PH at
PB #1. The selected modes, codes and time programmed for phase
number 1 are shown in Figure D-42, right.

press PB #1 or cycle PB #1 through the phases (previously programmed
phases only) in numerical order. If no phases are in the system, PB #1
will read “PH-0” and the legend will not cycle. If phases have been
entered, PB #1 will cycle through the existing phases. To program a
phase:

e Select the phase number. (Scratchpad entry only for initial
programming; scratchpad or cycling PB #1 for reprogramming a
phase already in CC memory).

e Ifyou wish a mode to be activated/deactivated for the phase, press
the desired MODE button, as required.

e Select a code for a mode by typing it on the scratchpad and pressing
the desired mode button. Note: even if a mode is not chosen for
activation, its code will change to whatever is shown on the
programming submenu (as a function of the phase time).

e To enter a phasing time, type the activation time on the keyboard

AAI

The aircraft’s Air-to-Air Interrogator (AAI) set provides A/A target
identification capabilities to assist the aircrew in accomplishing a variety
of tasks. The following discussion addresses AAI and Enhanced
Identification (EID) in only a basic fashion. A detailed discussion will be
addressed in a follow-on lesson in the air-to-air radar block of instruction.
The capabilities can be used to assist in:

e finding aircraft on the air-to-air radar.

e determining on the radar, which friendly aircraft is which.

e determining on the radar if an aircraft is friendly or hostile [based
on predetermined Rules of Engagement (ROE)/Positive
Identification (PID) criteria].

The interrogator set transmits challenge signals and receives target IFF
replies through the L-band antennas mounted on the main radar antenna.
The system evaluates the replies and generates display symbols
(diamonds or circles) on the A/A radar display (or the A/G radar display)
at the correct target range and azimuth position.

The UFC, in conjunction with HOTAS activation, provides the
mechanisms for controlling/implementing the interrogation. The radar
(both A/A and A/G) provides us information concerning the progress and
results of our interrogation. AAI interrogation can be interfaced from
UFC Menu 1 or from the AAI or EID UFC submenus.

The aircrew can make UFC selections, which determine how the AAI
interrogation will be implemented. Any combinations of Modes 1, 2, 3 and
4 can be interrogated with a single HOTAS switch action. Modes 1
through 3 can be interrogated such that replies to the mode (regardless of
code) are displayed (normal mode) or such that the interrogated
transponder must reply with both the correct mode and the correct code
(correct code mode). Mode 4 AAI always functions in the correct code
mode, with the code being A, B or both A and B.

UPFRONT CONTROL COMPONENT DESCRIPTION AND
FUNCTION

The upfront control (UFC) is the primary interface between the aircrew
and numerous aircraft avionics. It is powered up on engine start when
the first main generator comes on-line and remains operating as long as
either a main generator or the emergency generator (in AUTO or
MANUAL) is on-line.

Use of the UFC is integral to the operation of the aircraft equipment and
allows crew members to control the following systems:

UHF radios—including automatic direction finding (ADF), HAVE
QUICK (anti-jam feature) and KY-58 (secure voice feature)
functions

Inertial navigation system (INS) (most functions, including
present position coordinate entry and navigation point
entry/selection)

TACAN

ILS (instrument landing system)

NAV FLIR (navigation forward looking infrared)

IFF/SIF (identification friend or foe/selective identification
feature)

AAI (air-to-air interrogator) and EID (enhanced identification)
A/P (autopilot)

LAWS (low altitude warning system)

GCWS (ground collision warning system)

The above list is not all-inclusive. Other capabilities controlled through
the UFC will be covered in subsequent academic lessons.

D-1 AVI-3


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part1_page_8.jpeg:
The front cockpit UFC is located between the MPDs and above the MPCD,
so that it is easy to see and operate without looking down into the cockpit
(Figure D-1, left). The rear cockpit UFC is located on the right subpanel,
just to the right and forward of the right hand controller (Figure D-1,
right). Both UFCs are identical and all UFC functions are available to
either crew member.

LAWS

The LAWS is designed to warn you of descent below a predetermined
altitude above ground level (AGL). It uses the radar altimeter for altitude
measurement.

Control and display for the LAWS is provided on the UFC, Menu 1, PB #1
(Figure D-53). The system is alternately enabled (to the last selected
value) and disenabled by pressing PB #1 with an empty scratchpad.
Enabled status is indicated by the selected altitude replacing OFF at PB

scratchpad value enables the LAWS.

AVI-3 D-74


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part2_page_14.jpeg:
Warning Indications

In flight, if the actual aircraft AGL altitude goes below the LAWS
altitude, the LOW ALT warning lights and voice warning are activated.
The LAWS warnings are independent of the TF system. If the LAWS is
enabled on the ground, the LAWS does not provide the visual or aural
warnings until the aircraft climbs above the LAWS value and then
descends back down through the LAWS altitude. The LAWS warnings
also activate if the LAWS is enabled and the radar altimeter fails or if it
breaks track with aircraft parameters below 5000 feet (AGL), <60° roll
and <60° pitch.

The LAWS warnings (lights and voice) terminate if:
e The aircraft climbs at least 20 feet above the LAWS altitude.
e The LAWS function is turned off via the UFC.

e The LAWS altitude is changed to a value below the present aircraft
AGL altitude.

Ground Collision Warning System (GCWS)

The central computer (CC) utilizes aircraft inputs to provide visual and
aural warnings of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). It is a passive
system in that it provides no automatic recovery. Not all impending
CFITs produce a GCWS warning.

The CC uses inputs from the INS, ADC, FCC, ATUs, radar altimeter and
PACS to compute the altitude (AGL) to initiate the warnings. If OWOFF
or INVARM (stores identified on the PACS does not match aircraft-sensed
stores aboard) is displayed on the HUD, the GCWS is inoperative.

GCWS modes are aircrew selectable through UFC Menu 2 (Figure D-54).

used; leading zeros are required.

The CC clock time is used for command speeds to achieve TOTs, IFF
phasing and ETAs. The CC battery keeps the time running with electrical
power removed from the aircraft. The CC time reads OFF at aircraft
start. Anytime power is interrupted to the CC, TIME OFF is displayed at
PB #8. Assuming a good CC battery, simply pressing PB #8 redisplays the
current time. Command speeds, IFF phasing and ETAs are only as
accurate as the CC clock time. Command speed, IFF phasing and ETA
computations will not be provided with CC clock time OFF.

Setting the Time of Day (after GPS)

With GPS, the aircrew can choose among totally GPS time, totally CC
clock time or a partial CC clock time that is completed by GPS. Total GPS
time is always ZULU; the aircrew can choose to use local hours with the
minutes/seconds filled in with GPS sourced time. With weight-on-wheels,
power up will initialize the clock to GPS time, if GPS time is valid. If GPS
time is invalid, the clock will initialize to CC clock time. If GPS time

conjunction with a mode or mode/code change (from Menu 1), or in
conjunction with a code change from the AAI submenu. The “N” indicates
that correct mode replies will be shown on the radar. The “C” indicates
that only replies with the correct code will be shown on the radar for that
mode.

Interrogation

The legend in the lower left corner (Figure D-47) of the A/A radar cycles
through each selected mode/master mode (AAI 1N, AAT 2C, AAT 3N, etc.)
as each is interrogated. Diamonds (Modes 1, 2 and 3 reply or low
confidence Mode 4 reply) or circles (high confidence Mode 4 reply) are
displayed at the correct azimuth and range on the radar. At PB #8
(AAT/EID) on the UFC Menu 1, the modes, codes and master modes (C or
N) will cycle through as they are interrogated. Once the interrogation is
complete both the radar and UFC Menu 1 return to normal format.

The EID submenu allows AAI selections totally independent of the AAI
submenu. It is mechanized almost exactly like the AAI submenu, except
changes to the EID selections cannot be implemented from UFC Menu 1.
The legends on UFC Menu 1 showing selected modes and showing the
progress of an interrogation, as well as the A/A radar cues showing the
progress/results of an interrogation are the same as for AAI, except
information is prefaced by “EID” vice “AAI.” The HOTAS switchology is
the same, except the FCP coolie is moved inboard (vice outboard for AAT)
and the RCP interrogate switch is moved aft (vice forward for AAI). The
significance of PB #8 (“MX 2”) will be addressed at a later time.

D - 67 AVI-3


Text from AVI-3_Upfront_Control_Part2_page_7.jpeg:
Obviously, the capability to program two separate interrogation sequences
on the AAI/EID submenus provides a great deal of flexibility. The
optimum way to use the capability is totally situation dependent. Another
lesson, in the A/A radar block of instruction, will further address AAI/EID.
For now, consider the following examples.

AVI-3

You are flying night trail formation beyond visual range of your
leader. You have programmed the AAI submenu to interrogate
your leader’s discrete Mode 1 code (M1-11C) and the EID submenu
to interrogate for VFR traffic (M3-1200C).

You are flying a combat mission escorting a strike package. You
have programmed the AAI submenu to interrogate the strike
package’s discrete mode (M2-7777C) and the EID submenu to fulfill
the ROE to discriminate enemy aircraft—absence of Mode 4A and
absence of Mode 1 (M4A and M1-11N).

You are flying a low level training mission, and for see-and-avoid
you want to interrogate for both VFR civilian traffic (M3-1200) and
VFR military special use airspace traffic (M3-4000). You program
M8-1200C on the AAI submenu and M38-4000C on the AAT
submenu. You use correct code because you do not want to see
replies from IFR traffic squawking Mode 3.

Figure D - 3. ADI Symbology (Continued).

Heading Scale and Heading Indicator: The caret on the heading scale
indicates the current heading. If heading information is invalid, OFF is
written above the heading scale and the heading numbers are removed.
Heading information always comes from the INS unless an INS error is
detected, then the CC will use AHRS (EGI after TCTO 1F-15E-737)
heading.

True Airspeed or Ground Speed: True airspeed or ground speed is
displayed below the angle of attack/command velocity, when selected on
the UFC Data 1 format. If neither true airspeed or ground speed is
selected, the space is blank. If either true airspeed or ground speed is
selected but invalid, it is displayed as T OFF or G OFF.

AVI-4 D-4


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_11.jpeg:
Bank Steering Bar: The bank steering bar provides command steering
information to intercept TACAN/ILS courses (set on the HSI), to steer
direct to navigation steer points, or to fly the ground track course on the
HSI. The function of the bank steering bar is dependent on the steer
mode selected on the HSI.

Pitch Steering Bar: A pitch steering bar appears when the aircraft
captures the glide slope (ILST or ILSN steer mode selected on the HSI).
The ILS pitch steering bar commands a 3° glide slope.

Radar Altimeter Thermometer/Scale: The analog radar altimeter
thermometer/scale is displayed in all master modes whenever the radar
altimeter is operating and the terrain following (TF) system is ON. The
thermometer is never displayed on the ADI during non-TF operations or
during TF operations with radar altimeter in OVERRIDE. During normal
TF operations it is displayed regardless of aircraft altitude (it is not
removed when the aircraft altitude is above 1500 feet AGL).

Attitude Sphere: The attitude sphere depicts the aircraft in relation to the
horizon. On a MPD, the ground is displayed as thick, closely spaced
horizontal lines while the sky is clear. On a MPCD the sky is blue and the
ground is brown lines.

Note: When the pitch attitude meets or exceeds +30°, the horizon line is
not visible and the sphere is all one color.

Radar Altitude: Radar altitude is displayed below the baro altitude (below
vertical velocity, if displayed) only if it is selected on the UFC Data 1
format. If radar altitude is invalid (and selected for display), it is
displayed as R OFF.

Vertical Velocity: Vertical velocity is shown under the barometric altitude
readout when the landing gear handle is down. It is displayed as feet per
minute, prefaced with a (+) for climbing or a (-) for descending. If invalid,
it is displayed as VV OFF. This space is blank when the gear handle is

up.

Baro Altitude: Barometric altitude is always displayed in the altitude
window (box). At 1000 feet MSL and above, the last three digits are small
and the preceding digits are large. Below 1000 feet, all three digits are
large. If the barometric altitude is invalid, OFF is displayed in the box.

D-5 AVI-4


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_12.jpeg:
Command Heading Bug and Digital Readout: The command heading bug
(Figure D-4) indicates the heading to the next navigation sequence point if
NAV is the steer mode selected on the HSI. If ILST, ILSN, TCN, or HDG
is the steer mode selected on the HSI, the command heading bug is slaved
to the heading set on the HSI. If GT is the HSI-selected steer mode, the
bug provides a command heading to fly the HSI-set ground track. If it is
beyond the range of the scale, the bug is pegged at the appropriate edge
(left or right) with a digital readout beneath it.

Command velocity and the associated sequence point (Figure D-4) are
displayed (if valid and landing gear handle is up) when a time on target
(TOT) is assigned to a specific sequence point. This is the speed necessary
to reach the given sequence point at the TOT. The information displayed
is for the next sequence point (on the current route) that has a TOT
assigned.

Standby Instruments

Conventional instruments are located in both cockpits on the main
instrument panel (Figures D-6 and D-7). The angle of attack indicator
and the vertical velocity indicator require main generator power. The
airspeed indicator and altimeter do not require any power. All other
standby instruments function off main generator or emergency generator
power (auto or manual) except for the standby compass, which requires no
power. Lighting for all standby instruments requires main generator
power.

Standby Airspeed Indicator - Front and Rear Cockpits

The standby airspeed indicator operates directly from pitot-static
pressures. It consists of a rotation pointer on a fixed scale with marks
from 60 to 850 knots.

AVI-4 D-10


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_17.jpeg:
Standby Attitude Indicator (ADI) - Front and Rear Cockpits

The ADI is a self-contained, electrically driven gyro-horizon instrument.
The gyro is caged by pulling the knob. Power should be applied to the
instrument for at least 1 minute before caging. The caged position is
approximately 4° nose up from the normal ground attitude and the gyro
will precess 4° nose down after uncaging. Do not turn the knob to lock the
gyro in the caged position. The gyro cages to the aircraft longitudinal axis
(wingline) and not to level flight (horizon), regardless of actual aircraft
attitudes. An OFF flag appears if there is a power loss to the indicator or
the gyro is caged.

Standby Altimeter - Front and Rear Cockpits

The altimeter operates directly from a static pressure source. Only the
setting on the FCP standby altimeter sets the barometric pressure for the
air data computer (ADC). This baro altitude is then used by other aircraft
systems, including the HUD and ADI displayed barometric altitude.

Vertical Velocity Indicator (VVI) - Front and Rear Cockpits

The VVI operates by electrical signals from the air data computer.
It displays vertical velocity on a 0 to 6000 feet per minute scale. An OFF
flag appears if electrical power is lost or the display is not valid.

Crew Coordination: As changes made to the HSI display in either cockpit
affect both cockpits, crew coordination may be required.

AVI-4 D-16


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_23.jpeg:
Range Scale: The HSI displays five range scales (10, 20, 40, 80, and

160 nm) at the top right corner under RNG. The range is the distance
from the aircraft symbol to the perimeter of the compass card. Increase or
decrease the range by pressing PB #16 or #17, respectively. The distances
to the navigation position and TACAN station symbols within the compass
card are to scale. This is provided for ease of HSI interpretation.

The Lubber Line: The compass card rotates so that the aircraft heading is
always under the top of the lubber line.

TACAN and NAV Data: The TACAN data block (on the left) and the NAV
data block (on the right) are green and blue, respectively, on a MPCD.

The TACAN data block provides bearing and distance, and estimated time
en route (only) to the selected TACAN station. The NAV data block
provides bearing, distance, and estimated time en route (ETE) or
estimated time of arrival (ETA) information to the current navigation
steer point. If ETE is displayed on the UFC Data 1 page at PB #2

(Figure D-11), then ETA is displayed on the HUD and HSI NAV data
blocks. If ETA is displayed on the UFC, ETE is displayed on the HUD and
HSI NAV data blocks. Toggling the PB alternately selects ETE/ETA.

Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_24.jpeg:
Heading Marker and Command Heading: The heading marker (captain’s
bars) is moved around the compass card by means of the command
heading selections when HDG, ALG, TCN, ILSN, or ILST is the selected
steer mode. Command heading is increased or decreased by pressing

PB #1 or #2. The heading changes by 1° per push or 10° per second if the
button is held depressed. Additionally, you may enter a desired heading
into the UFC scratchpad and depress either button to transfer that
heading to the HSI command heading readout. In the NAV mode, the
heading marker is slaved to the wind-corrected heading to fly to the
selected steer point, so it may differ from the heading under the NAV
bearing pointer and the bearing in the NAV data block. In the GT mode,
the heading marker is slaved to the command heading to fly the selected
ground track.

Bearing Pointers: There are two bearing pointers. The NAV bearing
pointer, a hollow arrow with a hollow tail, is blue on a MPCD. The
TACAN bearing pointer, an arrowhead with a solid tail, is green.

ADF Symbol: A small lollipop symbol is displayed only when the ADF is
selected. It indicates the bearing of a transmitted UHF signal. ADF is
activated from the UFC UHF 1 submenu.

Navigation/Steering Modes

There are eight steering modes listed on the HSI display. They are TCN,
CRS, ILST, ILSN, GT, NAV, ALG, and HDG, and are selected by pressing
the desired mode pushbuttons. The mode selected becomes boxed.

TACAN (TCN

Selected Course: The selected course is displayed at the top right side of
the HSI (Figure D-12). PB #15 increases the course and PB #14 decreases
it. The desired course can also be input by typing it into the UFC
scratchpad and pressing either button.

Course (CRS)

This steer mode is equivalent to the existing TACAN steer mode, except
that the radial will be calculated to a steer point rather than a TACAN
station. In CRS steer mode, the range and bearing to the selected CRS
radial will be calculated. CRS steer mode will have the same display
options and features as TCN steer mode, including PLAN and CDI views.
PB #6 on the electronic horizontal situation indicator (EHSI) will default
to TCN at power up. Depression of PB #6 will box the selection at PB #6
(initially TCN). Subsequent depressions of PB #6 will toggle between
TCN and CRS. Another steer mode must be selected in order to unbox the

the HSI. (The data block on the HUD will be different.) The course
deviation scale is 1.25° per dot. Full deflection represents 2.5° or greater
deviation. If the autopilot is engaged or the TFR is on, ILS is not a

Ground Track (GT)

The heading marker (captain’s bars) and CMD HDG readout are slaved to
the command heading required to maintain the selected ground track
(Figure D-16). Use PBs #14 and #15 to select the desired ground track.
The ground track diamond shows current aircraft ground track.

Figure D-17 shows a heading of 350° to maintain a ground track of 355°.
If crosswinds increase or decrease, the heading marker adjusts to the
heading necessary to maintain the ground track of 355°. If there is no
drift, the ground track diamond aligns with the lubber line. In that case,
the heading marker, lubber line, and ground track diamond would be
aligned and the CMD HDG readout and selected ground track would read
the same.

TACAN/NAV data blocks and bearing pointers are available in all HSI
steer modes.

Navigation (NAV)

Selecting NAV moves the command heading marker and CMD HDG
readout to highlight the wind-corrected heading to the selected steer
point. Both agree with the bearing in the NAV data block (no wind), or
differ from it by the amount of drift present (Figure D-18). The command
heading is shown at the top left side of the display. Aircraft course
(ground track) is shown at the top right of the display and agrees with the
ground track diamond (both change as the aircraft current
heading/ground track changes).

The legend “AUTO SEQ” is displayed below PB #18 and is boxed when
auto sequencing is enabled. Auto sequencing means that as the aircraft
passes the current navigation point (within 2 nm), the next navigation
point on the route automatically becomes the “new” current navigation
point and aircraft steering then transitions to the “new” point. AUTO
SEQ can be selected/deselected in any HSI steering mode.

Autonomous Landing Guidance (ALG)

The ALG mode provides an independent capability for approaches and
landings at any location. “ILS-like” steering cues are provided to a
designated point on the ground via a selected course and a computed 3°
glide slope. Deviations from the selected course and glide path are
displayed to the aircrew on the ADI, HSI, and HUD. From the NAV or
INST master mode, ALG (PB #5) is selected on the HSI (Figure D-19).

The aircrew then designates the ALG point, the intended touchdown
point, via A/G radar, target IR, HUD designation, or NAV designation.
Designations are covered in a later lesson. An inbound course is set at

PB #14 and the ALG algorithm plots a position 10 nm from the designated
point and marks it as the final approach fix (FAF). A rectangular runway
symbol, a tick mark to represent the FAF, and a final approach arrow will
be displayed on the HSI if PLAN is selected at PB #20. After the aircraft
reaches the FAF, the system will provide guidance to the runway based on
the specific course. Detailed information on the ALG mode is contained in
TO 1F-15E-1 and the system will be discussed further in A/G academics.

HUD
Function and Description

The wide field of view head-up display (WFOV HUD), 21° x 28°, provides
basic navigation, flight control, and weapons delivery information. A
difference from earlier F-15 HUD models is that airspeed and altitude

appear in digital formats. The displayed information generally matches
that on the ADI.

AVI-4 B-1


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_40.jpeg:
Heading Scale: The heading scale presents a 30° readout across the top of
the display. The stationary heading caret indicates the aircraft magnetic
heading. If heading information is invalid, the numbers are removed and
OFF is displayed above the heading scale. Heading information always
comes from the INS unless it is determined to be invalid, in which case it
automatically switches to AHRS.

Command Heading/Steering Bug: The bug mirrors the command heading
on the HSI, if it is within the 30° scale. If not within the 30° heading
scale, it pegs on the appropriate side and a digital heading readout
appears below the bug. The command heading is aircrew selectable in the
TCN, ILS, and HDG steer modes. It is slaved to the computed heading to
fly to the current NAV steer point or to fly the selected ground track in the
GT steer mode, respectively (selections made from the HSI).

Airspeed: Calibrated airspeed is displayed in the box if valid. If invalid,
OFF is displayed.

AOA: The angle of attack data is displayed regardless of landing gear
handle position. If invalid, it is removed.

True Airspeed or Ground Speed: True airspeed or ground speed is
displayed if selected on UFC Data 1, and is prefaced by T or G, as
appropriate. T OFF or G OFF is displayed if selected but invalid.

Steering Bar: The steering bar gives bank steering to the selected
TCN/ILS course, the selected heading in the HDG steer mode, or the
current navigation steer point in the NAV steer mode. In GT steer mode
it provides bank steering to the HSI-programmed ground track. If
information is invalid, it is removed.

In Command Cue: Indicates the front cockpit is in command of the HUD.
Taking command of the HUD is required for certain updates/
designations, air-to-ground operations, and FLIR boresighting.

Mach Number: Current aircraft Mach, computed by the CC from ADC
inputs, is displayed when landing gear handle is up. Invalid information
is removed.

G Data: Current G is on the left and maximum allowable G is on the
right. G data disappears when the gear handle is down. Current G
followed by OWOFF (e.g., 2.2 G OWOFF) is displayed if maximum
allowable G is invalid. OWOFF is displayed if both current and maximum
allowable G are invalid.

AVI-4 D - 34


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_41.jpeg:
Bank Angle Scale: The bank scale at the bottom of the HUD is graduated
with markings at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60°. If invalid, it is removed.

Pitch Ladder: The pitch ladder consists of the horizon bar and pitch lines.
Pitch lines are solid above the horizon bar and dashed below. Tabs at the
end of each line point toward the horizon. The pitch lines are numbered
in 5° increments up to 85° of pitch. They slant toward the horizon in the
center at one-half the pitch angle they represent (i.e., the 10° pitch line
slants 5° toward the horizon).

Normally, the pitch ladder is referenced to the velocity vector in both
azimuth and elevation. When the velocity vector becomes “pitch HUD
limited,” the pitch ladder will always be referenced to the valid velocity
vector while maintaining the artificial horizon on the horizon. If the
velocity vector is not displayed, the pitch ladder transitions to the aircraft
waterline in azimuth and displays best available pitch referenced to the
horizon. This transition may take up to 2 seconds, and is referenced for
pitch attitude only, not flight path. When the velocity vector reappears,
the pitch ladder transitions back to the velocity vector and references
flight path information once again.

Data Block: The data block displays data pertinent to the steer mode
selections made on the HSI. Upon selection of TCN, CRS, ILST, or ILSN,
“CSET XXX” flashes below ETE/A in the data block to remind the aircrew
to set the appropriate course. The cue is removed after 10 seconds. If
information is invalid, OFF is displayed on the appropriate line of the
data block. When CRS is the selected steer mode, CRS XX.XXX will be
displayed on the HUD, where XX.XXX designates the current steer-to
point. In addition, the NAV range to the selected steer point will be
displayed in nautical miles, along with time to go. CRS steer mode can be
autopilot coupled and ACRS XX.XXX is displayed. If the autopilot is
coupled, ANAV, ATCN, ACRS, AGT, or AHDG engaged cues will be
shown. If time is invalid, “OFFE” or “OFFA” is displayed.

Altitude: Barometric altitude is always displayed. If invalid, OFF is
displayed in the box. Radar altitude is displayed below the altitude box, if
selected on UFC Data 1. If invalid, it is displayed as R OFF.

Waterline Symbol: The waterline symbol displays aircraft pitch attitude.
The symbol flashes at 13° nose high, as a tail scrape warning cue, during
landing/aerobraking.

D - 35 AVI-4


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_42.jpeg:
Velocity Vector (VV): This displays the instantaneous aircraft flight path
with respect to earth coordinates. The vertical relationship between the
waterline symbol and the velocity vector indicates true AOA. The VV
symbol is limited to 8.5° radius of motion centered on the HUD field of
view. It flashes when it reaches the limits of motion (due to wind
drift/crab). If in the instrument (INST) or navigation (NAV) master mode,
the VV may be caged to permit velocity vector referenced information
(pitch ladder and pitch/bank steering bars) to stay near the center of the
HUD when large yaw/crosswind angles exist. Take command of the HUD
and press the laser fire button (FCP only) on the throttle to cage the VV
and permit the pitch ladder and pitch/bank steering bars to be retained
near the center of the HUD. The velocity vector flashes when caged. A
subsequent laser fire button depression frees the symbol in drift.

NOTE: If the FNU INS fails, the velocity vector on the HUD will flash
continually. The EGI will drive the velocity vector in EGI PPKS. In all
other PPKS selections, the velocity vector will be driven by the air data
processor (ADP) as long as the airspeed exceeds 80 kts. When the
airspeed is less than 80 kts and the velocity vector is being driven by the
ADP, it will not be displayed.

Ghost Velocity Vector: When the VV is caged, a ghost vector (Figure D-26)
is displayed to show actual flight path. It looks like a velocity vector
without the interior circle. The vector flashes when within 1.5° of the
HUD edge.

Command Velocity Wiper: The command velocity wiper is displayed to
the left of the calibrated airspeed readout to indicate a difference between
current aircraft speed and command velocity when a TOT is programmed.
The symbol rotates up and down where 1° represents one knot of velocity.
A positive angle signifies more velocity is needed. The command velocity
is based on ground speed or true airspeed if selected on the UFC;
otherwise command velocity is based on calibrated airspeed.

Target Designation (TD) Box/Electronic Identification (EID): With an
air-to-air radar lock on, the TD box is displayed on the HUD in the A/A,
NAV, or INST master mode. If applicable, an EID cue is displayed inside
the TD box.

Line of Sight (LOS) Cue: The function of the LOS cue is to highlight the
position of the current navigation steer point when the point is located
within the HUD FOV.

Radar Altimeter Thermometer/Scale: The analog radar altimeter
thermometer/scale is displayed in all master modes whenever the radar
altimeter is powered and the radar altitude is less than or equal to 1500
feet AGL. The thermometer and scale are automatically removed when
the aircraft altitude is greater than 1800 feet AGL for more than 3
seconds and is displayed upon descent through 1500 feet AGL.

Gear Down Display

When the gear handle is down, HUD symbols (airspeed, AOA, altitude,
bank scale, etc.) are lowered to reduce pilot look angles between the
velocity vector and the symbols (Figure D-26). Mach and G data
disappear. Vertical velocity (VV) appears under the altitude window.
AOA continues to be displayed under the airspeed window.

HUD Repeater

The HUD repeater can be selected for display on any MPD/MPCD

(Figure D-27). To get NAV FLIR video, press PB #20 (N-F). To view HUD
camera video, press PB #16 (CAM). Figure D-26 shows a HUD display
with CAM selected. If neither video selection is made, the only display is
that of data and symbology (e.g., no “real world” camera or NAV FLIR
video). This is accomplished by pressing the boxed selection (“unboxing”
it).

The four pushbuttons at the bottom of the HUD control panel

(Figure D-28) are used to select the desired master modes - A/A, A/G,
NAV, and INST. In this lesson, the focus is on the NAV and INST master

modes.

NAV or INST Master Modes

Both modes give similar flight information. The navigation data
(command heading bug, pitch/bank steering bars, CDI, and data block)
changes according to the steer mode selected on the HSI. The HSI steer
mode is mirrored in the HUD.

Upon selecting the TCN, CRS, ILST, or ILSN steer modes, “CSET” and

the current course set value appear (flashing) for 10 seconds following
steer mode selection.

STUDENT PREPARATION REQUIREMENTS

PRIOR TO THE CBT LESSON

1. Study the information contained in this workbook and complete the
End of Text Quiz.

2. Read references in Sections I and II of TO 1F-15E-1.

NOTE: This workbook includes references to TCTO 1F-15E-737
addressing global positioning system (GPS) aircraft modification data.
This capability is required to support the replacement of the TACAN,
VOR, and DME systems. The equipment is an embedded GPS/INS
system which combines both a GPS receiver and processor and an
independent ring laser gyro (RLG) INS into a single box that replaces the
attitude heading reference set (AHRS) and is called the EGI INS. The
existing INS is called the fighter navigation unit (FNU) INS. The EGI
provides a blended solution which optimizes navigation capability and
provides very accurate position and velocity data.

For this block of training, the most significant factor is that a new flight
director steer mode called course steering (CRS STR) has been added.
This steer mode is equivalent to the existing TACAN steer mode, except
that the course will be calculated to a steer point rather than a TACAN
station. It will have the same display options and features as TCN steer
mode, including PLAN and CDI views.

This workbook shows both existing and post-EGI/INS explanations.

C-1 AVI-4


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_50.jpeg:
ILST Steer Mode Data

When the ILST steer mode is selected on the HSI, the HUD data block
displays ILST and the selected TACAN channel and mode, TACAN range,
and ETE to the TACAN station (Figure D-32). MKR flashes below the
time when passing over the marker beacon cone.

The pitch and bank steering bars provide pitch and bank steering to
intercept the localizer course and glide path referenced to the velocity
vector. The course arrow displays localizer deviation with a full scale
deflection indicating 2.5° or greater (1.25° per dot).

The glide path indicator caret on the HUD, adjacent to the glide path
scale, functions the same as on the ADI. The command heading bug
reflects the command heading set on the HSI.

NOTE: The ILS pitch steering bar is optimized for a 3° glideslope. If
flying a 2.5° glideslope, the pitch steering bar positions the aircraft about
% dot below glideslope at decision height. The ILS steering adjusts its
commands based on the elapsed time since glideslope capture. This
results in smaller correction commands as the aircraft gets closer to the
runway where the steering sensitivity increases. If the glideslope is
captured late or if there is any interruption of ILS validity after glideslope
capture, the steering may overcorrect and cause vertical and lateral
excursions during the approach.

ILSN Steer Mode

Selecting ILSN on the HSI provides information similar to ILST except
that NAV range and time are displayed instead of TACAN data

(Figure D-33). In the HUD data block, ILSN steer mode, distance, and
estimated time en route (E) or estimated time of arrival (A) are presented.
Glide path information and steering to the ILS localizer remains the same
as ILST. In the ILS modes, vertical and lateral steering information is
provided by the ILS. Range information is provided by the INS or MN
(ILSN), or the TACAN (ILST).

WARNING

HUD ILS command guidance is
mechanized for a 3° glideslope. If other

The aircrew can also program the HUD symbology independent of the
master mode and reject level selected on the HUD control panel. This
allows either crew member to change the HUD programming options in
flight without affecting the current master mode and HUD symbology.
Pressing PB #13 toggles to the next reject level and PB #14 toggles to the
next master mode.

There are several exceptions to the HUD display programming. They are:

1.

If the TFR is on, the radar altimeter thermometer and bank
angle scale are always displayed. The radar altimeter
thermometer is displayed only if allowed by altitude restrictions.

The bank angle scale is automatically displayed upon initial
activation of the TFR, whether programmed or not. It may,
however, be rejected in all of the master modes if TFR is in OFF
or STBY.

The bank steering bar will not be rejected when ILST or ILSN is
selected on the HSI.

The pilot can display the steer mode as range data, even if NAV
data has been programmed for removal, by moving the throttle
coolie switch outboard.

OWOFF is automatically displayed anytime an invalid
maximum G condition occurs.

A list of the symbols displayed with default selected is shown in master
mode HUD programming tables in TO 1F-15E-1. The aircrew can select
default on the HUD repeater to obtain the default HUD, “canned”
symbology. Alternatively, the pilot can select NORM on the HUD control
panel reject switch and achieve the “manufacturer’s standard” HUD
symbology.

HUD Degrades/Failures and Interfaces

The CC commands the displays on the HUD through various controls and
generating interfaces. If the source of a display is sensed to be in a
degraded or failed mode (including OFF in most cases), the appropriate
invalid cue is commanded for that display data. Generally “OFF” is
displayed in place of the data, if it is invalid. Alternately, the data is
removed (command heading, CDI, pitch/bank steering bars). If the CC
fails and the MPDP has taken control, the HUD is in the backup mode.
The HUD display appears in the gear up position even with gear down.
The INS provides pitch and bank data and radar provides altitude. The
HUD format is only displayed on the HUD (no repeater display).
Degraded avionics in a later lesson addresses this subject in more detail.

ADI DISPLAY
Function and Description

The ADI (Figure D-1) provides basic attitude, heading, and airspeed
information. It can be displayed on any MPD/MPCD. The ADI
continuously displays calibrated airspeed, barometric altitude, magnetic
heading, and the current attitude source. In addition, pitch and bank
steering information (driven by signals from the CC) is displayed
referenced to the steering mode selection on the HSI. The ADI is also the
only source for turn and slip information.

Calibrated Airspeed: The box always displays calibrated airspeed (or OFF
if calibrated airspeed is invalid).

Angle of Attack/Command Velocity: Angle of attack is displayed when the
landing gear is down. Command velocity is displayed when the landing
gear is up. The command velocity is normally in calibrated airspeed. If
true airspeed or ground speed is selected for display on UFC Data 1, the
command velocity is based on that speed. The navigation point/TOT on
which the command velocity is based is displayed after the command
velocity. If no TOT has been entered, command velocity is not displayed
and this space is blank.

Waterline Pitch Trim: Waterline pitch trim allows the adjustment of the
attitude sphere reference to the miniature aircraft symbol. Setting either
cockpit pitch trim for changing airspeeds/AOA sets the pitch reference in
both cockpits.

AVI-4 D-2


Text from AVI-4_ADI_HSI__HUD_page_9.jpeg:
Current Attitude Source (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737): The current attitude
source shows INS or AHRS. On power up, the source is AHRS until the
INS is aligned and NAV is selected on the INS control knob. Thereafter,
the source is INS unless the INS attitude is invalid; then the source will
default to AHRS. INS or AHRS can be manually selected by pressing

PB #5. Manually changing the attitude source has no effect on the
heading information source. If the current attitude source (displayed) is
invalid, OFF appears below the source legend and a large “X” is displayed
across the attitude sphere.

Current Attitude Source (After TCTO 1F-15E-737): Upon the installation
of GPS hardware, the AHRS is removed from the aircraft and the
selectable attitude references become EGI or (FNU) INS. The aircraft
central computer will determine whether the GPS hardware is installed
and hence determines the available selections at PB #5 (EGI/INS or
INS/AHRS). Ifthe selected source becomes invalid, the system should
default to the opposite source. In any case, if the selected source is
invalid, a large X will be displayed across the EADI, prompting the
aircrew to select the other attitude source. The INS is the power up
default source.

Flight Path Symbol: The velocity vector (bow tie) represents the flight
path vector with respect to pitch only.

Bank Scale and Pointer: The bank scale markings are in graduations at
10, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90°. The pointer reflects actual bank angle. A scale
modification at 0, 45, and 60° clarifies bank limitations during terrain
following (TF) operation.

Slip Indicator, Turn Rate Scale and Indicator: The turn rate and slip rate
indicators are electronically displayed and electrically powered. If invalid,
OFF is displayed adjacent to the applicable indicator.

Miniature Aircraft: The miniature aircraft reflects actual aircraft attitude
in relation to the attitude sphere.

Pitch Scale: The pitch scale markings are in graduations of 5°, with each
10° increment numbered with the pitch angle.

New Total Fuel Weights

At engine start, the CC does not immediately initialize the OWS to the
new total fuel weight. Rather, it starts at the previously stored shutdown
fuel weight and adds fuel at a rate of 40 pounds per second until reaching
the new fuel weight as displayed on the fuel quantity gauge. Depending
upon the amount of fuel at shutdown, the update process may take up to
10 minutes. During this time, the OWS indicates that it is operational,
but the maximum allowable G is not accurate.

NOTE

Whenever fuel quantity changes exceed the 40 pounds per second rate, (e.g.,
air refueling, high fuel consumption, tank jettison or ground refueling) the

OWS will be unreliable until computations catch up with the actual fuel
quantity.

AVI-5 D-4


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_11.jpeg:
The correct fuel weight input to the OWS can be confirmed while
performing a BIT check of an MPD/MPCD during ground operations
(Figure D-3). From the main menu, press PB #20, BIT. On the BIT

display, press PB #18, MAINT. Then press PB #1, DSPL/UFC/EMD.

Referring to Figure D-12:

Row 1 of the OWS matrix display shows worst case overload data from
each column. The 103 (10.3 G) displayed in the ACC column shows the
highest G recorded, up to 12 Gs. Negative G forces, up to -4 Gs, are
displayed. Row 1 also indicates a 129% overload (OVL column). The
severity code 3 under WNG, row 1, is the highest listed in the WNG
column.

AVI-5 D-14


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_21.jpeg:
Row 2 of the display shows latest overload data. In the figure, 7.8 G
resulted in a 105% overload of the computed maximum allowable G for the
wing. The severity code is 1 (severity codes listed in Figure D-12).

Rows 3-23 provide data for components. Three rows are assigned to each
component (i.e., FUS rows 3-5; WNG rows 6-8; etc.). If no recordable
overloads occur for a component, the rows are blank. If more than three
overload conditions have occurred for a component, only the three worst
conditions are displayed. Rows 6-8 indicate at least three overloads have
occurred on the wings; rows 9-11 indicate only two overloads have been
recorded for the left tail boom section. A severity code of 0 (WNG)
indicates that the load factor experienced was recordable but 100% or less
(>85%). An overload of 100.01 percent will cause the OVL to read 101 and
a severity code of 1 to be displayed.

Min/Max G is displayed in the lower right corner of the OWS display.
This readout reflects the lowest and highest G for the current mission.
Min/Max G are reset to 1 G during INS alignment and/or during OWS
reset (ASP reset).

D-15 AVL-5


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_22.jpeg:
Clearing Overloads

If all the recorded overloads are 100% or less, they are cleared
automatically during INS alignment (when the INS mode knob is placed
to NAV). Any overload(s) exceeding 100% must be manually cleared,
which requires a coordinated air/ground crew action (Figure D-13). Either
aircrew member can select the OWS matrix display, press the CLEAR
button (CLR boxed), and then ensure that a maintenance person toggles
the OWS reset switch.

After reset, check that the matrix cleared, CLR is unboxed, and confirm
with maintenance that the ASP 72 status ball is now black instead of
orange. An orange ASP status ball on preflight indicates that the OWS
malfunctioned/failed a BIT or that an over G occurred on the previous
sortie.

Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_23.jpeg:
Important Considerations

The OWS is not programmed to protect individual stores against over G or
to compute maximum allowable G for prohibited maneuvers (yaws greater
than 30° per second, spins, etc.).

At low altitudes and high airspeeds, rapid stick movement (full aft stick in
less than .5 second) can cause high G onset rates. While the OWS works
as designed, a high onset rate may cause serious structural overload
before a warning is given.

In the event of an OWS malfunction or other conditions causing
30 seconds of continuous voice warnings, the OWS shuts down and the

HUD displays only current G.

REMEMBER, ANYTIME THE HUD DISPLAYS ONLY
CURRENT G, NON-OWS G LIMITS MUST BE OBSERVED.

VIDEO TAPE RECORDER SET (VTRS)-3/4 INCH CASSETTE
Description

The VTRS is an onboard video tape recorder used by the aircrew to record
selected displays for post flight evaluation. The MPDs/MPCDs and HUD
displays, along with voice and aural tones, can be recorded automatically
under preset conditions (programmed recording) or manually
(nonprogrammed recording). The VTRS is powered as long as one main
generator is on-line.

Components and Controls

The VTRS uses a special format unlike VHS or BETA. It uses a *4-inch
cassette with a nominal recording time of 30 minutes. A cassette ready
for use has the tape wound on the spool without a colored center dot. The
video tape recorder is located under and aft of the left engine intake and is
accessed through a door near the centerline. The recorder (Figure D-15)
has two buttons labeled TAPE UNTHREAD and CASSETTE REMOVE.
Pressing the CASSETTE REMOVE button opens the cassette
compartment for inserting and removing the cassette.

Operation

Nonprogrammed Recording

Nonprogrammed recording (Figure D-18) is accomplished when the VTRS
record switch is in the ENABLE position (INS control knob must be out of
the OFF position), and

@ the pilot presses the trigger to the 1st detent to record the HUD.

@ either crew member presses PB #12 (RCD) on an appropriate display.

NOTE
Pressing the RCD buttons on two compatible displays results in split-
screen recording.

NOTE

Remember, you are recording (a) particular MPD/MPCDs. If you
change the display format through the menu or through scrolling, you
also change the display format being recorded.

The “RCD” legend and recording cue is not displayed on the PACS, BIT,
MENU, VTRS and MC/DTM displays. To initiate a nonprogrammed
recording of these displays, call them up on a MPD/MPCD on which
recording is already in progress. Stop recording on these displays by
selecting a display format that does have a “RCD” option at PB #12 (or
turn the VTRS to unthread).

NOTE

The presence of a CC clock time at PB #12 or on the HUD is not
100% assurance that the VTRS is recording. Only a green RCD

light on the FCP VTRS control panel is positive verification of
recording.

Programmed Recording

If you know in advance which display(s) you wish to record, you may
program this through the VTRS display. At a minimum, programmed
recording will then occur via HOTAS when either pickle button is pressed.

When you initially call up the VTRS submenu (Figure D-20), the last
programmed selections (display and option) are displayed. You may select
one or two of the eight options available by pressing the button next to the
option. A boxed priority number appears adjacent to the previously
selected option.

@ A/A missile launch commanded by weapons release button (pickle
button) at weapon release through missile time of flight plus five
seconds.

@ GUN selected on weapon select switch and a designated radar target is
less than 10 nm.

Also, the AUTO function will command split-screen recording of the spin
recovery display (SRD) and the HUD when a spin occurs. Recording
continues for 30 seconds after RECOVER is displayed. Although the SRD
is shown on all displays, the VTRS selects the FCP left MPD for recording.

AVI-5 D - 30


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_37.jpeg:
The AUTO function overrides other programmed or nonprogrammed
recording. The VTRS automatically switches to record the HUD (or HUD
and SRD in the event of a spin) until the AUTO conditions no longer exist.
Then the VTRS reverts to recording the previously
nonprogrammed/programmed display(s).

When the gun trigger is depressed to the 1st or 2nd detent, the VTRS also
records the HUD (nonprogrammed recording).

Recording In Progress Cue

Programmed recording in progress (Figure D-23) is indicated when the CC
clock time with an asterisk above and below is displayed on the right side
of the MPD/MPCD. The recording in-progress cue is not displayed on the
PACS, BIT, MENU, VTRS, and MC/DTM displays. (Remember, the
“RCD” display button option is not available on these same displays).

Split-Screen Recording

The VTRS has the capability to record split-screen video for the majority
of display format pairs (either nonprogrammed with the “RCD” push
button or trigger, or programmed with the STBY or RUN options). For
split-screen video to occur, the displays must be refreshed at the same
rate. Some of the display formats are ineligible for split-screen video due
to incompatible synchronization rates. If any two of the following formats
are selected, only the first one selected (or the one assigned priority 1, for
programmed recording) is recorded:

TSD TGT IR

VID2 TF
VID5 NAV FLIR (on HUD or HUD repeater)
VID8

Split-screen recording results in 50% horizontal compression with full size
vertical video.

Preventing Inadvertent Recording (3/4-Inch Cassette Only)

If the previous crew did not terminate recording before aircraft shutdown,
recording is enabled when the INS is turned on. The amplified preflight
checks call for the “Video Tape Record Switch” to be in the “UNTHREAD”
position (Figure D-24). This will prevent inadvertent recording when the
INS is turned on.

Voice Communication and Aural Tones

In order to aid correlation of in-flight occurrences with postflight review of
the video tape recording, voice communications to, from and between the
crew members are recorded on the audio track of the VTRS. Likewise,
aural tones, voice warnings, weapon consent and weapon release tones are
recorded. (The weapon consent/release tones are not heard by the crew
members in the cockpit.)

VIDEO TAPE RECORDER SET (VTRS)-8MM CASSETTE
Description

The VTRS is an onboard video tape recorder used by the aircrew to record
selected displays for post flight evaluation. The MPDs/MPCDs and HUD
displays, along with voice and aural tones, can be recorded automatically
under preset conditions (programmed recording) or manually
(nonprogrammed recording). The VTRS is powered as long as one main
generator is on-line.

Components and Controls

The 8mm VTRS uses 8mm tape cassettes that allow for up to 5 hours of
recording. The 8mm VTRS system consists of a video color tape recorder
and a power panel that are mounted in the rear cockpit on the left console
forward of the throttles and hand controller (Figure D-27).

Power Panel

The power panel has a three-position (OFF, ON and PLAYBACK) toggle
switch. The ON position supplies power to the 8mm VTRS system.
PLAYBACK is not available at this time. ON must be selected in order for
the system to function. (PLAYBACK will provide power to the recorder
also.)

The power light illuminates when both power switches are in the ON
position. The EJECT button provides a means of opening the door for
inserting/removing the cassette. Both power switches must be in the ON
position for the EJECT feature to work.

There is a protective cover over the remaining controls on the recorder.
The cover simply slides back to provide access to the controls.

Starting from the left of the recorder, the first control is the STOP button
( ). Pressing it-will terminate the function selected. Next is the REW
(rewind) button ( ). Pressing and holding men will rewind the
cassette. The next control is the PLAY button ( ©). If PLAYBACK were
available, pressing the PLAY button wouldallow for viewing of the
cassette. The FF (fast forward) button ( é) ) is the next control.
Pressing and holding this button will fast-forward the tape.

The PAUSE button ( ) is the next control. Pressing this button will
pause the tape. Pressing the button a second time allows for the
resumption of the previous function. If you press one of the other control
buttons, that function is selected. There is a PAUSE light to signify when
the recorder is in the pause mode. There is a 5 minute counter on the
PAUSE button. With REC and PAUSE selected, both will automatically
deselect after 5 minutes. The REC (record) switch is the next control.
Sliding the switch to the right and releasing it selects the record mode for
the recorder. The REC light comes on when REC is selected and there is
tape remaining.

Below those controls are several features/options:
@ The AUDIO MONITOR button is not used.

@ Tape speed is selected with the SP/LP button. Pressing the button
alternatively selects Slow Play (SP) or Long Play (LP) speed. Based on
the cassette used, the system will record up to 5 hours with Long Play
selected or 2.5 hours with Slow Play selected. If time is not factor, the
Slow Play will give higher quality recording than the Long Play option.

@ The COUNTER RESET button permits resetting the tape counter to
0:00:00.

window) is also not used. DEW INDICATOR flashes in the display

window when there is moisture inside the recorder. The recorder should
be allowed to dry out before use.

After main generator power is available, the ON position on the power
panel should be selected. The video recorder power switch should then be
moved to the ON position. Moving the EJECT switch to the right will
open the door to permit the cassette to be inserted into the recorder.
Gently push the door to the close position. Sliding the REC switch to the
right initiates recording. Without record commands from the VTRS
display and without RCD (PB #12) buttons selected, the recorder records
the HUD (without symbology) and cockpit audio.

Several options exist for day to day operation of the recorder. Based on
the length of the tape used and the tape speed selected, there should be
sufficient tape to select REC prior to takeoff and tape the entire flight.
During the mission use either programmed or manual (PB #12/trigger)
recording to tape the desired events. During debrief, this could require a
bit of searching to locate the desired events.

AVI-5 D - 40


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_47.jpeg:
Another option is to command either programmed or nonprogrammed
recording and then select REC just prior to the events to be taped. After
the event is completed, PAUSE or STOP will cease recording. Pressing
PAUSE a second time (if PAUSE was used to stop recording) will re-
initiate recording. If STOP was used, sliding the REC switch to the right
will initiate recording again. If either or both power switches are used to
terminate recording, the power switches must be returned to the ON
position and REC selected again to start recording. Although the recorder
is capable of recording color images, the equipment in the aircraft will not
permit color recording.

The cassette must be removed prior to both main generators going off-line.
Otherwise, an external power unit will be required to eject the cassette.

Operation

Nonprogrammed, programmed and split-screen recording are
accomplished the same with the 8mm cassette and the 3/4-inch cassette.
The recording in-progress cue, weapon consent/release cue, and voice
communication and aural tones are also displayed/heard under the same
conditions while using the 8mm cassette. (Refer to the Nonprogrammed
Recording, Programmed Recording, Recording In Progress Cue, Split-
Screen Recording, Weapon Consent/Release Cue, and Voice
Communication and Aural Tones sections on pages D-25 through D-36 of
this workbook.)

Preventing Inadvertent Recording (8mm Only)

Prior to turning the recorder on and initiating recording, check the VTRS
display to confirm that programmed and/or nonprogrammed recording of
any displays have not been commanded. If there is an asterisk by a
display, then that display is being commanded to record. If programmed
recording has been commanded (RUN is selected), select STBY or OFF.

If there is an asterisk by a display after confirming that STBY or OFF is
selected, then nonprogrammed recording has been commanded. Go to
that display, select a display with a format that normally has the “RCD”
option at PB #12 (radar, ADI, HSI, etc.). PB #12 will display the CC clock.
Select PB #12, “RCD” will be displayed and nonprogrammed recording
will terminate.

D-41 AVI-5


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_48.jpeg:
In order for the recorder to record a display, the REC light must be on and
either programmed or nonprogrammed recording must be commanded. If
the REC light is on, both power switches are in the ON position and REC
has been selected. The video recorder cannot be in the record mode upon
starting the engines. If it loses power while in the record mode, i.e., the
engines are shut down, the record mode is deselected.

If the REC light is not illuminated on the recorder, the system is not
recording. Displays can be in the record mode but will not be recorded
unless the REC light is on. Bottom line: to record a display, the REC light
must be on and recording must be commanded by either the VTRS
display, PB #12 or the trigger/weapons release switch.

HUD TITLING

Description

HUD titling is a method of entering and recording specific mission data to
identify the video tape for postflight analysis.

AVI-5 D - 42


Text from AVI-5_OWS_VTRS__MC-DTM_page_49.jpeg:
Operation

The HUD titling format is programmed using the data transfer module
(DTM) or manually using the UFC HUD titling submenu (Figure D-29).
The HUD titling submenu is accessed through Menu 2 by pressing PB #4
to bring up the PP keeping source submenu. Then, press PB #7 (HUD
TITL) to bring up the HUD titling submenu and the title format on the
HUD.

HUD Titling Submenu

The submenu displays the following information to be recorded on the
video tape:

Button 1: Month - Day 9: Squadron (local use)
2: Year 8: Pilot/‘WSO numbers (local use)
3: Mission type 7: Wing

4: A/C (Tail Number)

Changes in the title, if required, are made through the UFC via the
keyboard and the associated option push button. Leading zeros are not
required. The day can be changed by typing in one or two digits. The
month is changed by typing in the month (one or two digits) plus the “-“
and the day (one or two digits). Mission type changes can be entered as
one or two digit numbers. Tail number changes require the entire set of
characters to be typed, for example, 87-0188. The year is entered using
only the last two digits.

Location 1 and 2 (LOC-1 and LOC-2) are undefined buffers. They are
used locally for the squadron number and the pilot/WSO numbers (e.g.,
Pilot-01, WSO-02). Only those items that are different from those
previously programmed must be entered.

LOC-1 = 0333 (Squadron number)
LOC-2 = 0102 (Pilot/WSO numbers)

MISSION CARTRIDGE (MC)/DATA TRANSFER MODULE (DTM)
Description

Prior to TCTO 1F-15E-700, the DTM provides the means to transfer
mission data from the AFMSS to the aircraft. It also provides for
transferring operations data from the aircraft back to the AFMSS and
maintenance data from the aircraft to the computerized fault reporting
system (CFRS).

After TCTO 1F-15E-700, the MC will be the primary means of
transferring mission data from the AFMSS to the aircraft and for
transferring operations data from the aircraft to the AFMSS. The DTM
can continue to be used for this function if the MC is not available or
malfunctioning. If the MC is used, the DTM and MC can be used for
transferring mission data to the aircraft and back to the AFMSS. The
DTM will continue to be the means for transferring maintenance data
from the aircraft to the CFRS.

If the MC is utilized, the DTM can be either an ops or maintenance DTM.
The computer in the aircraft recognizes the DTM as either ops or
maintenance from the structure of the information on the DTM. If the
DTM is loaded via AFMSS, it is loaded with a directory structure that
identifies it as an ops DTM. Maintenance DTMs are not normally used on
the AFMSS, therefore a directory structure is not loaded on the DTM. If
an ops DTM is erased, the directory structure is erased and the computer
sees it as a maintenance DTM.

The problem in the past has been the classification of the ops DTM. With
the MC being used as the means to transfer mission data, the
maintenance DTM can be used to transfer the unclassified maintenance
data from the aircraft to the CFRS. The CC knows that it is a
maintenance DTM and will block the transfer of classified data to the
maintenance DTM, thus allowing the transfer of unclassified data to
CFRS.

The MC is inserted into the MC receptacle on the right console in the rear

cockpit. The DTM is inserted in the DTM receptacle on the right
instrument panel in the front cockpit.

OVERLOAD WARNING SYSTEM (OWS)
Description

The OWS gives the crew warnings that the maximum allowable G is being
approached or has been exceeded. The OWS provides:

@ A900 Hz intercom tone at 85% maximum allowable G (or 1 G below
maximum allowable, whichever is lower), interrupted at a 4 Hz rate to
produce a slow/single rate beeping sound.

@ A900 Hz intercom tone at 92% maximum allowable G, interrupted at
a 10 Hz rate to produce a fast/double rate beeping sound (about twice

the initial rate).

@ A voice warning heard at 100% maximum allowable G (“OVER G,
OVER G”).

@ A stored record of overloads at or above 85% maximum allowable G.

The OWS is available as long as one main generator is on-line to power
the CC. Any input system failure or malfunction results in the OWS
shutting down or becoming unreliable. For example, if AIU 2 fails, OWS
computations will not be made. Other input malfunctions such as ADC
failure, fuel quantity malfunctions or trapped external fuel will render the
OWS unreliable. In these cases, comply with the TO 1F-15E-1 non-OWS

Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_10.jpeg:
HQ II

HQ II radios have an expanded memory board (EMB) added to the radio.
The nonvolatile memory, i.e., memory that is not erased when power is
removed, allows HQ II to store additional information without using the
radio’s channel storage area. Not only does the EMB make channels
15-19 available for normal UHF operation, but it also increases the
amount of information that can be stored. The training frequencies
previously limited to 5 by basic HQ are increased to 16 stored on the EMB.
This increases the number of training nets to sixteen (vice five) providing
more flexibility and deconfliction.

To provide compatibility with basic HQ users, HQ II radios can also enter
WOD elements in preset channels 15-20, using basic HQ procedures.

With HQ II, frequency managed training net frequencies are stored in the
HQ II radio’s expanded memory board. The WOD element in preset
channel 20 performs mode selection and hop rate, but the frequencies in
preset channels 19-15 are not used for HQ operations—only initialization.
You will normally use this option in your day-to-day training.

Regardless of whether you operate in basic HQ or HQ II mode, HQ II
radios are initialized for HQ operation by rotating the channel selector
backwards from channel 20 to channel 15 to “load” the WOD.

Multiple Words-of-the-Day (WOD)

Another advantage of HQ II increased memory is the capacity to store and
retrieve up to six days WODs, referred to as multiple WODs (MWOD).
The selection of the next day’s WOD from the available MWODs is done
through a “date tag” loaded with each WOD. To use the WOD that
corresponds to a specific date, the radio must be told the current day of
the month manually or through an encoded time-of-day (TOD) signal with
the date appended. In the near future, a GPS signal could make WOD
selection for the current day automatic at power up on start.

The HQ II capability to store six WODs and automatically reset itself to

the next day’s WOD when it recognizes 2400Z has eliminated one of basic
HQs shortfalls.

AVI-6 D-4


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_11.jpeg:
Time-of-Day (TOD)

While HQ radios are in the anti-jam (AJ) mode they are continuously
hopping through frequencies. (Anti-jam operation is also known as
“active” mode because the radio is actively changing frequency.) To
ensure that all radios start together and hop to each new frequency
simultaneously, a method of synchronization is required. The TOD signal,
commonly referred to as a “Mickey,” is used to provide coordinated
hopping. TOD information is transmitted by a data-burst message 1/4
second in duration on any UHF frequency.

The TOD message contains Universal Coordinated Time (time-of-day) and
may contain date information (day-of-month). The date information
applies only to HQ II radios. After the radio is turned on it accepts the
first TOD signal it “hears,” regardless of what frequency or channel it is
on.

There are three possible sources for a TOD. The first method is via the
AN/TRC-187 or the older AN/TRC-177 time signal set. This is the
preferred and most accurate source for a TOD. These are the standard
TOD generators located in the command post or within radio maintenance
at most bases. The AN/TRC-187 timing is coordinated via satellite with
other TOD generators around the world and is accurate to nanoseconds
per month.

The second source of a Mickey is from another HQ user. Anyone using HQ
can pass their TOD to you. Though it is not as accurate as the TOD
generator, it gives an acceptable time and allows the users of that common
TOD to converse. This method is usually used by C® assets, AWACS,
ABCCC, a flight leader or the mission commander for a specific package.

The final method of getting a Mickey is to self-generate the TOD. This
method synchronizes your radio with no one else (until you pass along
your TOD) but may have application if operating out of a remote location
or if the base TOD generator is inoperative. This procedure allows a flight
leader to self-start his radio and then pass his TOD to other flight
members. It is possible to send or receive a TOD on both normal and
active modes.

Self-generated TODs may be fine for short training sorties, but are not
accurate enough to be used by a large cross section of aircraft.
Communication with aircraft using TOD generator signals would be
impossible, because their TODs would be different.

D-5 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_12.jpeg:
The TOD is passed as a two-tone BEEP-BOOP when generated by another
aircraft. The first tone is higher pitched than the second and is where the
encoded message lies.

The TOD is stored in the radio on which it was received and must be
obtained at the beginning of each flight. It is different from the VHSIC
CC clock time and lost at power down. The F-15E cannot currently obtain
a time-of-day for HQ from the GPS satellite system.

The HQ system can “drift” during flight, resulting in garbled
communications. There are procedures available to check the amount of
drift to determine if system maintenance is required; refer to the TAWC
HAVE QUICK handbook for specific information.

Net

A net is a coded signal used for synchronized frequency hopping during AJ
operation. Nets provide deconfliction when a large number of players
wish to use anti-jam communication. The net number determines the
order in which the radio hops among the frequencies loaded by the WOD
elements or stored in the EMB and radio channel memory storage.
Currently there are four basic types of nets available for basic HQ. These
are training nets, A-nets, sectionalized A-nets and B-nets (AWACS
communications) for combat. HQ II radios can use all four types of basic
nets.

Three additional types of nets are available for HQ II use only. They are
frequency managed NATO (FMA-nets), frequency managed non-NATO
(FMA-nets) and frequency managed training nets (FMT-nets). FMA-nets
provide 1000 nets for NATO use and an additional 1000 nets for non-
NATO countries. HQ IT FMT-nets provide an additional 16 nets for use in
training.

A-nets and FMA-nets are for combat only, and are jam resistant. Four
MHZ frequency separation is guaranteed. During normal peacetime
operations, only the training modes (T-nets and FMT-nets) are used.
During Red Flags and other similar exercises, the combat mode may be
used. The following discussion is limited to training nets (T-nets and
FMT-nets).

Training Net Selection

UHF frequencies containing net numbers are used to tell the HQ radio
which net to operate on. The frequency is 30b.b cc for a training net. The

AVI-6 D-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_13.jpeg:
digits b.b contain the net number. Net 01 is selected with frequency 0.0,
and net 02 with frequency 0.1, etc.

The digits cc tell the HQ II radio to operate in basic HQ or HQ II training
mode. The digits cc are either 00 or 25. A training net number ending in
00 tells the radio to use a basic HQ T-net. A training net number ending
in 25 tells the radio to use HQ II FMT-net. To select T-net 2, AJ is
selected with the radio set to frequency 300.1 00. To select FMT-net 13,
AJ is selected with the radio set to frequency 301.2 25.

The frequencies that define T-nets or FMT-nets are not WOD elements,
and may be preset as a channel or selected as a normal manual frequency.
They are usable as normal UHF frequency in “plain” UHF operation and

select a net as described below in anti-jam operation.

Basic HQ T-Nets

Basic T-nets can be used by a basic HQ radio or a HQ II radio using basic
procedures. The WOD element frequencies entered in preset channels
15-19 storage are the frequencies used by the five basic T-nets. They are
the frequencies the radio hops through during HQ operations.

The nets are numbered 1-5 and are selected by switching to the
frequencies 300.000 - 300.400 on the appropriate radio. 300.000 is net 1,
300.100 is net 2, etc. If 300.500 is selected, it uses the same frequencies
as 300.000 (net 1); 300.600 uses the same as 300.100 (net 2), etc. (Table D-
1). The 00 in the hundredths and thousandths position distinguish these
nets as basic HQ T-nets to a HQ II radio. Since channel memory is used
for basic HQ WOD storage, preset channels 15-19 are not available to
channelize a T-net as one of the radio’s preset frequencies.

Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_14.jpeg:
HQ II T-Nets (Nonvolatile Memory)

With HQ II radios, the frequencies the radio uses to hop among during
HQ operations can be preset in channels 15-19 (basic operations) or they
can be stored in HQ II nonvolatile memory (KEMB). The coded frequencies
that are loaded as WOD elements through channels 15-19 using HQ II
procedures are the frequencies used in the five T-nets. The nets are
numbered in the same manner as basic HQ nets. If basic HQ operation is
not desired, channels 15-19 do not need to contain WOD elements and
may be used for normal UHF operation when the radio is transmitting in
the “plain” mode of operation, i.e. anti-jam operation not selected.

HQ II FMT-Nets

For training purposes, HAVE QUICK II provides 16 FMT-nets in addition
to the five T-nets already in the HQ system. To use the FMT-nets, 16
training frequencies must be loaded into the radio EMB. Unlike the T-net
frequencies, these frequencies (provided later in this workbook) are not
part of the training WOD.

The nets are numbered 1-16 and are identified by the frequencies 300.025
- 301.525 (300.025 is FMT-net 1, etc.). A WOD must be loaded in order to
use the FMT-nets (See Table D-2). The suffix 25 identifies these nets as
HQ II FMT-nets to the HQ II radio.

The FMT-net frequencies may be used as “plain” UHF channelized or
manual frequencies in normal UHF mode or to select a net in anti-jam
mode.

Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_15.jpeg:
Normal Operation

Normal anti-jam operation of Have Quick radios requires preparation of
the radio and selection of the anti-jam mode with common codes for the
participating radios. A basic HQ radio requires the crew or maintenance
personnel to channelize the WOD elements in channels 15-19 as well as
an initialization code in the WOD element stored in channel 20. WOD
elements are usually preset by maintenance or read to the radio by DTM
transfer. These elements may not be changed without requiring the
channels to be reprogrammed prior to the next HQ use.

If HQ II training nets (FMT-nets) are to be used the channel storage area
information may be used for normal UHF channels since it is not used for
anti-jam operation. Maintenance or, on rare occasions, the aircrew must
enter the training net frequencies to the EMB prior to net selection.

On every sortie that uses HQ the crew must “load” the WOD to the radio
by cycling the rotary channel selector knob backwards from channel 20 to
15. For basic HQ, this initializes the radio and loads the WOD elements.
HQ II operation requires this same set of actions, i.e., cycling the rotary
channel selector knob 20-15, to initialize the radio.

A time synchronization signal known as a TOD must be received by the
radios to enable simultaneous hopping. The signal may be externally or
internally generated. External TODs are normally received on a UHF
channel or frequency reserved for a dedicated TOD generator broadcasting
continuously. A second party may retransmit a TOD received from a TOD
generator, a third aircraft or one that was self-generated. A radio can
start its own clock without receiving another TOD, and then pass that
reference to others. The radio will accept the first TOD it hears
transmitted immediately after turn on. Additional TODs require putting
the radio in a mode to receive a TOD and tuning to the frequency where it
will be broadcast. Once a TOD is received the HQ has the time of day
reference to synchronize with other radios using the same time signal
reference.

D-9 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_16.jpeg:
To initiate HQ anti-jam operation the crew must select a net of common
frequencies and mode of operation by identifying the HQ net in the form of
a plain UHF frequency. The frequency convention is identified by
changing the “frequency” of the UHF to the net code manually or by
selecting a channel that contains the net. Finally, select anti-jam (AJ on
the UFC UHF submenu). If you are successful, when the microphone is
keyed a faint ticking will be heard as the radio channel hops.

Alert and Warning Tones

Alert and warning tones are heard in your headset when the HQ radio
identifies a problem within its system. Generally speaking, if a steady
tone is heard when HQ operation is attempted, no WOD and/or TOD
information is loaded. If an interrupted tone is heard, an incorrect net is
in use. When troubleshooting a HQ problem, rule out the obvious first.
Did you load the WOD properly? Did you get a TOD? Was it a good TOD?
Did you load the WOD and get the TOD on the same radio? Do you have
the correct net selected? Are you on manual versus a preset? If the
answer to all these questions is yes, you should reload the WOD, get
another TOD and re-check the net frequency. If HQ still does not work,
you might try HQ on the other radio.

HAVE QUICK and the F-15E

So far this discussion of HQ has been general in an attempt to help you
develop an understanding of the basics of HQ. Next is a description of
F-15E equipment used to operate HQ and the procedures that enable you
to work the system. During the discussion bear in mind local HQ
operations are normally limited to UHF 2 using HQ II FMT-nets, i.e. the
expanded memory board frequencies.

Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_17.jpeg:
Upfront Control (UFC) Displays and Switchology

HQ use begins with the UHF submenu, either UHF 1 or UHF 2. At
Seymour Johnson AFB, daily training sorties would use the UHF 2

submenu and UHF 2 channel selector. PB #1 is the ON/OFF power switch

for the radio. PB #1 is also used in conjunction with presetting
frequencies within that radio. PB #38, AJ, selects/deselects the HQ

anti-jam mode. PB #5 and PB #6 are used to enter manual frequencies for
UHF 1 and 2. PB #8, TOD, enables the radio to accept the next TOD

generated. PB #10 is used in conjunction with changing preset

frequencies (Figure D-1).

WOD Load

After the DTM has completed data transfer, rotate the UHF channel
selector knob from channel 20 to channel 15 one channel at a time to load
the WOD. Preset frequency operation must be selected, i.e., the asterisk
must appear next to the channel selector knob. As each channel is
selected, a single beep should be heard. When channel 15 is selected, a
double beep should be heard. The double beep indicates that the WOD
has been loaded.

In normal UHF operation, channel 20 is reserved for both basic HQ and
HQ II WOD initialization. Do not rotate to channel 20 unless you desire
to reload the WOD.

As preset channel memory is used for basic HQ WOD storage, channels
15-20 are not available for normal use during basic HQ AJ operation. HQ
II operations using FMT-nets and the frequencies contained in expanded
memory do not require WOD elements programmed in channels 15-19.
These elements are only required when HQ II radios are operated in basic
HQ mode for compatibility with non-HQ II users. (Cycling channel 15-19
is still necessary to initialize the radio for either mode of operation.)
Except for basic HQ operations, HQ II channels 15-19 may be used for
normal (non-HQ) operations.

Tone Switch

The tone switch is located in both the front cockpit (remote
intercommunications control panel) and rear cockpit
(intercommunications set control panel). This switch allows you to
self-generate a tone for your TOD, or to pass your TOD (regardless of the
source (self-generated or from an outside source)) to another aircraft. It
also allows you to load frequencies into nonvolatile memory for HQ II
operations. The switch is spring loaded to the center position. Forward
works with UHF 1, while aft performs the same operations for UHF 2
(Figure D-2). The HQ II function of this switch is determined by the last
command code entered into the radio.

Receiving the TOD

The TOD is normally received on the preset channel or manual frequency
of the TOD generator. It may be self-generated by the flight lead and
passed to the flight using a discrete frequency assigned on the flying
schedule. This frequency is scheduled to deconflict individual flight
FMT-nets and serves as a discrete aux (“plain”) frequency while airborne
if AJ ops are not desired.

To receive the TOD, first select the UHF submenu for the UHF that
contains the WOD and set the radio to the frequency (manual or preset)
on which the TOD will be transmitted. Then depress PB #8 adjacent to
“TOD” (Figure D-3). This places an asterisk by PB #8 for one second and
allows the radio to accept a TOD for a period of up to one minute. This is
not necessary for the first TOD after radio turn on as the radio accepts the
first TOD it hears. If the TOD is received, you hear the beep-boop tone.

Self-Starting the TOD

When a tone generator is unavailable and there is no other aircraft with a
valid Mickey, an individual aircraft can start its own clock. This TOD will
be synchronized only to other users to whom the TOD is subsequently
passed.

AVI-6 D-14


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_21.jpeg:
To accomplish a self-start TOD, select the UHF submenu and hold the
tone switch to the appropriate radio position. While holding the tone
switch, depress PB #8 (Figure D-3) on the UFC and listen for a single
beep.

HAVE QUICK Anti-Jam (AJ) Operation

After the WOD and TOD have been loaded, anti-jam operation on UHF 2
is initiated as follows:

Select manual, type the net frequency in the scratchpad and enter at
PB #6. Figure D-4 indicates that FMT-net number 5 has been
selected. You may also have the net frequency preset in a channel. In
that situation, you would select the preset channel instead of going to
the manual frequency. Ensure the manual frequency or channel has
an asterisk indicating which is selected.

Clear the scratchpad, select the UHF 2 submenu, and press PB #3
adjacent to AJ. Selecting AJ places the radio in narrow band (NB
appears adjacent to PB #9), and initiates anti-jam channel hopping.

after the radio legend (i.e., U1, U2) at PB #4 or #7 to indicate
which radio is selected for KY-58 operation. Additionally, the
appropriate radio legend is starred.

PB #38 BB/DP - Two operating submodes, baseband (BB) and
diphase (DP) are selectable at PB #3. Although either
submode is available for use, all members of the formation
must be operating on the same submode.

PB #2 PLAIN/CIPHER - When PLAIN is selected, the UHF radio is
operating normally and is not secure. When CIPHER is
selected, the radio operates in secure speech. Additionally,
when CIPHER is selected the first time, you get a series of
beeps as the secure system initializes itself. Key and release
the mic switch to clear the beeps. Either OPR (PB #1) or RV
(PB #10) must be starred (*) in order to select CIPHER.

PB #1 OPR - Operate (OPR) is the other normal operating mode

(along with RV) and is selected by pressing PB #1. OPR will
star when selected. Select OPR, if desired.

Operation is as follows:

@ KY-58 operations are very different from normal radio operations.
When you select CIPHER the first time, you get the series of beeps
described above. Clear the crypto alarm beeps with the mic button.
On subsequent transmissions, you will hear a single beep
(approximately one second after keying the mic). Wait until you hear
this beep before speaking.

@ Next, when speaking, SPEAK SLOWLY AND CONCISELY. Avoid
long statements - try to keep your transmissions to 2-4 words at a
time.

@ Ifno beep or side/carrier wave is heard, i.e., the radio is silent, when
attempting CIPHER transmissions, the KY-58 is inoperative; notify
maintenance. Ifa steady tone is heard along with a side/carrier wave
when CIPHER transmissions are attempted, the KY-58 has a problem
with its crypto and secure operations are not possible.

The following expanded HAVE QUICK information is not
required for FTU operations and will not be included in the
phase test.

HAVE QUICK PROGRAMMING

The first section of this workbook presented an overview of the HQ
capabilities and the elements involved in general AJ operations. It
concluded with a very narrow look at the steps necessary to go “active” on
a generic training mission.

What follows is information that is at times hard to put your finger on, but
is normally not required except in special circumstances, i.e.,
malfunctions, exercise deployments or combat. Read through it for
understanding, and practice it in the CBT lesson. These are the
procedures to manually enter all the frequencies and codes we take for
granted in daily training.

Basic HQ WOD Loading

The WOD elements are normally entered into preset channels 15-20 using
the Air Force mission support system (AFMSS) and mission cartridge/data
transfer module (MC/DTM). Additionally, the following procedures can be
used to manually enter the basic HQ WOD elements using the UHF
submenu in the aircraft.

@ While in channel mode, select channel 20 with the channel selector
knob (a single beep is heard).

@ Select the appropriate UHF submenu.
@ For this example, use the following as the WOD elements:

Ch 20 300.050
Ch 19 225.150
Ch 18 236.050
Ch 17 229.100

HQ IT Command Codes

As there are no conventional radio switches to work with, four command
code “frequencies” have been designated to act as switches when entered
into channel 20. For HQ II operation, channel 20 can be considered to be
a radio switch. The four command code frequencies (described below) can
be considered to be four different switch positions.

When preset channel 20 is changed to a command code frequency, the
radio is switched to the corresponding HQ II function to make it possible
to enter WOD elements in multiple WODs (MWOD), erase a WOD, load
the frequency managed training frequencies or return the radio to normal
operation.

The command code frequencies were chosen based on two requirements.
First, each frequency had to be an invalid UHF frequency, i.e., below
225.000, and second, it had to be equal to or greater than 220.000 because
of design limitations of the radio. The command code frequencies and
related functions are as follows:

Command Code Frequeney
220.000 Operate/Verify

220.025 WOD Load
220.050 WOD Erase
220.075 FMT-Net Load

Table D - 6.

These are the only four “frequencies” that act as switch positions. Notice
that they are identical except for the last two digits. It is not necessary to
memorize these numbers as they are included in HQ II checklists.

Briefly, the Operate/Verify command switches both radios to the normal
operate mode. The MWOD Load command prepares both radios to accept
MWODs, MWOD elements and date assignments. The MWOD Erase
command is used to erase an MWOD. The FMT-Net Frequency Load
command is used to load the FMT-net training frequencies to the
expanded memory board.

D- 35 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_42.jpeg:
When the command code frequency for MWOD Load, MWOD Erase or
FMT-Net Frequency Load is entered into channel 20, the normal
transmit/receive functions of both radios are disabled in preparation for
programming functions.

HQ II MWOD Loading

To initiate the MWOD loading procedure for UHF 2, select either UHF
submenu and do the following:

@ Type 20 into the scratchpad and enter at PB #1. Type the MWOD

heard each time the tone is toggled to UHF 2. An entire WOD is now
stored in nonvolatile radio memory.

AVI-6 D - 38


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_45.jpeg:
Next, a day of the month date must be assigned to the WOD through
channel 14.

WOD Date

The date code frequency is 3XX.000; the XX digits of the frequency
represent the day of the month. For example, if it is the 18th day of the
month, the frequency is 318.000. Use the following procedure to load the
WOD date:

@ Type 14 into the scratchpad and enter at PB #1. Type the applicable
day of the month frequency into the scratchpad and enter at PB #10.
In our example, the WOD stored is for the 18th day of the month;
therefore, the frequency is 318.000. Next, toggle the tone switch to
UHF 2. A double beep should be heard.

At this point, one complete WOD and its corresponding date are stored in
nonvolatile memory in the radio. As a reminder, this process has not
changed preset channels 14-19. Additional WODs can be stored by
repeating these procedures. The system retains the six most recently
loaded WODs.

If a WOD is loaded with the same date as one already in memory, the new
entry replaces the prior entry. There is no way to access or call up a
previously loaded WOD. Therefore, if a single WOD element must be
changed, the entire WOD for that date must be reloaded.

If you intend to use anti-jam (AJ) immediately, continue with WOD
selection. If not, enter the Operate/Verify command code in channel 20.

With an MWOD loaded, HQ II radios need to be told which day’s WOD to
use. This is currently being done by entering the date in channel 1. Plans
call for fielding a tone generator that will transmit a TOD with not only
the correct time but also the day of the year and the year. Upon receipt of
this improved Mickey, a HQ II radio will set its clock to the correct time
and day of the month and transfer the correct WOD into its processor.
With this done, the radio is ready for net selection. You would not have to
enter a date in channel 1 as the TOD selects the correct WOD.

D - 39 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_46.jpeg:
WOD Selection

Once the WOD/WODs have been stored, the current day's date must be
loaded through channel 1 to set the radio's clock so it can select the correct
WOD for use. With the radio still in the MWOD Load function, the
procedure to enter the present day of the month is as follows:

@ Type 1 into the scratchpad and enter at PB #1. Type the frequency for
the applicable day of the month and enter at PB #10. In our example,
it is the 18th day of the month so the frequency is 318.000.

@ Next toggle the tone switch to UHF 2 and listen for a single beep. You
have now selected the WOD.

NOTE

If the radio is switched off, the current day's date is not retained in radio
memory. Therefore, to regain use of the current day's WOD after the radio is

turned back on, you would first change channel 20 to the MWOD Load
command code frequency (220.025). The frequency for the day of the month
would then be reloaded through channel 1.

After you have stored the MWOD and selected a WOD for use, you must
enter the Operate/Verify command code (220.000) in channel 20 to return
the radio to normal operation. You are now ready to receive a TOD and
commence AJ operations.

NOTE

Soon the tone generators that transmit the TOD will be modified so that they
transmit both the correct time and date (day-of-year and year). When you

receive a TOD from a modified tone generator, you will not have to enter the
date through channel 1 as the TOD will include the needed date information.

AVI-6 D - 40


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_47.jpeg:
A HQ II radio can append date information to its own Mickey. For
example, a flight leader can enter the WOD date through channel 1 as
previously discussed. The leader can then self-start the radio, or, if an
AN/TRC-187 TOD generator is available, the leader can update the
Mickey (for time) using normal procedures. The correct time and date are
now added to any TOD lead passes to the flight.

MWOD Erase

This function enables you to completely erase the nonvolatile memory
containing the MWOD. To erase the entire MWOD:

@ Change preset channel 20 to command code 220.050.

NOTE

The memory has not been erased yet. You can still recover. If it was not
your intent to erase the MWOD, change channel 20 to the Operate/Verify

command code 220.000. If you still want to erase it, proceed to the next
step.

@ Push the C/M button to select manual (if in channel).

@ Toggle the tone switch to the UHF that contains the MWOD. The tone
switch initiates the erasure operation.

@ Change channel 20 to the Operate/Verify command code 220.000, in
order to switch both radios back to the normal operate mode.

NOTE

It is not necessary to type decimal points and trailing zeros when entering
command codes and WOD elements.

FMT-Net Frequency Load

This HAVE QUICK II function is normally performed by maintenance on
a one time basis as the frequencies are stored in nonvolatile memory and
do not change. The following procedure is used to load the FMT-net
frequencies into UHF 2:

Select the UHF 2 submenu and check that the radio is on.

Select channel and turn the channel selector knob to channel 20. A
single beep sounds.

Enter 20 at PB #1 and enter the FMT-net Load command code
(220.075) at PB #10.

Select manual, type the first net frequency, 235.050, into the

channel 20 is changed to command code frequency 220.000 as follows:

@ Type 20 into the scratchpad and enter at PB #1. Type 220.000 into the
scratchpad and enter at PB #10.

The Verify portion of the command code is used to verify the presence of a
particular day's WOD. To verify the presence of a WOD in UHF 2, select
the UHF 2 submenu and accomplish the following:

@ Rotate the channel selector knob to channel 20.

@ Type the desired day of the month frequency in the scratchpad and
enter it at PB #6. For example, for the 15th day, the frequency would
be 315.000. Do not toggle the tone switch.

@ Select manual with the C/M button.

@ Rotate the channel selector knob to channel 19 and back to channel 20;
listen for a single beep. If there is no beep, a WOD for that date is not

C-1 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_50.jpeg:
The following summarizes the F-15E HAVE QUICK II arrangement:

Channel 20 is used for two purposes. It accepts the command code
frequencies that act as switches to initiate HAVE QUICK II functions.
It also is used to enter and load the first element of the WOD.

Channels 19-15 are used to enter and load the second through the
sixth elements of the WOD.

Channel 14 is used to enter and load the WOD date frequency that
labels each WOD of the MWOD with a specific date.

Channel 1 is used to enter and load the current day of the month
frequency that enables the radio to select the correct WOD.

Preset channels 1-19 are not affected by these functions and remain
available for use as originally preset.

Anytime channel 20 is changed to the command code frequency for
MWOD Load, MWOD Erase, or FMT-Net Frequency Load, both UHF 1
and 2 are switched out of the normal operate mode making it
impossible to transmit or receive on either radio. To regain use of the
radios, the operate portion of the Operate/Verify command code must
be reentered.

When loaded, the FMT-net frequencies are stored in nonvolatile radio
memory. The FMT-nets can be used in conjunction with a basic WOD
or a HQ II WOD.

TEXT
HAVE QUICK RADIO

In the late ‘70s, our susceptibility to communications jamming was
recognized as the Achilles’ heel of the Tactical Air Forces’ (TAF) command,
control and communication (C*) operations. A workable solution to this
problem was needed quickly. HAVE QUICK (HQ) provided the answer,
furnishing a jam resistant radio that used “off-the-shelf” parts and the
current radio used in most fighter aircraft. HQ is now utilized by TAF
aircrews throughout the world; the list of users includes most fighter
aircraft, AWACS, GCI, forward air controllers and many units from other
commands. This workbook addresses the unclassified portions of the basic
HQ and HQ II radios. More information is available in your squadron
weapons section and in the Tactical Air Warfare Center (TAWC) HAVE
QUICK handbook (SECRET).

Background

Both basic HQ and HQ II employ a pseudo-random frequency hopping
technique that gives them a jam resistant capability. For the layman’s
level of understanding, the radio randomly hops among a set number of
frequencies. Synchronized hopping is a more accurate term since random
hopping would not allow two people operating on the same set of
frequencies to converse. When synchronized, all radios are on the same
frequency. They simply change frequencies automatically on a regular
basis. HQ is not a method for secure radio transmissions since they are
still broadcast in clear text and not encrypted.

D-1 AVI-6


Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_8.jpeg:
Requirements for HQ Radio Usage

Both basic HQ and HQ II are fully compatible with the ARC-164 radios
currently installed in the F-15E. Basic HQ uses the UHFs storage for
channelized frequencies to store HQ variables. This prevents the use of
these channels for normal radio operation. HQ II adds an expanded
memory board to the radio to free up channel storage and increase the
number of stored variables. HQ II may still use channel storage but does
not require it. Basic HQ users cannot program or use HQ II specific
features. HQ II is backward compatible with basic HQ and provides
additional flexibility. Although you normally will use HQ IJ, you may load
both systems and then use either system on UHF 1, UHF 2 or both radios
simultaneously.

Anyone wishing to participate requires a word-of-day (WOD) containing
initialization and frequency codes, a time-of-day (TOD) synchronization
signal and an HQ “active” net (common set) of frequencies to perform
basic HQ or HQ II operations. Different nets allow flights to deconflict
HQ use in the same manner as discrete UHF frequencies deconflict
normal radio transmissions. The WOD, the TOD and the net determine
the type of operation (basic HQ or HQ II), combat or training mode, the
number of frequencies, the hopping order and rate.

Because basic HQ was a modification of existing hardware, normal UHF
control functions and hardware are modified in HQ to actually perform
HQ programming or operation through the radio control head. This can
be confusing at first because programming information and net selection
take place through the use of codes that appear as frequencies. In fact,
the frequency may be simultaneously a usable manual frequency in
“plain” (normal) UHF operation and a specific coded “net” (set of frequency
codes) in “active” (HQ) operation.

HQ II continues the frequency interface convention to use nonfunctional

invalid frequencies in the RF spectrum as command codes to prepare the
radio for loading, selecting and verifying HQ II information.

Text from AVI-6_Have_Quick_and_KY-58_page_9.jpeg:
Word-of-Day (WOD)

The WOD is a set of coded numbers in the form of six UHF frequencies
called WOD elements that initialize the radio for HQ. Elements of the
WOD determine the frequencies, hop rate and hop pattern used during
HQ operations. Both basic HQ and HQ II use the WOD, which may be
transferred to either or both radios through the DTM.

For either version, the aircrew must physically rotate the channel selector
on the radio backwards from channel 20 through 15 to “load” the WOD.
An audible beep is heard on channels 20-16 followed by a double beep as
channel 15 is selected.

Basic HQ (HQ1)

With basic HQ, 6 coded “frequencies,” WOD elements, are preset in
normal channels 15-20. The WOD element in channel 20 is used to
initialize the radio for HQ operation. The WOD elements in channels
15-19 provide specific operating information. All six elements must be
loaded to the radio to “load the WOD.”

The WOD element stored in channel 20 determines what mode the radio
is put in (training or combat) and the rate at which it hops among the
frequencies of the net. To use the training modes of basic HQ or HQ II,
300.0XX must be set as the WOD element in channel 20. The XX can be
00, 25, 50 or 75, and determines the hop rate of the radio.

In the training mode, basic HQ actually hops among the five frequencies
stored in channels 15-19. These five frequencies limit basic HQ to five
training nets. Combat WOD elements are not the actual frequencies
channelized in presets 15-19. They are groups of numbers that provide
codes for HQ combat employment.

The capability of basic HQ to load only one WOD proves to be a limiting
factor. To decrease the likelihood of interruption or jamming by hostile
forces, WOD elements are normally changed every day in combat. Basic
HQ users airborne at 2400Z have to reprogram the WOD elements in
channels 15-19 by rechannelizing with new data and cycling down from
channel 20 to load the new day’s WOD. This is unnecessary in training as
the elements do not change day-to-day.

Ring Laser Gyro

Each RLG is a strapdown system (it does not move). It is a triangular
enclosure pictured in Figure D-2.

Within each RLG, two counter rotating laser beams are reflected around
the triangle using mirrors. When the gyro is at rest, the two beams have
the same frequency showing no acceleration. When the aircraft turns, one
beam has a longer path to travel; the other, a shorter. This causes
changes in the laser light frequencies which are detected by photocells.
The output of the photocells is used to determine angular rate and
direction of rotation used for attitude and navigation computations.

Inertial Navigation Digital Computer

The digital computer uses RLG outputs, along with inputs from
mechanical accelerometers, to calculate accelerations in pitch, roll, and
yaw. It also calculates true heading and magnetic heading vectors. In
addition, the computer provides BITs, computer mode control, and
information to other systems.

The INS’ digital computer has a defense mapping agency (DMA) magnetic
variation look-up table included in its memory. Based on present position,
the INS can determine magnetic variation for any location on earth. This
allows it to output magnetic heading without external inputs, other than a
good starting present position. A Kalman filter is used to provide
enhanced alignment and performance. This is a software program that
keeps track of earth movement, the cycle of mechanical error, past FNU
INS performance, alignment quality, time in the NAV mode, type of
update, and other factors. How much of a position update the filter
accepts is based on known earth rotation values and mechanical error
calculation.

Text from AVI-8_INS_page_13.jpeg:
ALIGNMENT (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

There are three modes of alignment: gyrocompass, stored heading, and
in-flight. All that is required during most missions is turning the INS
knob to GC shortly after the engines are started and to NAV prior to
takeoff. Let us look at the process a little closer to understand what the
system is doing.

Two basic things happen in the time between turning the INS on and
switching to NAV. For the first 30 seconds of an alignment, the system
determines attitude/platform stabilization. The remaining time is used to
determine true north. This whole process is called aligning the INS.

Gyrocompass (GC) Alignment (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

A gyrocompass alignment is the most accurate alignment and the one
most often used. Accuracy specifications call for drift of 0.8 nm per hour
but flight tests have resulted in a calculated error of 0.37 nm per hour.

GC Alignment - Procedure (INS Mode Switch OFF to GC)

Read the Dash 1, Section II, INS Procedures, INS Alignments, Normal GC
Alignment for a complete discussion of GC alignment procedures.

In short, turn the INS control knob to the GC position and insert a present

position through the UFC. Stabilization and true north are established by
the system. After that, select NAV and take off.

D-7 AVI-8


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_14.jpeg:
Alignment Status In The HUD

The status of the INS alignment is displayed above the NAV data block in
the HUD (Figure D-4). During a normal GC alignment, these are the
anticipated indications (provided a present position entry is not needed):

GC NO TAXI
NAV 1A

N 12.0
OFF

AVI-08-04

Figure D - 4. INS Status During Alignment.

GC NOTAXI Indicates a GC coarse alignment has begun. During
this phase, the INS is computing its attitude. The
message lasts for approximately 60 seconds. DO NOT
MOVE THE AIRCRAFT. If movement is detected, the
alignment ceases and the INS must be turned off (at
least 2 seconds) and then restart the alignment.

GC 15.9 An alignment quality number appears on the HUD
display after the INS calculates a level aircraft
attitude. This number represents the relative time of
the alignment where 15.9 = beginning value and
0.8 = nearly complete.

AVI-8 D-8


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_15.jpeg:
GC

GC

HOLD

OK

The aircraft can be moved without degrading INS
accuracy after the alignment quality number appears.
However, when the aircraft is moved or when the
holding brake is disengaged, the message GC HOLD
replaces the alignment quality number as a visual cue
that the alignment has ceased. After the aircraft is
stopped, you must engage the holding brake in order to
continue the alignment. This is commonly referred to
as an interrupted alignment.

As the alignment continues, the quality number counts
down. Once GC 0.8 is displayed, the alignment is
nearing completion. Shortly GC OK will appear. This
indicates that the alignment has reached its specified
tolerances. The INS mode switch can now be moved to
NAV. If NAV is selected prior to the GC OK
indication, INS performance will be degraded. If NAV
is not selected when GC OK appears in the HUD, the
INS will continue refining its alignment and Kalman
filter values.

Interrupted Alignments

By disengaging the holding brake after GC 15.9 is displayed but before GC
OK is displayed, then reengaging it on different aircraft headings, you
help the INS electronically determine true north and true vertical more
accurately. Once GC OK is displayed, no more interrupted aligning is
possible. This is not to be confused with an extended alignment.

D-9 AVI-8


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_16.jpeg:
Extended Alignments

Whenever GC OK is displayed and the holding brake is engaged, the INS
is in an “extended alignment.” This will not degrade the INS accuracy; in
fact, it will improve it by refining values through the Kalman filter
software program. Therefore, selecting INS NAV should be delayed as
long as practical on the ground, and the holding brake should be engaged
every time the aircraft is stopped. Also, INS drift occurs whenever the
holding brake is disengaged and/or the INS is placed in NAV, which is
another good reason to delay these actions.

Present Position Required (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

If the last aircraft shutdown present position differs from the last
alignment present position by more than 2 nm, GC PP REQ is displayed
instead of GC NO TAXI. This shows that the INS needs the current
latitude and longitude. The information must be entered before the
alignment will continue. The new present position needs to be accurate.
If an incorrect latitude is entered, the INS will detect the wrong earth
rotation rate which will cause PP REQ to be displayed. An incorrect
longitude cannot be detected. If you enter it incorrectly, simply type in
the correct coordinates and the INS will continue its alignment, although
it will backstep in the alignment process somewhat. In the FCP, the PP
keeping submenu is displayed automatically on the UFC. In the RCP, the
PP keeping submenu must be selected by pressing PB #4 on the Menu 2
display. Either crew member can input present position, but it is
normally done by the WSO. Read the Dash 1, Section II, UFC Procedures,
Data Entry/Display (Both), Present Position for a complete discussion of
present position entry procedures. For best results, an accurate present
position should be entered on every flight, even if PP REQ is not
displayed.

AVI-8 D-10


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_17.jpeg:
Stored Heading (SH) Alignment (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

A valid stored heading alignment is possible only if a GC alignment was
previously accomplished, the INS control knob was not placed in NAV,
and the aircraft was not moved since the last INS shutdown. The SH
alignment has the same accuracy as the previous GC alignment but only
requires about 40 seconds to complete. True north is electronically stored
so the INS only needs to stabilize and check its accuracy before it is ready
for use. If the present position information is not accurate, the
groundspeed of the previous flight was >3 knots or the error rate of the
previous flight was >1 nm/hr, the INS automatically performs a GC
alignment regardless of the INS knob position.

Stored Heading Alignment - Procedure (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

Read the Dash 1, Section II, INS Procedures, INS Alignments, SH
Alignment for a discussion of SH alignment procedures. Place the INS
knob from OFF to SH. The alignment status is displayed in the HUD.
The expected sequence is as follows:

SH NO TAXI Like GC NO TAXI, it means do not move the
aircraft.
SH 0.8 The system already knows where north is, so only

a check for accuracy and fine corrections are
necessary. The alignment time number starts at
0.8.

SH OK Put the INS mode knob in NAV.

In-flight Alignment (IFA)

IFAs are performed in the unlikely case of an in-flight failure of the INS.

It is a GC alignment done en route in an attempt to recover the INS.
Read the Dash 1, Section III, INS Failure.

DATA ENTRY

You must provide the CC with the coordinates of a point before you can
obtain NAV information. The data is actually stored in the CC and the
calculations are done there. Let us refer to CC and INS interface as “the
system.”

NOTE: Elevation is not required for lateral steering information;
however, it should be entered with each point in the event that an altitude
update is accomplished at any of the sequence points. In order to cue
sensors (A/G radar, TGT IR) accurately, elevation is required.

Sequence Points

For navigation, sequence points are
used to define the route of flight. A
sequence point is a general term
given to five types of route points
that can be entered into the system:
base, steer points, aim points,
target points, and offset points.
Up to three separate routes may be
entered and selected using A, B and
C route identifiers. The letters A, B,
or C are typed after the navigation
point number when entering/
requesting information on a different
route from that currently selected.

The system can store 100 steer
and/or target points using different
letter and number syntax to define
these points. An additional 100 aim
and/or target offsets can be stored
using specific letter and number
syntaxes.

AVI-8 D-12


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_19.jpeg:
Navigation/steering provided in the HUD, ADI, HSI, TSD, A/A radar, A/G
radar, TEWS, UFC, etc., is based on these entries. Automatic sequencing
of these points is provided as the route progresses as long as the aircraft
passes within two nm of the point (with AUTO SEQ selected on the HSI).
For the following description of points (Figure D-5), assume route A is
selected.

Base Point

The present position used by the INS during alignment becomes the base
point. Base is the start and end point for each route (A, B, C). On the
TSD and A/G radar display, the base looks like a baseball home plate with
the letter B above it.

NOTE

If a base point is loaded in the MC/DTM, to ensure the INS entered
present position at alignment is the base point (rather than the MC/DTM
base point), the MC/DTM must be read prior to entering the PP;
otherwise, the base point loaded through the MC/DTM is used.

Steer Point

Steer points are route turn points and make up the basic route to be
flown. They are displayed on the A/G radar and TSD as circles and are
represented as whole numbers (i.e., 1A).

Aim Point

Aim points are associated with steer points or initial points (maximum of
seven per steer point). Normally, they are visual, radar, or IR significant
and help identify the steer point. An aim point is depicted on the TSD and
A/G radar as a segmented circle with its associated steer point number, a
decimal, and number 1-7 (i.e., 1.1A). An aim point associated with an
initial point is shown as a segmented square (i.e., 2.1A).

Effective Date Pages Affected



Text from AVI-8_INS_page_20.jpeg:
Initial Point

An initial point is the last steer point before a target. It is displayed as a
solid square and a whole number (i.e., 2A).

Target Point

Targets are the point of attack. They are displayed as triangles with a
whole number and a decimal point (i.e., 3.A).

Target Offset Point

Offset points are always associated with targets (up to seven per target).
Just like aim points are used to identify steer points, offset points are used
to help identify a target. Offset points are displayed as segmented
triangles with the target’s number, a decimal, and 01-07 (i.e., 4.01A).

Steer points and target points are stored together. Their combined total
may not exceed 100 points. Aim points and target offset points are stored
together and their combined total cannot exceed 100. The total system
maximum is 200 points.

Mark Point

Mark points are reference points which can be entered to “mark” a
particular location for future use. They can only be created by marking
your present position (overfly mark) using the UFC keypad MARK button
or by marking a position using the A/G radar or the TGT IR. Up to 10
mark points can be stored in the CC. “Marks” above the 10 erase previous
mark points to make room for new mark points. They are displayed on
the TSD and A/G radar as » (where X = 1 through 10). Some types of
A/G weapons deliveries also create mark points. Mark points are called
up for steering or UFC display by entering M followed by the mark point
number. The time the mark point was created and its coordinates are
available on the UFC point data submenu.

AVI-8 D-14


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_21.jpeg:
Bullseye Point

Bullseye points are identified by BEX, where X is 1-10. They are created
in the CC by MC/DTM, list point, or manual entry. They are displayed
visually as . Bullseye points are called up on the UFC by entering B (or
BE) and the number. They are used to determine the aircraft position
and/or the position of a sensor cue relative to the bullseye point. Bullseye
information is displayed on the A/G radar, A/A radar, and the TSD.

Avoidance Points

Avoidance points are displayed as a circle on the TSD to delineate areas
that have been designated “no fly” for whatever reason. The UFC entry is
“A” and a number (1-15). These points can be entered by MC/DTM, by list
points, or manually. The radius of the avoidance circle is entered/
displayed on the UFC point data submenu (.99 to 99.0 nm). The AFMSS
can be used to load avoidance points in the DTD planning MC/DTM load
routine.

D-15 AVI-8


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_22.jpeg:
Entry Methods

There are three ways to enter sequence point information into the CC.

Mission Cartridge/Data Transfer Module (MC/DTM)

The easiest method to enter data is viaa MC/DTM. The crew programs
the specifics of the mission into the MC/DTM through the AFMSS and
takes it to the jet. After engine start, the MC/DTM is read into the system
(actually, the CC). Route information is now programmed and it only
needs to be checked for accuracy.

Standard MC/DTM

The next method of entering data is a standard MC/DTM. This is an
AFMSS preprogrammed MC/DTM that has selected list points around the
local area but not a specific route. After engine start, the MC/DTM is
read. Since there is no programmed route, you must define one.

List Point

Reading the MC/DTM puts a list of geographic points (LAT, LONG, and
elevation) into the CC. Generally, the flying organization selects points
that are commonly used as standard list points. Rather than type in the
coordinates of points, use the list point number to define a route. By
selecting a steer, target, aim, or offset point and associating it with a list
point, a route is created using predefined geographic points. There are no
procedures in the Dash 1 for this process.

D-17 AVL8


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_24.jpeg:
Manual Entry

The last method for entering data is to manually enter everything through
the UFC. Manual entry of latitude and longitude is covered in the Dash 1
and in the CBT lesson. The coordinates are typed into the scratchpad and
entered into their appropriate display windows on the UFC point data
submenu.

After navigation information is entered, it should be checked for accuracy.
The easiest technique is to step through the TSD to ensure the points
appear correctly positioned on the map. Once verified, the route is ready
to fly. Additional methods for verifying route information are addressed
in a later lesson.

IN FLIGHT
Taking Off in GC

If you inadvertently takeoff with the INS in GC, do not panic. As long as
GC OK appeared in the HUD before brake release, there should be little

or no degradation in navigation accuracy. There is no apparent problem

changing the switch from GC to NAV while the aircraft is moving.

Auto Sequencing

If AUTO SEQ is selected (boxed) on the HSI, the system automatically
sequences the current steer point to the next steer point under most
conditions. You must pass within two nautical miles of a steer point to get
the system to auto sequence. However, auto sequencing does not take
place when a base, a mark point, or a bullseye point is the selected steer
point. If AUTO SEQ is not selected (unboxed) on the HSI, the system
must be manually sequenced. Other exceptions are addressed in A/G
lessons.

Manual Sequencing
If the system does not automatically sequence to the next steer point,

select it manually. Do this by typing the next steer point number into the
scratchpad and entering it at PB #10 on Data 1 or Menu 1 of the UFC.

Position Updates (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

Although the “system” is extremely accurate, a small amount of drift
exists. You will normally perform position updates to the MN, but the
INS can be updated, as well.

In Suite 3, with the UFC update select submenu, three update methods
are available: the HUD, overfly, and altitude updates. From the update
select menu (Figure D-7), choose the option you intend to use and a
specific submenu appears (Figure D-8, left). EGI updates will be available
after TCTO 1F-15E-737.

Read the Dash 1, Section II, Update Procedures, HUD Update for the
HUD update procedures. In short, be in the NAV or INST master mode;
access the HUD update submenu (Figure D-8, left). Take command of the
HUD (depress/release and toggle forward with the FCP castle switch and
select INS or MN at PB #10). Ensure the steer point is selected, then use
the FCP target designator control (TDC) to slew the line of sight (LOS)

Deltas

The distances (N or S/E or W) from the INS (or MN) PP to the update
derived position (shown under the LOS cue) is shown on the UFC at

PBs #2 and #8 as feet (or miles measured to the nearest tenth if greater
than 3000 feet) N/S and E/W. They are referred to as deltas. Accept the
deltas (and correct the error) by pressing PB #7 (ENTER); reject the deltas
by exiting the submenu or doing another update.

AVI-8 D - 20


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_27.jpeg:
NOTE

The displayed steer point is inhibited from auto sequencing until the
aircrew exits the UFC update menu. This applies to all UFC update
routines.

Overfly Freeze Update (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

Read the Dash 1, Section II, Update Procedures, Overfly Freeze Update,
for update procedures. To perform an overfly freeze, ensure the steer
point is selected and visually fly over the update point. At the moment
you pass overhead, press FREEZE. Assess the deltas to ensure they are
reasonable. To accept the update, press PB #7 (ENTER); to reject, exit the
display. Overfly updates also update “system altitude” if the radar
altimeter is operational and an elevation of the displayed steer point is
present. As in the HUD update, ensure MN or INS is the selected update
source.

Altitude Update (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

Read the Dash 1, Section II, Update Procedures, Altitude Update, for the
update procedure. The altitude the aircraft computes is known as “system
altitude” (SYSB - system baro) and can be updated over a specific
sequence point, or over a surface elevation. Access the altitude update
submenu, select the method of update, freeze, and accept or reject the
delta. Although altitude updates do not apply directly to the INS, it is an
update you will do on every air-to-ground mission. A further discussion of
system altitude update implications will be provided during the surface
attack academic block.

Radar/IR Updates

It is also possible to update the INS/MN position using the TGT IR and/or
the air-to-ground radar. These topics are covered in specific lessons later
in the course.

D-21 AVL-8


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_28.jpeg:
After Landing Overfly Freeze (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

After taxiing back to a known position (parking spot, arming area spot,
etc.), an overfly update of the INS must be performed to enter the
mission’s INS data. This is how a history of the INS performance is
maintained by the central computer. Doing an overfly freeze update after
landing does not significantly improve INS performance on future flights,
but it does develop a history for maintenance troubleshooting.

Considerations for INS/MN Updates

1. A position update to the INS updates the MN, as well. A position
update to the MN does not update the INS.

2. If during the UFC-accessed updates, either crew member leaves the
UFC update format displayed, the steering will not auto sequence to

the next point.

3. If an update is to be performed to the INS, INS must be selected as
the PP-keeping source (or INV will likely be displayed for deltas).

AVI-8 D - 22


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_29.jpeg:
INS MALFUNCTIONS
Excessive Ground Speed/Position Errors

After selecting NAV, you should look at your ground speed and present
position prior to takeoff. Ground speed errors greater than 6 kts and
position errors greater than 2 nm are excessive. Lesser values should be
considered excessive for air-to-ground missions. Attempt another
alignment by going to off for 5 seconds then back to GC align. Allow the
INS to remain in GC align as long as possible. Monitor ground speed and
present position to assess system accuracy for one minute after selecting
NAV again.

Backup Systems (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

Although an INS failure seriously degrades mission capability, backup
systems easily permit safe recovery of the aircraft. The INS is backed up
by the attitude heading reference system (AHRS) for attitude and
magnetic heading information. The mission navigator (MN), a subroutine
of the central computer, keeps its own constant present position, and is
used for sensor positioning and weapons release data. In addition to these
backup systems, an in-flight alignment can be performed; and, if
maintained for 20 minutes, the INS may reflect original alignment
accuracy. Realize that an insidious failure could cause a position error
leading to an off course situation or missed target or TOT. All systems
must be continually cross-checked against others.

General Indications of INS Failure (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

If the INS fails completely, the MASTER CAUTION light illuminates and
ATTITUDE appears as an MPD/MPCD caution. The AV BIT caution light
illuminates and INS will be displayed in the BIT display failure window.
The system should automatically switch over to the air data (A/D) mode
and use AHRS attitude and heading information along with UFC entered
winds and magnetic variation to compute present position and steering
cues in the MN. The ATTITUDE caution only comes on for a major failure
of the INS (or AHRS). Indications of a partial failure appears in other
locations. If the built-in test (BIT) function detects a failure in the INS,
INS appears on the BIT display (MPD/MPCD) in the equipment failure
window, and the AV BIT light comes on.

HUD Indications of INS Failure (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

If the INS fails completely and the system successfully switches over to
the AHRS, one indication in the HUD is a blinking (one hertz rate)
velocity vector. NAV DEGD is displayed in the navigation information
block. If INS heading and/or velocity information is in error, the velocity
vector may also blink. If both the AHRS and INS have failed (or the
attitude/heading reference selected on the ADI is invalid), the heading
scale indicates OFF and the pitch ladder disappears. All NAV data blocks
display OFF. Current G will be supplied by the flight control
accelerometers, but OWS max allowable G will be OFF. The velocity
vector will disappear as will the bank indices (Figure D-11).

ADI Indications of INS Failure (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

The attitude information for the aircraft automatically changes to AHRS
and the only indication on the ADI is that INS is replaced by AHRS at
PB #5. If you cycle PB #5 back to INS, the ADI displays a break X across
the attitude ball and INS OFF appears at PB #5 (attitude source
indication). Heading information will still come from the AHRS, if it is
operational. IF both INS and AHRS fail, the ADI displays a break X and
the heading scale displays OFF, no matter which system is selected.

HSI Indications of INS Failure (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

If the INS fails completely with the AHRS operational, and the system
switches to the A/D mode, all HSI indications will appear to be normal,
but will be supplied through the air data navigation mode. If only INS
heading information is bad, HSI heading will be supplied by the AHRS. If
both INS and AHRS have failed, OFF appears in the NAV data block and
TCN data block. The NAV pointer disappears. The compass card slaves
to north and freezes, and the lubber line, heading marker, and captain's
bars disappear. The TACAN pointer will show relative bearing only, just
like ADF. TACAN DME will also be available, but OFF will be displayed
in the bearing block.

In-Flight Alignment (IFA) (Before TCTO 1F-15E-737)

Read the Dash 1, Section II, INS Failure, INS In-Flight Alignment for a
discussion of in-flight alignment procedures. Although INS failure is
unlikely, it is possible. If the INS fails while airborne, an in-flight
alignment may be required. It is extremely critical that you precondition
the AHRS and mission navigator. The AHRS must have good heading
and attitude information and the A/D system have a good present position
before starting the IFA, or alignment time will be increased significantly.
A full IFA requires 20 minutes and three to five high accuracy position
updates. Precision velocity updates (PVUs) are accomplished by using the
A/G radar, and position updates by using the targeting IR, A/G radar,
HUD, or overfly. It is best to leave the A/G radar in IFA as long as
possible to supply ground speed and drift angle (PVU) information.

INS is computing its attitude. The message lasts for
approximately 60 seconds. DO NOT MOVE THE AIRCRAFT.
This message displays if the present position is not OK. PP
must be entered for the NAV alignment to continue.

An alignment quality number represents the relative time of the
alignment. 15.9 = beginning value; 0.8 = nearly complete.

The aircraft is moved after the alignment quality number
appeared. If the aircraft is stopped but the parking brake is not
engaged, the INS will not reenter the alignment mode.

This indicates the alignment is complete and the INS mode
switch may be moved to NAV.

ANNEX

Embedded Global Positioning Inertial Navigation System (EGD)

With TCTO 1F-15E-737, a system called the embedded global positioning
inertial navigation system (EGI) replaces the AHRS. The Suite 3 software
recognizes the presence of the EGI and will not display or address AHRS
functions. The EGI provides a more reliable and maintainable source of
attitude and heading information than the AHRS. The EGI will be your
primary source of position and velocity information when it is selected as a
present position keeping source (PPKS), and can provide a full backup for
INS information in the event of an INS failure. The INS will be your
primary navigation source under normal circumstances.

The EGI is very easy to use. Power is automatically applied to the system
when the aircraft is started. It automatically transitions to its align mode
and then to its NAV mode when it is ready.

Global Positioning System (GPS)

GPS is a space-based positioning and time system. Twenty-one navstar
satellites are circling the earth in six orbits. They are positioned 10,000
miles in space and have 12-hour orbits. They are distributed so that at
least four satellites will be in view anywhere on the earth at any given
time. The time system includes coordinated universal time (Zulu time)
available to the user for satellite acquisition.

The GPS network was designed to support a broad segment of users. The
two levels of service developed are the precise positioning service (PPS)
and the standard positioning service (SPS). The PPS system is primarily
for military use and has a higher attainable degree of accuracy than the
SPS.

The GPS uses world geodetic system 1984 (WGS 84) absolute earth
coordinates rather than a ground-based transmitter. As a result, GPS isa
positioning system rather than a navigation system such as TACAN.
Positioning is provided in three dimensions to include vertical
information.

G-1 AVI-8


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_44.jpeg:
The GPS navstar satellites broadcast L-band phase modulated radio
waves. Each satellite transmits its own unique signal enabling the EGI to
tell individual satellites apart. On-board data processors within the EGI
measure the signal and solve a position and time problem to determine
your position.

Weather does not affect the GPS satellite, which was designed to be
serviceable even in a combat environment. The GPS satellite
constellation is in place and has been in use for several years. The USAF

intends to integrate GPS in all aircraft in an effort to eventually replace
TACAN, VOR, and VORTAC systems.

Fighter Navigation Unit (FNU) INS/EGI

The FNU INS is still the primary source of attitude and magnetic heading
information. It provides a backup source of present positioning
information. The EGI will provide the primary source for present
position, velocity, and attitude information. Though the EGI effectively
eliminates the need for the TACAN, the TACAN is still available for
navigation. The EGI replaces the AHRS and integrates GPS data into
existing on-board systems.

Mission Navigator (MN)

The MN is always based on the FNU INS. MN resets will align the MN to
the current FNU INS position. The aircrew can update the MN without
updating the FNU INS.

Best available velocity is based on the present position keeping source
(PPKS). In EGI PPKS, the best available velocity is the position velocity
consistency (PVC) filter velocity. In MN or INS PPKS, the best velocity is
based on INS velocity. The radar will use the best available velocity for
HRM and position keeping.

GPS Almanac

The first time a GPS receiver is operated, it must begin a search for
satellite signals. A GPS constellation almanac providing position and
approximate time facilitates this search. Almanac data gives orbit
parameters for each satellite and may be valid for periods up to 180 days.
The almanac data is used to predict satellite visibility and range, thereby
narrowing the GPS receiver search window.

AVI-8 G-2


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_45.jpeg:
Once the first satellite is acquired, a current almanac can be obtained
from the satellite’s NAV message. It takes up to 12’ minutes to collect
complete almanac data which can be obtained from any GPS satellite.

The AFMSS adds a GPS data almanac to the CC initialization
subdirectory. Only stored almanac data is provided by AFMSS on the
MC/DTM. The MC/DTM is read to the CC and is available to the EGI
during initialization. Current almanac data changes weekly and is
written to the MC/DTM on a postflight write. When the postflight
MC/DTM is installed in AFMSS for debriefing, AFMSS is automatically
updated.

The EGI stores almanac data if it maintains good battery function. Ifthe
battery fails, MC/DTM almanac data is required. If that data is not the
current week’s almanac, the EGI will replace it with almanac data
acquired from the satellite. Satellite acquisition is fairly rapid but can
take up to 30 minutes if almanac data is more than a week old. Almanac
currency directly affects acquisition time.

EGI

The EGI is a navigation platform that combines an inertial sensor
assembly with a GPS receiver and a Kalman filter.

The EGI inertial sensor assembly is combined with inertial electronics to
process gyro and accelerometer information for computing north/south/
east/west; vertical velocities and acceleration; X/Y/Z axis velocities and
accelerations; and pitch, roll, magnetic heading, and time heading. It
contains circuits for calculating inertial altitude, latitude, longitude, and
computer signals for gyro compass and stored heading alignments.

The EGI GPS receiver processes signals from space-based satellites by
tracking them to accurately measure aircraft position, velocity, and time
to aid in aircraft positioning. The more accurate data provided by the EGI
enhances navigation, sensor cueing, target acquisition, and weapons
delivery.

A Kalman filter is added to accurately model and weigh errors in velocity,
position, and calibration for enhanced performance.

G-3 AVI-8


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_46.jpeg:
The EGI’s inertial sensor, GPS receiver, and Kalman filter are combined
to calculate a blended EGI solution for present position, velocity, and
altitude. Three or more satellites are required for the best EGI blended
solution.

EGI Alignment

The EGI is automatically powered up when the aircraft generators come
on-line. There are no published aircrew procedures required for EGI
alignment.

The EGI alignment modes are as follows:

GC align 4 minutes - requires PP from CC or FNU INS. The PP
stored in the FNU INS is sent to the EGI when FNU
INS is placed in GC.

SH align 30 seconds - this requires a full EGI GC alignment

prior to shutting down the EGI from the previous
flight and the aircraft heading not changed prior to
next power up

In motion align aircraft is in motion during align. Must be
(IMA) tracking satellites and may take up to 10 minutes

to complete.

EGI Shutdown

An orderly shutdown is required for optimum performance. The CC issues
the EGI an off command when the FNU INS is turned off after flight.

This assumes the aircraft exceeded 80 kts, went from weight on wheels to
weight off wheels, and back to weight on wheels. A FNU INS overfly
update is then performed prior to shutting off the INS. The EGI stores
the performance monitor data and initialization data for the next power
up. This takes about 10 seconds. The EGI then begins a GC alignment.
Completion of the GC alignment is not required unless a SH alignment is
desired.

AVI-8 G-4


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_47.jpeg:
EGI Performance Monitor

The EGI performance monitor keeps a history of recent alignments and
navigation data. This is stored on the basis of completed flights. This
history requires:

@ airspeed greater than 80 kts

e EGI in NAV mode for 30 minutes

e EGI receives FNU INS overfly update at the end of the flight

e FNU INS turned off

This data is stored in nonvolatile memory if you allow 30 seconds from
FNU INS shutdown to the time engines are shut down.

EGI GC Alignment

The GC alignment is the most accurate alignment mode. It takes four
minutes from the time both generators come on-line to complete the
alignment. The alignment requires a present position (PP) input to the
EGI from the CC or GPS. The CC initially sends a PP stored in the FNU
INS at power up and again if a PP is entered into the FNU INS from the
UFC. If the EGI keys are verified and the GPS is tracking four satellites,
the EGI will take the PP from the GPS. This will then replace the entered
PP.

EGI Stored Heading (SH)

The EGI stored heading mode is a fast alignment mode. It takes 30
seconds to complete and does not require a PP entry. To perform a SH
alignment, a full EGI GC alignment must have been completed prior to
last shutdown and the aircraft heading should not have been moved more
than 1°. Once the EGI has been set up for a SH alignment, it will
continue to do so on each power up until the aircraft has moved, or a PP is
entered that is more than 900 feet from current PP.

G-5 AVI-8


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_48.jpeg:
EGI IMA

If the aircraft moves or goes weight off wheels during alignment, the EGI
will do an IMA. This can take up to 10 minutes and may require
assistance from the GPS. A heading change during the first few minutes
of an IMA may speed up the alignment.

“Y” Code

The military precise positioning service (PPS) is accessible with the EGI.
PPS is enhanced by an encrypted mode referred to as “Y” code. An
encryption key is installed in the EGI using a KYK-13 at a specialized
crypto fill port in the EGI LRU.

The CC commands the EGI to use the “Y” code. If the EGI does not track
a “Y” code for more than a 5 minute period or the EGI is unkeyed, the CC
will command the EGI to stop using GPS in the blended solution. An
additional option, NON Y code, will become available and can be selected
on the detail page. EGI* will be displayed in the BIT fault window along
with an AV BIT light to alert the crew to this situation.

Boxing NON Y on the detail page will allow the crew to use GPS in the
blended solution with noncoded signals. If “Y” code again becomes
available, the GPS will track “Y” code satellites with no aircrew action.
The NON Y display will be removed from the detail page when this
happens. If the NON Y display should reappear, reboxing is all that is
required to use noncoded GPS signals again.

Time of Day (TOD)

Not to be confused with Have Quick TOD, the EGI uses a TOD in Zulu
time to aid in satellite tracking and aircraft positioning. If the EGI has
had a battery change, TOD time and date must be entered to decrease
satellite acquisition time.

TOD date entries are made via the UFC HUD title page at PB #1. The

date is entered as M1-1 through M12-31 for month and day entries. If the
month is unchanged, M1 through M31 is required to change the day entry.

AVI-8 G-6


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_49.jpeg:
Zulu time entries are made via the UFC Data 1 at PB #8. The Zulu time
is entered as M000000 through M235959. All six digits must be entered.

Upon power up or CC reset with weight on wheels, the time of day buffer
(TODB) and real time clocks (RTCs) are initialized to GPS time if GPS
time is valid. If GPS time is not valid, the TODB is initialized to RTC. If
GPS time should then become valid before an aircrew time entry, the GPS
time will initialize the TODB and RTC.

If GPS time should become valid after aircrew entry, GPS time will be
loaded to the TODB and RTC but will not change the crew-entered CC
time.

Initializing the TODB and RTC with GPS time sets them to Zulu time.
Your position from the satellite is based on time of arrival ranging.
Synchronization between the GPS time and on-board TODB and RTC
times are essential. A comparison is made from the time a signal is sent
to when the EGI receives it. This time difference will give the range to the
tracked satellite. With four satellites, very accurate positioning can be
determined.

Blended GPS/INS

The EGI is a separate entity from the FNU INS and operates differently
in its aircraft positioning solution. The EGI combines GPS and inertial
sensor information to build a blended solution. The EGI blended solution
uses GPS satellite range measurement and inertial sensor measurement
to provide an EGI blended horizontal position, velocity, and altitude.
Position accuracy is 30 feet circular error of probability (CEP) and velocity
accuracy of 0.34 fps.

The EGI blended solution is always used within the EGI even when GPS
is unavailable for some reason. If GPS aiding is lost for short periods, the
Kalman filter for the EGI is adjusted to reduce inertial sensor errors. This
will be more accurate than a free inertial-only solution. However, if GPS
aiding is absent for more than 30 minutes, the EGI solution will generally
contain larger errors than the FNU INS solution. The EGI solution
cannot be updated in position or velocity to correct errors as you can with
the FNU INS.

Selection of PPKS is made at PB #10 on the PPKS submenu (Figure G-1).
The possible selections are EGI, INS, and MN, with INS as the power up
default. The actual PPKS is displayed at PB #1 on the submenu

(Figure G-1).

When EGI is the PPKS, the keying and GPS aiding status is displayed at
PB #1. The leading “K” means the EGI is keyed and keys are verified.
When a trailing asterisk (*) is present, the blended solution is being
improved with GPS information. The asterisk (*) will not be displayed if
the EGI is tracking less than four satellites for more than five minutes or
if the horizontal position error is greater than 120 feet for more than five
minutes (PB #8, Figure G-1). At PB #8 and #9 (Figure G-1), horizontal
(H) and vertical (V) position errors are displayed. If the EGI is in an align
mode or invalid, INV will be displayed rather than the errors. In all other
PPKS (INS/MN) PB #8 and #9 will be blank.

If the EGI is in NAV mode, the blended estimated spherical position error
will be displayed at PB #7 on Menu 2 (Figure G-1). If EGI is in align
mode, ALN will be placed in the PB #7 data block. If the EGI is off or
invalid, INV will be displayed at PB #7.

EGI Updates

The UFC update menu has been modified to delete TACAN as a position
update source. EGI replaces TACAN at PB #7 (Figure G-2). MN PP RST
will reset MN position to FNU INS unless FNU INS is invalid. If this is
the case, a MN RST cannot be done.

System altitude resets are coupled with the PPKS and are referred to as
SYSG (EGI) and SYSB (INS/MN). SYS ALT reset at PB #2 will display
SYSGXXXX or SYSBXXXxX for five seconds if reset occurred. Only the
system altitude in use will be reset. INV will be displayed for five seconds
if the reset did not occur.

EGI Position Updates

The EGI cannot be updated in position or velocity. The EGI does not
provide data to the FNU INS or MN in a periodic aided fashion.

To update the FNU INS, INS must be selected as the PPKS. The update
is a Kalman weighed update. When the FNU INS is updated, the MN is
also updated (Figure G-3).

The MN position can be updated in any PPKS and will accept 100% of the
update.

The EGI UFC update menu is used to perform a one-shot position update
from the EGI to the FNU INS or MN.

PB #2 and #8 will display N/S/E/W errors between FNU INS/MN and the
EGI. PB #4 can be toggled to provide an altitude update. If the field at
PB #4 is blank, only a position update in latitude and longitude will be
accomplished. The FNU INS must be the PPKS in order to update the
INS position.

Velocity Updates

MN and FNU INS PVUs can be performed in any PPKS. The EGI
velocity, however, is never used to update the FNU INS or MN velocities.

In EGI PPKS, the CC will send a velocity correction to the radar. The
velocity correction is the difference between EGI velocities and reference
velocities. The reference velocity source can only be FNU INS or ADP.

PVUs are not required prior to constructing HRM patch maps if in EGI
PPKS. If MN is the PPKS, it is still recommended to do a PVU before
making a HRM patch map.

Altitude Updates

SYSG cannot be updated from any source. If in EGI PPKS, altitude
updates are not allowed. Altitude updates from overfly update or the
targeting pod will be allowed in any PPKS; however, only SYSB will be
updated. After takeoff, if SYSB altitude is in error an update is preferable
to areset. Corruption of SYSB is really the only reason to consider an
altitude update.

G-11 AVI-8

Malfunctions

The FNU INS provides primary altitude and/or magnetic heading to the
EHSI, EADI, and the HUD. The EGI is the backup source for magnetic
heading to the EHSI, EADI, and HUD if the FNU INS should fail. If the
FNU INS fails, the EGI will provide altitude source information to the
EADI and HUD.

If the EGI is the PPKS (i.e., KEGI) with a FNU INS failure, the EGI will
drive the now flashing velocity vector. If any other PPKS is selected, the
ADP will drive the velocity vector if airspeed exceeds 80 kts.

The attitude source can be toggled between INS and EGI on the EADI.
The INS is the default mode. The EGI will be the default in case of FNU
INS failure. If the EGI is in an align mode or invalid, a break X will
appear on the EADI and OFF will be displayed in place of EGI at PB #5.

If the EGI keys are unverified after 20 minutes (indicated by EGI* in the
BIT fault window and KEY IN PROGRESS on the EGI detail page),
NON Y should be available and selected. Key verification may take an
additional 15 minutes.

Air Data (A/D) Mode Malfunction

The A/D mode is a backup to the FNU INS navigation mode. If the INS
should fail, the CC automatically switches to the A/D mode. The CC uses
true airspeed, wind velocity, and EGI heading to determine position and
compute steering information. The A/D is not manually selectable. You

may accomplish PVUs to update velocities. The most accurate position
updates are EGI, HRM, LANTIRN, and OFLY.

AVI-8 G-12


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_55.jpeg:
FNU INS In-flight Alignment (IFA)

Turn the INS knob to OFF then directly to NAV and select IFA on the A/G
PVU display. The FNU INS enters IFA mode and receives attitude and
heading from the EGI. Initial position and velocity are PPKS dependent.
EGI should be the PPKS selection.

In the HUD window you should see IFA 15.9 rather than INS DEGRD,
and a countdown begins. Limit maneuvering to +45° pitch and +60° of roll
during the IFA. You should accomplish three to five position updates
using overfly and LANTIRN as the preferred methods. In 20 minutes you
should see IFA OK in the HUD. To stop the IFA, deselect IFA anytime
after IFA 15.9 is displayed.

Built-in Test (BIT)

The EGI, like other avionics systems, has a BIT system to provide
information pertaining to the EGI operating status. The three BIT
routines are power up, continuous, and ground initiated.

The EGI power up BIT (PBIT) is automatically initiated at aircraft power
up. If the system or components fail during the BIT, EGI* will be
displayed in the BIT fault window and an AV BIT light will be displayed
(Figure G-4). This is also the indication that nonkeyed NON Y is
available on the EGI detail page (Figure G-4).

INTRODUCTION

The F-15E is the first production fighter aircraft to fly with a ring laser
gyro (RLG) inertial navigation system (INS) as standard equipment. The
goal of the RLG INS is to utilize the accuracy and reliability experienced
in commercial RLG INSs, add features to compensate for the dynamic
fighter environment, and provide the aircrew with an accurate and easy to
use navigation tool. The result is an INS that the F-15E pilot turns on,
allows to align for 4 minutes, and virtually forgets until the end of the
mission. The benefits of an RLG versus an analog INS are shown in the
comparison chart (Chart D-1) below:

RLG INS Analog INS
Align Time Full Align (GC) - 4 min Full Align - 9-13 min
Rapid Align (SH) - 40 sec Rapid Align - 3 min
Accuracy 0.8 nm/hr CEP” (design) 2 nm/hr CEP*
Reliability 2000 hrs MTBF** <200 hrs MTBF**

* Circular error probable
** Mean time between failure

NOTE

Actual RLG CEP: approximately 0.37 nm/hr.

Description

The data in this workbook reflects Suite 3 software changes before
TCTO 1F-15E-737. After this TCTO, an embedded global positioning
system (EGI) will replace the current AHRS functions and add to the
reliability and accuracy of on-board position keeping and navigation
systems. Information on the EGI is located in Annex H. The F-15E
fighter navigation unit (FNU) INS will be referred to as the FNU INS or
INS when appropriate and is a separate system from the EGI. The FNU
INS is a self-contained, fully automatic RLG system that supplies the
primary attitude reference for the aircraft, plus provides continuous
present position (PP) monitoring. It also furnishes the LANTIRN, radar,
AFCS, and central computer (CC) systems with aircraft attitude, heading,
velocity, and acceleration information.

Components

The INS consists of three main components. They are the fighter
navigation unit (FNU) mount, the FNU battery, and the inertial sensor
assembly.

FNU Mount

The FNU mount is installed and boresighted in the aircraft prior to

delivery. It has no moving parts and is the location for the following
components.

AVI-8 D-2


Text from AVI-8_INS_page_9.jpeg:
FNU Battery

The battery (Figure D-1) provides power during brief power interruptions.
On the ground, the battery can sustain a two second interruption. In the
air, specifications require it to provide seven seconds of power. (If fully
charged, the battery may last 1-1/2 - 2 minutes.)

Inertial Sensor Assembly (ISA)

The ISA (Figure D-1) contains three complete ring laser gyros (roll, pitch,
and yaw), three analog accelerometers, and the inertial navigation digital

computer.

Introduction to the Display

Figure D-2 shows a very small portion of preplanned route A, target 8.A
and offset point 8.01A. Annotated on the diagram are several of the
symbols that you may see while using the TSD. More symbols are shown
in other figures. The route is entered either manually through the UFC
point data submenu or via the DTM. The range markers, both along track
and cross track, simply provide the user with visual cues to judge the
distance relationship between map geographic points and the aircraft
present position.

The groundspeed (GS) and bank angle (BA) selections at PB #5 and PB
#4, respectively, allow computation and display of a route course line
adjusted for planned aircraft turn radius. GS selections are 0, 420, 450,
480, 510, 540, 570 and 600. If 0 is selected, turn radius is not displayed
(i.e., the route turn points are connected by straight lines). Any BA and
GS selection other than zero provides the appropriate turn radii and
magnetic ground track from point to point. The groundspeed and bank
angle options are only available when the route at PB #9 matches the
route at PB #10 on the UFC Menu 1 or Data 1 display (e.g. current
aircraft route). BA is selectable on all TSD scales and is used to make
calculations such as ETA/ETE. BA selections are 30°, 45° and 60°.

Display Controls

In order to use the TSD controls and HOTAS, you must be in command of
the display (Figure D-3). A “SYSTEM IN USE” cue is displayed if a crew
member attempts to take command while the other is slewing a sensor cue

or commanding a sensor to the cue position (all through HOTAS action).

PB #1 causes avoidance point rings to be displayed or removed from the
TSD. RING is boxed when selected and the rings are displayed. The

avoidance points are automatically displayed (regardless of whether RING
is boxed or unboxed) if loaded for the route. Button numbers 2-3 have no

control function on this display.

With CTR selected, the aircraft symbol is positioned in the
middle of the display. BOT displays 75% of the selected
range in front of the aircraft. The maximum range that can

be displayed in front of the aircraft is 60 nm, using an 80 nm
display with BOT selected. The maximum range that can be

displayed behind the aircraft is 40 nm, on an 80 nm display

with CTR selected.

PB #7 selects the sensor for cueing, either A/G radar or
targeting IR. When either one is selected, its
corresponding cue symbol is displayed at the end of the
range and bearing line. The range and bearing line is
controlled by the TDC. The sensor cue position
(azimuth and range) is displayed in the upper left
corner of the display.

The term FLIR (forward looking infrared) can be
confusing as it is occasionally used interchangeably
with the night visual system (NAV FLIR) and
targeting IR. FLIR on the TSD always refers to the
targeting IR. Sensor selection is “HOTASable” in the
rear cockpit with the castle switch; it is not
“HOTASable” in the front cockpit. HOTAS will be
described later in this workbook.

HRM patch maps are normally commanded from

the A/G radar display. However, they can be
commanded from the TSD. PB #8 selects and displays
the HRM patch map display window. Display window
(DW) size is “HOTASable” in both cockpits with the
auto acq switch. The sizes available are 1.3, 3.3, 4.7
and 10.0 nm. A 0.67 HRM DW can be selected on the
air-to-ground radar display, but not from the TSD.

The system does not allow an HRM patch map to be
made of the entire display, i.e., to get a map of 10.0 nm
square, at least 20 nm range must be displayed on the
TSD. The other limitation imposed is that a 1.3 map
can only be commanded from 3.4 to 39.33 nm from the
aircraft, a 3.3 map from 4.4 to 48.65 nm, and a 4.7 map
from 5.2 to 77.65 nm. Within 8° of the nose and
outside of 60° from the aircraft ground track, a patch
map cannot be made (exclusion zone). An “X” appears
in the display window if any of the above limitations
exist. HRM patch mapping will be covered in later
lessons.

PB #9 displays the route selection. This button can be
cycled through routes A, B and C. There is no
requirement to have the TSD route match the current
INS/MN route. This means the B route could be
displayed showing the outline of a MOA or restricted
area while the INS/MN is providing steering to a

After selection, the TDC is used to center the “X” symbol within the test
frame video. The X symbol is stationary while the test frame grid + moves
by inputs from the TDC. The TSD BIAS should be checked on every flight
to ensure aircraft position, sensor cueing, steer point and course line
symbology is correctly overlaid on the map.

The code in the upper right quadrant, 111b in Figure D-4, indicates which
RMR filmstrip is loaded.

RECAL: Map video calibration can be accomplished by selecting
RECAL at PB #6. When boxed, a 60-second cycle
begins. TSD routes and overlays are displayed;
however, no map will be displayed. RECAL is not
normally selected since map calibration is automatic at
power up. If the map is not clear, select RECAL to
initiate another calibration.

PP:

The legend below PB #17 normally shows PP (present
position). The PP format always displays the aircraft symbol
in the BOT or CTR position and displays the selected route
steer points in sequence (provided the range displayed is
adequate). PB #17 is used to select any point for TSD
navigation route look ahead. The first depression, with a
blank scratchpad, will display the first point on the route.
Each subsequent depression displays the follow-on route
points in order. When look ahead is selected, all points are
presented in the center of a north-up display, and the selected
point number is displayed below PB #17. The range scale
may be changed and will remain at the last setting until
changed again. Also, the aircraft symbol is removed from the
display (Figure D-6). In the look ahead display, the sensor
cue range and bearing line will originate from the direction of
the aircraft (i.e., the tail points back to the A/C). The look
ahead function is “HOTASable” with the FCP coolie and the
RCP castle switches. Coolie “up” in FCP or castle switch
“down” in RCP selects the look ahead function starting at the
first route sequence point.

HOTAS Controls

In addition to the controls around the MPD/MPCD, there are several
controls located on the FCP stick and throttles as well as the RCP hand
controllers.

FCP Stick

The auto acquisition switch (Figure D-12) is the only stick-mounted
HOTAS control for the TSD. It controls the HRM display window (radar
footprint) size. Moving the switch forward reduces the size and moving it
aft increases the size. The size of the footprint determines the size of the
HRM patch map when commanded.

Depressing the auto acq switch returns the TSD to a present position

The coolie switch is a four position switch located

on the inboard front corner of the right throttle. Only
one switch position is used for the TSD. Moving the
coolie switch up (quick step) steps to the first
sequence point (look ahead format).

Just outboard of the coolie switch is the TDC. It
slews the sensor cue at the end of a range and
bearing line. Pressure on the TDC moves the cue
left, right, out (up on the display), or in (down on the
display). When the TDC is pressed and released, it
commands the sensor (radar/TGT IR) to slew to the
point defined by the sensor cue (hand-off).

This switch works like the FCP throttle TDC switch. It
slews the sensor cue; it does not, however, hand-off.

This switch works like the FCP throttle laser fire switch;
at the first detent, it commands TSD sensor cue point
tracking. It also works like the front TDC; at the second
detent, it commands hand-off of the sensor. Depending on
the sensor selection on the TSD, hand-off means the TGT
IR slaves to the cue position or the A/G radar starts patch
mapping at the cue position.

This three position switch works exactly like the
FCP auto acq switch for TSD. Forward commands a
smaller DW size. Aft commands a larger DW size.
Depress (down) commands return from a look ahead
display to a present position display.

Pushing down on the castle switch (quick step) selects
look ahead to the first sequence point, just as the coolie
switch on the FCP throttle does. Moving the castle switch
forward decreases the map range scale and moving it aft
increases the map range scale. Moving the castle switch
to the left toggles between the radar and the targeting IR
sensor cue. The front cockpit has no HOTAS control for
changing from one sensor to the other.

Remote Map Reader (RMR)
Location

The remote map reader is located in the rear cockpit, on the right console
(Figure D-15).

Type Film

The RMR generates a color moving map video signal from aeronautical
chart data reproduced on 35mm filmstrips. Currently, there is film for
virtually all continental U.S. locations. (The film cassette is loaded and
can be changed in flight). One cassette covers a geographic area large
enough for almost any mission (e.g., Seymour Johnson to the west coast
on a single cassette).

Radar

High Resolution Map

In the discussion so far, all references to A/G radar hand-off have meant
the high resolution map (HRM) patch mapping mode. This very high
quality ground mapping operation can produce resolutions as fine as 8.5
feet on patch maps constructed from as far away as 39.33 nm.

The high resolution map can be interfaced through the TSD to make a
“patch map” of a specific area.

Real Beam Map

The RBM scan pattern is displayed on the TSD screen either as a wedge
or baseball home plate shape originating from the aircraft present
position.

If less than a full sweep is selected at PB #9 (on the A/G radar display),
the scan pattern will appear on the TSD as a “V” centered on the A/G
radar cursor.

When RBM is deselected on the A/G radar display, the wedge, baseball

home plate or “V” shape will remain displayed on the TSD at the last
position displayed.

Targeting IR

The targeting IR is a weapons delivery related system. This system can
be cued from the TSD to a line of sight for a specific geographic coordinate
location (viewed on the TSD map).

Upfront Control

The upfront control interacts with the TSD by enabling the crew members
to directly select look ahead points. By typing a point identification on the
scratchpad, and then pushing PB #17 on the TSD, that point will appear
centered on the TSD in a north-up format.

Inertial Navigation System (INS) / Embedded GPS/INS (EGI)

The INS or EGI provides aircraft attitude, heading, velocity and
acceleration information to (among other systems) the CC. With INS
selected as the present position source, the CC uses INS data to place the
aircraft symbol (INS present position) and sequence points on the TSD.
With EGI as the present position keeping source, the CC uses EGI data to
place the aircraft position and sequence points. The CC also uses
INS/EGI data to cue the A/G radar/targeting IR to the position selected on
the TSD (radar display window cue, targeting IR cue). Once the sensor is
cued, the sensor position is maintained by the CC using MN data, if INS is
the PPKS or EGI data if EGI is the PPKS.

Mission Navigator (MN)

The mission navigator is the central computer routine that maintains
aircraft present position independent of the INS or EGI. With MN
selected as the present position source, the CC uses MN data to place the
TSD symbology.

TSD Format With CC Failure

With CC failure the TSD/RMR format (Figure D-16) loses target and
cursor related functions. It continues to provide all primary status cues.
Two selectable parameters remain: map scale selection and INS position
update. With CC failure, the INS can be updated by first calling up the
UFC point data submenu and entering the new point and its lat/long.
Then overfly the point and press PB #16 (O/F UPDT) on the TSD display
to accomplish the update. This procedure updates the INS directly (no
Kalmann filtering), so exercise caution when using it.

COMPONENTS AND CONTROLS

The Tactical Situation Display (TSD) is a presentation of your aircraft
position in relation to a planned mission route, which has been
superimposed over a moving map format. Its primary function is to
display the planned navigation information. However, it also provides
sensor positioning/control information to the crew.

The TSD is composed of an MPD/MPCD display; hands on controls
(throttles/stick/controllers), commonly referred as HOTAS controls; and a
remote map reader (RMR) for the color moving map reproduced on 35mm
film strips. In the future, the RMR will be replaced by the digital map
system.

Multipurpose Display/Multipurpose Color Display (MPD/MPCD)

The TSD is selected by pressing PB #5 on the Menu 1 display (Figure D-1)
and is presented on either the MPD or the MPCD. Whether a color
display or monochromatic display is used is dependent on both the
situation and personal preference. At night the MPCD display can be too
bright, so some crew members put the TSD display on an MPD. Other
considerations for TSD placement include proximity to other displays such
as A/G radar or TF E-scope, type of mission and phase of flight. The
bottom line is that optimum TSD placement is dependent on a variety of
factors.

Symbology

There are several navigation symbols displayed on the TSD. Their
positions relative to the aircraft symbol and the moving map are INS or
MN determined depending on the present position keeping source. The
term “sequence points” is used in describing the F-15E navigation
symbols. This term is used to define a set of geographical points that can
be overflown or used for sensor cueing. The following is a discussion of
sequence points and symbology.

Steer points are defined geographical points that comprise the route to be flown.
They are labeled with whole numbers. Steer point circles are all the same size.
The circular symbol is also used to denote avoid or no-fly areas on the TSD. The
avoidance rings are variable in size according to radius data for each ring
loaded by DTM or at PB #9 on the point data submenu. Radii may be .9 to 99.9
nm. Avoidance rings will have the appropriate avoidance point number in the
center to show the center of the ring. Avoidance points are preceded by an “A”
prefix. Fifteen avoidance point rings may be loaded per route. Five avoidance
points/rings may be displayed at any one time on the TSD.

Aim points are associated with steer points. They are sensor significant points
used for off route sensor cueing and position updates. They are labeled with a
steer point number and one decimal place (e.g., 1.1). Each steer point can have
up to seven associated aim points.

Base steer point location.

The point prior to a target point is an initial point (IP). IPs follow the steer
point numbering system.

Aim points associated with IPs are shown as segmented squares. They follow
the same numbering system as aim points associated with steer points.

Target points are labeled by a whole number followed by a decimal point (e.g., 8.
also referred to as target syntax).

Target offset points are sensor significant points associated with target points.
They are labeled with a target point number and a decimal number in
hundredths (e.g., 8.01). Each target can be assigned up to seven different offset
points.

Bullseye (BE) points are used as reference points for bullseye bearing and
range. They may be route dependent or route independent. There is no number
next to the symbol to indicate which bullseye point is being used.

Aircraft present position with magnetic ground track readout. Current aircraft
position is the top intersection of lines (wingline).

Targeting IR cue (arrowhead) on the end of a range and bearing line from
the aircraft symbol to its selected position. The broken line indicates you
are not in command of the TSD.

Air-to-ground (A/G) radar high resolution map (HRM) patch map cue on
the end of a range and bearing line. The box appears square or
trapezoidal depending on display window (DW) size (1.3, 3.3, 4.7, or 10
nm) and range. The DW size corresponds to the size of the HRM patch
map that would result if commanded (e.g., 10 would represent a patch map
10 nm square). The broken line indicates not in command.

When the targeting IR cue or HRM radar cue has a dot attached to it, that
ground position is being point tracked and the cue is stabilized to that set
of coordinates. This function is available even when the aircraft is not
equipped with a targeting IR pod. When a hand-off is commanded (by
HOTAS action), the targeting IR will point at the area indicated by the
sensor cue symbol or the radar will make a patch map of the area enclosed
within the display window. Hand-off can be commanded with or without
point tracking.

The IR or HRM radar cue without the range and bearing line indicates the
targeting IR active LOS or the HRM radar active footprint (patch mapping
position). The active LOS of the sensors may or may not be the same as
that of the range and bearing line (RBL), depending on whether or not
they have been commanded (by switch action) to the RBL cue.

This symbol indicates the active RBM radar search pattern and A/G radar
cursor position. The symbol represents the A/G radar cursor. There is a
wide pattern for a full scan and a narrower pattern for a partial scan.

The HRM cue DW with an “X” in it indicates that the cue is outside the
range and/or azimuth capability of the radar for making patch maps, or
that a DW size/range incompatibility exists (the radar will not make a
patch map of the selected size because that geographical area is too close
or too far relative to aircraft present position). That area is within 8° of
the velocity vector, inside the minimum/outside the maximum range for
selected display window size, or outside the radar gimbal limits (60°).

This symbol indicates a mark point, identified with a whole number above
it. Mark points are loaded by either performing an overfly mark via the
UFC, a radar mark via the A/G radar display, a target IR mark, or an
automatic overfly mark when the weapon release button is depressed, for
an unplanned target. Up to 10 mark points may be displayed on the TSD.

An azimuth and range readout of the HRM radar cue or targeting IR cue is
displayed in the upper left corner. The active LOS of the HRM or the
targeting IR will correspond to the displayed AZ/Rng only if the sensor has
been commanded (through HOTAS action) to the corresponding cue.

Peak power versus average power has important implications for the
burn-through formula. Peak power (Ppk) is the maximum power output
during transmission time. It is expressed in watts or megawatts.
Average power (Pav), usually expressed in watts, is the peak power
distributed over the pulse recurrence time (PRT) (Figure D-3).

With continuous wave radars/jammers, peak power equals the average
power. They are inherently less sensitive to noise jamming techniques.
The average power of a pulsed radar is determined by the radar’s PRT.
This allows a relatively low peak power jammer to overpower a higher
peak power radar.

For a given power output a narrow bandwidth can be jammed at a higher

techniques.

Text from EW-1_Generic_Electronic_Attack_page_12.jpeg:
Barrage Noise

Barrage noise consists of spreading RF energy over a wide band of
frequencies. The purpose of barrage jamming is to defeat a radar with
good frequency agility, or many radars operating on slightly different
frequencies (Figure D-5).

EW-1 D-6


Text from EW-1_Generic_Electronic_Attack_page_13.jpeg:
Fixed Spot Noise

Fixed spot noise is a stationary narrow band of noise. The advantage of
this technique is that all of the jammer’s power is concentrated on a single
frequency (Figure D-6). The main limitation is that a tunable radar can
simply change frequencies and tune away from the noise.

Figure D - 6. Fixed Spot Noise.

D-7 EW-1


Text from EW-1_Generic_Electronic_Attack_page_14.jpeg:
Swept Spot

Swept spot jamming is similar to spot in that the jammer transmits a
single narrow band of noise. This technique sweeps that spot noise
repeatedly over a wide frequency bandwidth (Figure D-7). The result is
that at any instant, a concentrated jamming signal covers one specific
frequency. The sweeping action ensures that the noise repetitively hits
any radar operating in the jammed frequency bands. If the sweep rate is
as fast as the radar processing cycle, the radar perceives the jamming as
continuous and has to contend with the noise.

Figure D - 7. Swept Spot Jamming.

EW-1 D-8


Text from EW-1_Generic_Electronic_Attack_page_15.jpeg:
Responsive Noise/Sweep Lock-On Jammers

Similar to spot noise, responsive noise selectively transmits the jamming
signal on the radar’s transmitted frequency. This requires a more
sophisticated jammer that can read the victim's radar frequency and
immediately generate a spot noise centered on that frequency. This
technique uses a narrow bandwidth of jamming energy avoiding a waste
of power. This technique has the power advantage of a spot noise jammer,
and can tune quickly enough to jam all but the fastest tuning (frequency
agile) radars.

The major disadvantage of both swept spot and responsive noise jammers
is that only a single frequency can be jammed at one time. The use of
several radars operating on different frequencies generally degrades the
capability of these jammers.

Blinking Noise

This technique involves alternate activation and deactivation of the noise
jamming. A typical blink rate would be one off/on cycle per second.
Blinking is generally used in conjunction with another cooperative
platform, and is therefore a common formation EA defense.

The alternating noise actuation is intended to cause guidance
disturbances due to sequential activation of the victim’s tracking and
home on jam (HOJ) features. The technique is primarily targeted against
radar guided missiles. The intent is to cause a wide miss distance, or
guidance to the centroid of multiple jamming sources away from the
intended targets.

D-9 EW-1


Text from EW-1_Generic_Electronic_Attack_page_16.jpeg:
DECEPTION JAMMING

Deception jamming occurs when the jammer radiates, reradiates, alters,
absorbs or reflects the radar pulse for the purpose of misleading the
victim’s radar receiver. There are three basic types of deceptive jamming:
range, velocity and angle.

The main feature that differentiates deceptive jamming from pure noise
jamming is the fact that deceptive jammers repeat a replica of the victim’s
radar signal. The deceptive jammer merely takes the victim’s radar
transmission, modifies it slightly and then retransmits that signal back to
the victim. Deception jamming is designed to take advantage of any
weaknesses in target tracking or impact point calculation to maximize the
miss distance or prevent automatic tracking.

To be effective, the retransmitted signal must match all victim radar
characteristics including frequency, pulse recurrence frequency (PRF),
pulse recurrence interval (PRI), pulse width and scan rate. Because of the
need to exactly replicate the victim radar, deception jammers are much
more complex, but they do not require as much power as a noise jammer.

EW-1 D-10


Text from EW-1_Generic_Electronic_Attack_page_17.jpeg:
Range Deception

False Target Generator

A false target generator operates against a pulse radar in search. This
type of range deception technique relies on the knowledge of the victim’s
radar. The more the jammer can predict the radar's characteristics, the
greater the ability to produce false targets to confuse the victim. If PRF
cannot be predicted and frequency is not known, the jammer is limited to
repeating the victim’s transmitted pulse with some built-in delay that is
interpreted by the processor as an additional target return(s). This
technique causes false targets greater in range than the jammer (Figure
D-8). If PRF and frequency can be predicted, random false targets can be
generated by sending pulses ahead of the target echo to be interpreted as
target returns as well as delaying pulses.

Range Gate Stealer (RGS)

A range gate stealer operates against a pulse radar in track. The jammer
usually receives a pulse, amplifies it and retransmits it with a slight
delay. The technique uses amplitude modification to capture the tracking
range gate and by slowly increasing the time delay, causes the victim to
work with false range information or to break lock entirely (Figure D-9).
If the RGS can predict the next pulse, a modern system could run the
range gate in either direction. This is a major vulnerability of a constant
PRF radar.

Angle Deceivers

Modulated Noise

This jammer alters the amplitude of the jamming output at a frequency
that is related to the scan rate of the tracking radar and creates a phase
difference. This generates a false tracking error signal. High energy
appears in the part of the scan pattern that should receive low energy and
the boresight of the antenna biases toward the false signal (Figure D-10).
The resulting “angle walk off’ causes a conical scan radar to lose sight of
the real target.

Cross Polarization

This EA technique causes false angle track in monopulse tracking
systems. The jammer returns the radar signal with a change in
polarization. Since the intensity of the radar energy received in each
antenna quadrant is dependent on polarization angle, the false change in
polarization leads to antenna angle tracking errors.

Velocity (Doppler) Deception

Velocity Gate Stealer (VGS)

Velocity gate stealers attempt to move the tracking gate off the target
return in the same manner a RGS walks the range gate off the target skin
return. Radar systems using a doppler shift for gating a target may be
countered by stealing the velocity gate of the locked-on system. Since
gating the target is in frequency, vice time, a slight frequency shift of the
returned signal with respect to the received signal is used to “steal” or
“shift” the tracked signal. This frequency displacement may be applied in
either an upward or downward direction. By constantly changing the
frequency on a programmed basis, a velocity gate pull-off may be
accomplished. Total pull-off periods of 1-10 seconds are typical for use
against most systems at present. It is quite often preferable to use a
down-frequency pull-off in preference to an up-frequency one since some
CW homing missiles use a drop in doppler to arm or detonate the
warhead.

Doppler Noise Jammers

Doppler noise jammers are essentially deception techniques. To be
effective, the jamming aircraft requires indepth knowledge of the target
radar’s operating characteristics. This EA technique has several
purposes. One is to make detection difficult by producing many doppler
signals distributed about the actual target doppler. The victim’s radar
may interpret the extra doppler signals as multiple targets traveling at
slightly different speeds, and display false targets. Blinking doppler noise,
like ordinary blinking noise, interferes with missile angle tracking in
addition to its effect on doppler processing.

If the noise band is narrow enough and distributed correctly (narrow band
repeater noise - NBRN), velocity bin masking results. NBRN requires
some knowledge of the victim’s doppler processing. Velocity bins are
electronic filters that sample the radar return signal according to doppler
frequency. Target detection takes place by recognizing that one of the
filters has a signal stronger than the other filters. To cause velocity bin
masking, the jammer frequency shifts the pulse during amplification.
When the radar distributes the pulse spectrum in the velocity bins, many
other doppler returns surround the target doppler. Depending on the
individual radar design, the target radar automatically adjusts the
detection thresholds above receiver noise to avoid false detections. Ifthe
threshold rises enough, it prevents detection of the true target return.
The result is a “blank scope” (no returns).

Sidelobe Jamming

A sidelobe jammer introduces noise or deception through the victim’s
radar sidelobes (Figure D-11). In normal operation, the target radar
filters out the sidelobe echoes so that they are not displayed. False targets
in azimuth or noise strobes may result if the victim’s radar system is
unable to discriminate between energy received through the main beam
and sidelobes. If the victim radar is able to discriminate, the system
attempts to gain out the interfering sidelobe energy thereby reducing
detection effectiveness.

Standoff Jamming (SOJ)

Standoff jammers support other assets that may or may not be equipped
with self-screening jamming capability on board. SOJ can be employed
using a variety of jamming techniques, including noise, to mask an
attacking element. Since most radars and radar missiles prefer the strong
noise signal over the actual target return, the SOJ can be very difficult to
differentiate, avoid and/or destroy. SOJ platforms can be aircraft, trucks
or fixed sites.

MECHANICAL COUNTERMEASURES (EXPENDABLES)
Chaff

The purpose of chaff is to present the victims radar with additional false
target returns or decoy the victims tracking circuits from the intended
target. Chaff is composed of strips of fiberglass or aluminum cut to a
specific fraction of radar wavelength. This makes it a very effective
reflector of radar energy. The effectiveness of chaff against doppler radars
depends on several factors. For chaff display in search, winds aloft must
be sufficiently strong to give the chaff a velocity greater than the system
filters set to process out ground returns in search. To be effective against
a doppler radar in track, the chaff must bloom quickly enough to present a
good radar target while still within the velocity gate established for the
target. A pulse radar sees the chaff cloud as it blooms behind the
dispensing aircraft, and usually transfers lock to the chaff. Chaff may
cause radar missiles to fuze prematurely by triggering the missile
proximity fuse when the missile flies through/by the chaff cloud.

The chaff cartridge is the most common delivery mechanism. Each
cartridge dispenses chaff dipoles cut to a specific length to match the
victim radar’s frequency. The chaff must be delivered in quantities that
create a radar cross section larger than the dispensing aircraft. When
delivery is required, a beam aspect provides the best radar cross section
and additional cartridges serve to increase the density of the chaff, but do
not enhance self-protection by increasing the cross section. The dispense
rate must be optimized to give the best chance of survival.

EW-1 D-16


Text from EW-1_Generic_Electronic_Attack_page_23.jpeg:
Decoys

A decoy is an expendable aircraft-like vehicle (powered or glider) launched
from or towed by a penetrating aircraft to provide deception and
saturation of a defense network. Decoys usually are made to be
indistinguishable from the launch aircraft by the addition of corner
reflectors, which provide a radar return similar in intensity to the
penetrating aircraft. Decoys can also be equipped with chaff and
physically small noise jammers to mimic penetrating aircraft EA, or with
repeater jamming to produce a radar return equal to the target aircraft.
By duplicating the speed, altitude and course of a penetrating aircraft, a
deceptive target can be introduced into the enemy’s radar defense system.
This can serve to draw fire away from the real aircraft and degrade enemy
defenses.

Flares

Flares are EA devices designed to counter IR frequency receivers that
depend only on IR energy emitted by a target aircraft. Flares produce a
second heat source that attempts to draw an IR tracking head off of the
primary IR source. The desired result is a wide miss or transfer of missile
lock from the primary target to the flare.

The flare must reach a peak intensity shortly after deployment. Flare rise
time is the time required to meet this peak. Peak intensity rises faster at
lower altitudes than at higher flight levels. The flare burn time varies
with application and is faster at low altitudes. Maneuvering may be
required to effectively utilize flare characteristics.

Lamps

Lamps is a form of IRCM using a high power quartz lamp to confuse the
IR missile guidance. The lamp is blinked at a programmed rate to cause
the missile seeker head to oscillate between the lamp and the actual
aircraft heat source, resulting in a missile steering error.

Masking
Masking is an EA technique using certain design features of the aircraft
to deflect radar returns or diffuse the target IR source. The result of

masking is a reduced radar or IR signature causing a loss of efficiency to
missile tracking systems.

TEXT
INTRODUCTION

Jamming is the radiation or reradiation of signals in such a way as to
interfere with the operation of a victim’s radar. Possible jamming
methods include the transmission of noise (continuous RF energy), the
transmission of a series of pulses or a combination of both. Whatever
method is employed, the purpose of jamming is to create confusion and
deny information, thus degrading an enemy’s offensive and defensive
capabilities.

Electronic attack (EA) is the employment of electronic devices and
techniques for the purpose of destroying or degrading the effectiveness of
an enemy's electronic aids to warfare. EA comes in three primary forms:
noise jamming, deception jamming and mechanical countermeasures.

D-1 EW-1


Text from EW-1_Generic_Electronic_Attack_page_8.jpeg:
NOISE JAMMING

Noise jamming consists of a frequency emitter that is “tuned” to the
victim’s radar frequency, similar to tuning an FM radio. Noise jamming
has the effect of filling radar listening time with RF energy that is of
greater intensity than the returning radar pulse (Figure D-1). The victim
radar is therefore unable to detect the returning radar pulse. This denies
the victim radar the capability to time the returning pulse (range
capability). Noise jamming can take many different forms.

B-SCOPE

NOISE JAMMING "STROBE"

EW-1-01

Figure D- 1. Noise Jammer.

Two features of noise jamming are essential for noise jamming to be
effective. First, the jammer must match or be on the frequency of the
emitter to be jammed. Second, the victim radar must perceive the
jamming as continuous. If the jammer is unsuccessful in either of these
requirements, the jamming will be noneffective.

EW-1 D-2


Text from EW-1_Generic_Electronic_Attack_page_9.jpeg:
Power Distribution and Burn-Through

Since jamming signals are one-way transmissions, they often enjoy a
distinct power advantage over radar reflected energy at longer ranges.
However, when a jammer approaches the victim radar, its jamming power
increases by the square of the distance, whereas the echo power increases
by the fourth power. Assuming the jammer’s available power is less than
that of the victim radar, at some range the echo’s power is greater than
the jammer’s. The jammer can no longer mask the radar return, and
burn-through is achieved (Figure D-2).

DESIGNATIONS AND A/G HIERARCHY

A quick review of the basic bombing triangle will help you understand how we get bombs on target. At
some point the jet must put a stake in the ground to know how far away, and how high it is in reference to the
TGT to determine Slant Range (SR). There are six ways that we can designate a target: NAV, RDR, POD,
HUD, CDIP and SIT designations will be covered. Zero point will not be covered. We have 6 different ranging
sources to complete the bombing triangle: LAS, HRM, SYS, AGR, RALT, and PASS. PASS will not be

covered. Let’s go over different designation options with the associated ranging options (depending on what
you set up in the hierarchy).

SLANT RANGE (SR)
HEIGHT ABOVE TGT (HAT)

AN

GROUND RANGE (GR)

(Figure 1)

The above figure matters to you mainly because of HAT. When you take a designation (RDR for example), the
jet determines your Alt by looking at SYSG (assuming good EGI). HAT = SYSG — TGT ELEV (which you
put into the point data submenu). Don’t think that number matters for accuracy? Reference figure 2 below.

> Scenario: You don’t put in the TGT Elevation in the UFC Point Data Submenu. After flying 300+ NM to the
TGT area, you designate the DMPI in the RDR. After transitioning to the TGT Pod, you cannot find your DMPI
anywhere in your FOV so you go thru dry. BOTOT - not quite. Your jet thinks it is much farther away due to its
SR calculation. Since you put in nothing (0’) in the data submenu, the jet performed the equation this way:
SYSG (20K) — 0 = 20K’. That number will push your SR farther away and your pod is probably queuing up
short. Yes, there are other places in the world besides Dare County and the Sandbox MOA in Iraq.

A/C ALT: 20,000’ MSL

SR

TGT Elev: 5000’
HAT — 15,000’

(Figure 2)


Text from Hieracrhy_page_2.jpeg:
Hopefully you understand how the bombing triangle works and answered a few questions on why your pod may
not be looking where you expect it to be. Let’s move onto the meat of the mission. What the hell do I set for my
hierarchy, why do I set that, and what exactly is the best solution for multiple scenarios?

1= One time shot when you take your designation

CDES= __ Continuous designation w/TPOD track and no TDC Pressure (CDES Containerized)

15°= HAT is updated at 15” TREL — Assuming it is in the hierarchy

I'll cover all designation options with various setting on the A/G Delivery page (Hierarchy).

1. NAV DESIGNATION: When you steer to a TGT point, you place a NAV designation with your PPKS. This
places a stake in the ground only as accurate as your coordinates input into the system and your PPKS, which is
normally EGI giving the solution of ground range (GR) to the target. You should look at your Menu 2 page to
continually check on your EGI accuracy and/or give EGI updates to your MN but that discussion will be saved
for later. What you should see on Menu 2 is: Y *4EGI 24’. Y=Military code. *=blended solution. 4=# satellites
tracking. 24’=position uncertainty.

NAV designations with good EGI is an accurate ranging source but as you know, we like to, and normally are
required to, verify and/or update/designate our DMPI with active sensors before being cleared to release. This is
mainly due to ROE restrictions. A NAV designation can be overwritten by any other designation procedure but
it is also one of the most accurate with good EGI and mensurated coordinates.

Bottom Line: If you do nothing else but type in your TGT point into the UFC and steer to the target, you can
only satisfy one of three ranging sources (reference Fig. 3): AGR, RALT, or SYS. Both LAS and HRM require
an active sensor to be used for the designation — 1.e. fire the laser for LAS and RDR designate w/ a pod
designation for HRM.

SYS: Height Above Target (HAT) will come from SYSG (assuming EGI is PPKS). The number comes from
the system altitude that can be found on the A/G delivery page. GR comes from accuracy of coordinates and
PPKS. This is a one time (thus passive) ranging source taken at designation. SR is the last part of the triangle
that is “computed” from the other two known sides.

RALT: Active ranging source when in an AUTO delivery and automatically chimes in at 15” TREL. HAT is
assumed to be equal to HAG while using RALT ranging. Obviously a huge miscalculation in the making if your
TGT if it is at a different altitude than you are (mountainous terrain). So whatever HAG you are at pickle, the
CC assumes that also is your HAT. RALT has a validity check and the data is only used if the aircraft attitude is
less than 60° of bank and pitch. Use only in flat terrain.

AGR: Air-to-ground ranging (AGR) is the method of computing target elevation during designations and HAT
for weapons delivery using A/G radar slant range. It provides a one time HAG computation at designation and
SR derived from antenna depression angle by pointing at the target coordinates using a 1.25° radar beam OR
points at the target through the TGT Pod LOS. Low altitudes will increase your RDR footprint and decrease
your bombing accuracy. GR is the last part of the triangle that is computed from the other two known sides.


Text from Hieracrhy_page_3.jpeg:
e Valid if: Graze angle >1.25°, Within RDR gimbal limits, and Range must be within —10,000 to +15,000
feet of the designated target position
When the pilot takes command of the HUD and the target pod laser is not firing, the CC commands the radar to
provide AGR to a HUD reference (pipper pointing). In AUTO bombing mode, AGR is provided to the
designated target. In CDIP bombing mode, AGR is always to the CDIP pipper (with or without a target

designation). All this assumes that AGR is in the hierarchy & above Sys (LHAS). Also can get by taking
command of the pod 2x as long as AGR is in the hierarchy - anywhere.

2. RADAR DESIGNATION: When you designate off a .67 HRM patch map you refine the stake in the ground
accuracy from your PPKS to ~8.5 feet at best (pretty damn good). Many factors go into getting that number
down to 8.5 feet. A recent INS and MN PVU, speed, squint, graze, G, and range, are a few key factors.
Bottom Line: You can only satisfy one of three ranging sources (reference Figure 3): AGR, RALT, or SYS if
you do nothing but designate a TGT using an HRM patch map and hit the pickle button at TREL. Sound
familiar? Reference the earlier definitions of SYS, RALT and AGR. You WILL NOT get an HRM designation
by ONLY designating the TGT with the A/G RDR. See following paragraph for HRM. Bottom line is this is
one of the BEST ways to get an accurate designation. It also forces good Radar Scope Interpretation (RSI) for
the young WSO’s. Kill it in the RDR! I like to think of it as “verifying and refining”. With your standard LHS
or LHSA, assuming good EGI, this is the most accurate designation source. This is of course debatable which
you'll read about next.

3. TGT POD DESIGNATIONS (TP): Laser ranging (LAS) is the means of using Laser slant range for
computing target range/elevation and/or HAT for target designations and computed weapons deliveries. With a
TP designation, you can have any of the 6 ranging sources applied: LAS, HRM, SYS, AGR, RALT, and PASS.
Same rules apply with SYS, AGR, and RALT. Let’s cover the HRM validity.

HRM: * HRM takes the stake in the ground from your RDR Des (GR) and uses TP Angle (SR) to determine
HAT.
To get an HRM designation, you must:
1. Take a RDR designation of the TGT.
2. Update your designation of the TGT with the TGT POD without firing the laser sometime prior to
hitting the pickle button.(which we never do--intentionally). With the standard LHS, LHAS or
LHSA, when you fire the laser to re-designate with the pod, LAS will become the valid ranging
source. *Note: There are rare cases where LAS will get stuck in “San” meaning sanity checks not
complete. Take a look at your A/G Delivery page. HRM in and of itself is not the best choice with
LAS or SYS stacked above; although not a bad choice at low altitude. At best, you’re looking at
100’ accuracy.

LAS: Do steps 1 and 2 above AND fire the laser? Now you get LAS ranging (LHS hierarchy setup). LAS is
best used if =2.5° graze (I actually like closer to 5°). Note how low altitude delivers will hurt you by updating
and designating in the Pod using laser ranging due to spotlight effect.

Text from Hieracrhy_page_4.jpeg:
Here is where the misconception lies when aircrew think that Pod designations are getting you a “better
designation”. Look at Figure 3 closely and you’ll see that under a TGT Pod Designation using LAS as a ranging

source it says “1 or CDES”. People always say, “Gutter, I thought that the pod using laser ranging is one of the
most accurate sources out there?” Before I get into scenarios, I’1l preface my words with —I do not teach to
sport bombing. Young WSO’s should practice solid procedures on the range so that they’re second nature when
in combat — Period. RSI in this community is much worse than bad........ it sucks. I could care less where a
BDU-33 flies on the range if the procedures are solid.

EXAMPLES AND TTP ’'s

Scenario 1: Dropping LGB’s with good EGI or a MN update & designation: I designate my DMPI perfectly in
the RDR. I do nothing else (with my sensors) until 8” TIMPCT and guide my bomb to the DMPI. Yes the
assumption is the time from designation to drop is well within 5+00 minutes. This is not a paper on TGT pod
search so by “do nothing,” I mean — no update and designation with the pod on final.

Scenario 2: Dropping LGB’s with good EGI: I designate my DMPI perfectly in the RDR. I then wait for valid
LAS ranging (5 digit) in the POD and re-designate. I do nothing else until 8” TIMPCT and guide my bomb to
the DMPI.

** Tn both scenarios, I’m actually dropping BDU’s — doesn’t matter whether they’re 50’s or 33’s or MK-82’s
for that matter. Which bomb score is going to be better? I will argue that Scenario 1 will be better — or at least is
less likely to get jacked up. Remember that “1 or CDES” statement? I will bet on my one time designation in
the RDR over my one time designation using the Targeting Pod. Remember, it’s the “one time” in the pod I
could potentially have a problem with. CDES selected with LAS ranging is a whole different story but we don’t
practice those procedures due to delay Las options on most drops. Many factors affect that one time
designation: water, laser energy, pod pointing errors, did you really have 5 digit ranging or “4.5nm” in the upper
left hand corner of the pod when you designated? I learned under the old school of killing things in the RDR
and you know what, it works. I’ve seen many students since I’ve been an instructor not have a clue what they’re
looking at in the RDR, transition to the Pod and are assholes and elbows hoping, searching and praying that
they find their target in the pod on a check ride. It’s easy to compare the student that confidently kills their
DMPI in the RDR, and sits on his/her hands waiting for TREL knowing that the DMPI will be somewhere very
close to their cursors when they return to cue. No frantic searching and heavy breathing during that 1+30 from
designation to TREL!

One disclaimer here is the difference between Training Laser and Combat Laser. In short, Training Laser
updates (or solves the bombing triangle) at a rate of 1 Hz or 1 time per second. Combat laser works the same
equation at a maximum of 20 times per second. So remember this difference if you’re at the range and your
scores suck but your procedures are solid — with training laser set, you’ ll loose quarters. If I’ve designated with
my sensor capable of achieving ~8.5’ accuracy and have good EGI, I’m not sure I can “increase the accuracy”
of my designation. Remember, we’re dropping LGB’s so why really “increase the accuracy” by a few feet when
my bomb is looking for a basket anyway? Again, less likely to get jacked up if I killed it in the radar already.

The last thing I’ll say about Pod designations is this. There are scenarios where you should take that one time
designation in the Pod. Answer this question to your self — not now, but while going 9 miles a minute: “ Will a
designation in the pod increase the accuracy of my designation?” If the answer is yes — than do it! Weapons
effects that you planned at 0 knots is the goal. Here are a few examples:

A. Good EGI, found my DMPI in the RDR, found it at 15” TREL in the pod — I’m done until 8” TIMPCT.
Assumes medium altitude and LGB’s. I’ve already verified and refined my designation. *This is
debatable and my technique. My mentality is this: how much am I refining my designation — we’re
talking a couple of feet at best. I believe that the LGB’s can handle that cross range vs. what could go
wrong by messing with the pod and laser at 15” TREL.


Text from Hieracrhy_page_5.jpeg:
B. Bad EGI or running MN, couldn’t find the DMPI or offset in the RDR, found it in the pod at 15” TREL
- Get valid Las ranging and designate. Assumes medium altitude or >2.5°graze angle.

C. Low Alt loft with or without EGI — climb to map and designated my DMPI in the RDR. I’m done until
8” TIMPCT to las. Don’t mess with the pod in a loft!

D. Low Alt loft w/EGI- climb to map and couldn’t find my DMPI in the RDR. I’m done until 8” TIMPCT;
don’t mess with the pod in a loft!

E. Low Alt loft no EGI — climb to map, took an update designation within 5+00 minutes of release — I’m
done until 8” TIMPCT. Have I mentioned, don’t mess with the pod in a loft!

F. Low Alt LAT w/ good EGI — climb to map and designated my DMPI in the RDR. I will put in AGR
above SYS or fire the laser down the chute to get active ranging for a countdown in the HUD.

G. Low Alt LAT w/ bad EGI or running MN- climb to map and couldn’t find my DMPI in the RDR. I now
have a NAV Des which I’ Il follow up with a TGT Pod Designation while in the check-to-climb or down
the chute (remember when there is G on the jet (insert range), stop firing the laser. Again, use AGR or
LAS for an active source for SR in the HUD.

H. Low Alt loft no EGI or running MN — no update/designation within the last 5+00 minutes due to threat
reactions, gross RSI or whatever. I’m designating in the pod — especially if the TGT has good vertical
development. Re-attack would be my first option but without getting into a whole tactical scenario, this
must be a high risk mission, we have to get in and out and I only got one chance to kill this target. I'll
take a designation while the front-seater is in a pull to sacrifice some CTBE. I think in this case, I
answered the above question to myself “can I increase the accuracy of the designation” as “YES”.

Disclaimer: Don’t take what I say or this paper and use it as a checklist. After the B-course and after MQT, you
must be able to think while traveling at high rates of speed with multiple tasks being thrown at you. As with
most operations the F-15E, the best route to take depends on the situation. In weapons delivery, the
situation depends on the type of ordnance, delivery, weather, threat, terrain, ROE and aircrew
proficiency. The above eight examples certainly DO NOT cover ALL possible scenarios, they merely hammer
home the point to know what delivery your doing (and your backup) and keep track of what you have set for
your hierarchy so you’re not surprised when AGR kicks in and takes the A/A RDR at 15” TREL (for example).

**Remember, I’m not saying DO NOT re-designate in the pod...... this is my technique for LGB’s. If I did not
kill it in the RDR w/ bad EGI or running MN is my #1 case where I’ll designate in the Pod. Another may be a
update / designation outside of 5+00 with or without good EGI. Others will say always designate in the pod but
most of those people are not fully on board with how accurate my EGI actually is (or I’m trying to teach habit
pattern to the B-course studs).

4. HUD DESIGNATIONS: HUD designations are handled by the CC in the same way as a Pod Des. It derives
it’s SR from Pipper to TGT and it’s HAT from SYS G assuming good EGI. Two techniques are to designate
using the TDC or the pickle button. I highly recommend only using the TDC method with today’s ROE’s and
constraints with regards to dropping weapons in anger. When you reach for the red button with your thumb — I
think you better mean it.

5. CDIP: LAS, AGR, RALT and SYS are the four ranging sources used with CDIP. I’ll cover the most
common scenario. At a minimum we’ll have some kind of designation out there on or close to the target that
we’re getting ready to roll in on. If doing diving deliveries, I normally want AGR or RALT in the equation prior
to SYS. I want an active source for two reasons. 1. I want SR displayed in the HUD. 2. I want an active ranging
source down the chute for the most accurate designation at release.

5. SIT DESIGNATIONS: I won’t get too involved here but simply mention this. You have to know where
your designation is coming from. Is it coming from JSTARS, AWACS, or another Strike Eagle. Bottom line is
as of this paper August 2006 we really use the SIT to cue our systems and then rely on standard designation


Text from Hieracrhy_page_6.jpeg:
procedures. If you’re wondering how accurate you’re pod or RDR will cue, look at the altitude when you hook
the designation, this is the most inaccurate measurement taken from the SIT designation.

Final Suggestions and Common Student Errors:

Next time you’re out flying CT — Flush the quarters BS at the range and go out there to learn something. Here is
a recommended profile (assuming LGB procedures on each drop), have an A/G delivery page up on your
R-MPCD to watch the validity checks done real-time. Reference Figure 5 at the end of the paper for where to
find Designation source and Ranging source on the A/G Event Page.

1. Fly with LHSA. Take a RDR Designation and do nothing else until 8” TIMPCT.

. Same LHSA, this time take a RDR Designation, then update that with the TGT Pod prior to pickle.

3. Same LHSA, this time take a RDR Designation (or don’t), PTRK your DMPI and fire the Laser
continuously until just prior to pickle. Next time fire the Laser all the way through pickle simulating a
drop with continuous laser planned. Take command of the pod 2x and see if AGR kicks in.

4. Next switch to LHAS. Designate in the RDR. See when exactly your AGR kicks in on an Auto attack —
what does the A/A radar look like.

5. Next switch to LHRS. Designate in the RDR and leave it, see what RALT give you.

Do the same designation (.67 RDR with expand) on each pass and see what your scores are. I bet you'll be
surprised. Remember these are BDU’s not LGB’s. Bent fins, slow firing carts, winds etc will all lead to various
scores so don’t take your best score and file that as your #1 hierarchy setup in the future. I’ve done similar
profiles on many trips to the range and I’ve learned a ton. I recommend you do the same.

There are many, many more checks that you can do from diving and climbing deliveries out of the RDR pattern
to pilot events. Bottom line; know what each setting gives you.

I’ve already hinted at common student error #1: No RSI. Dare County sets you up for failure here; there’s no
doubt about that in my mind. Remember when killing TGT’s in the RDR to know what you’re looking for. A
3.3 map is a confirmation tool for me. Do I see the relationships from my TGT to my offsets? Yes, then lets
scroll down to a 1.3 or a 6.7 and dig out my DMPI. Dare County sets your pacing for “real” targeting way off.
You should not be so conditioned to “freeze” the RDR if it’s not giving you what you want. Let it cook off
another map and you may have a much clearer picture the second or maybe even third .67. WSO’s be
DIRECTIVE is the FCP isn’t giving you what you need — Squint, graze, airspeed etc....

Pod search, confirmation and tracking techniques are not good from young studs. Remember, this all starts on
the systems check. I will focus and tune my pod when I start to pass the altitude that I’m doing my primary
attack. I take a look at Auto Level Gain (ALG) but rarely set it. You can get a better picture if you spend a few
seconds on it. When I’m on final, I’m switching from BHT to WHT to see which gives me the best picture and
it also serves as a shadows confirmation tool. I’m also looking for all the confirmers, fakers, and pointers that
1B talked to me about in the brief. I refuse to sit in NFOV and stare at the crosshairs waiting for my DMPI to
appear. Take a look around from 1+30” to +30” TREL. At 30” TREL, it’s time to start digging out your DMPI
and giving the pilot a ““DMPI captured, cleared to release” call. If you can that call earlier, great. Just don’t
expect it and certainly don’t get nervous if it hasn’t happened by 30” TREL. Remember around 13 NM is the
max range for combat laser. That equates to about 1+30 on the clock prior to TREL anyway. Later you’ll learn
about CDE and the bus load of nuns. Remember these are LGB’s so if you see friendlies coming into your
FOV endgame, slowly drag it off your target!


Text from Hieracrhy_page_7.jpeg:
Radar setup starts on the ground. I set B or C Channels on the Radar. I turn my gain down to 6. I can always
bring it up if need real-time. I don’t buy the ML2 in an urban area. Use it if you’re conditioned to freeze the first
map you see because it’s probably as good as it’s going to get. If you use my technique, I’m sure that a good
INS PVU in the cap followed up with a MN PVU prior to mapping (assuming MN PPKS) and letting a few
.67’s cook off will get you just as good a picture as ML2 (My technique). If you’re in the B-course or MQT- set
MLI — period.

I’m done — questions or comments, see me.

Table D-1 is a list of common target area objects and their emissivities.
Notice that the emissivities of some common targets, such as concrete and
oil-base painted surfaces, are nearly the same as common backgrounds
(plants, ground, and snow).

Table D - 1. Emissivity Table.

The amount of IR energy emitted by an object varies at the fourth power
of the temperature and directly with emissivity. Therefore, the
temperature of an object has a much greater effect on the emitted IR
energy than emissivity. For example, consider a camouflaged aircraft
(emissivity of .94 and 20° C) parked on a snow-packed ramp (emissivity of
.91 and 10° C). The temperature spread causes a much larger difference
in IR energy intensity than the difference in emissivity.

LAN-1 D-4


Text from LAN-1_IR_Introduction_page_11.jpeg:
Thermal Inertia

Thermal inertia refers to the length of time it takes an object to heat up or
cool down. Large, dense objects like tanks take longer to heat and cool
than smaller, less dense objects, and so are said to have high thermal
inertia. The open framework of a transmission tower gives it low thermal
inertia—it is sensitive to heat loss or gain due to convective transport.

Target Orientation/Aspect

An object’s IR signature may appear different, based on the angle from
which it is approached by the sensor, because some of its surfaces may be
warmer than others. For example, a building’s orientation to the sun
determines which wall receives the most warming from the sun. (In the
northern hemisphere, when the sun is setting, the southwest side of a
building is warmer than its other sides.) An internally heated object, such
as a vehicle, has a hotter spot in the vicinity of its exhaust. When
approached from their warmest aspects, these objects may appear
brighter and larger in an IR sensor display than they would have if
approached from their cooler sides.

Background Clutter

Background objects that have the same IR intensity as a target object can
create thermal background clutter, hindering recognition of target objects.
Battlefield fires and destroyed vehicles (which may include deliberate
attempts to decoy IR weapons) must be expected in combat situations.


Text from LAN-1_IR_Introduction_page_12.jpeg:
TRANSMISSION OF IR ENERGY

The transmission of IR energy from an object to the sensor is affected by
the range and the existing atmospheric conditions.

Range

An important factor in the transmission of IR energy is the distance
between the sensor and the source. The intensity of IR radiation
transmitted through the atmosphere varies inversely with the square of
the distance it has to travel. Therefore, at twice the distance, the amount
of IR energy received decreases by a factor of four.

Environmental Conditions

Most objects of tactical interest emit in the 8 to 12 micron range at
temperatures of -100° C to +100° C. This IR subregion is called an
“atmospheric window” because atmospheric absorption of IR energy is
slight and minimally affects IR transmission. However there are
conditions that, if severe, can obliterate the IR scene.

Absolute Humidity and Dew Point

As IR energy travels through the atmosphere the distance at which it can
be observed can be reduced by various elements in the atmosphere. The
major components of air (oxygen and nitrogen) do not absorb, scatter, or
emit IR energy. However, other elements (carbon dioxide and water
vapor) absorb IR energy, significantly reducing IR transmission. Absolute
humidity (the total number of water molecules in the air) is the most
restrictive factor in using IR systems and is reported as grams per cubic
centimeter (gm/cm*). The dew point temperature (temperature at which
the air is fully saturated) can be used as an estimated measure of the total
water vapor in the air; i.e., the higher the dew point, the higher the
absolute humidity. Thus, the dew point can be used to determine IR
transmission ranges (the higher the dew point, the higher the absolute
humidity, equals the shorter range). Table D-2 gives examples of dew
points and their respective approximate IR visibilities.

LAN-1 D-6


Text from LAN-1_IR_Introduction_page_13.jpeg:
Dew Point (° F) Approximate IR Ranges (nm)

Table D - 2. Dew Point Versus IR Ranges.

Relative Humidity

Relative humidity is the ratio of the amount of water vapor in the air at a
specific temperature compared to the maximum amount the air can hold
at that temperature. In other words, while absolute humidity is the total
number of water molecules, relative humidity is a ratio relative to the
maximum possible at that temperature.

Precipitation

When visible moisture is in the air (e.g., rain, snow, or dense fog), both
absorption and scattering of IR wavelength energy increases and
transmission is decreased. When the ground is soaked by rain or covered
with snow, there is little thermal contrast between turn points/target and
backgrounds. This results in a washed out NAV FLIR image.

At low viewing angles, snow reflects the sky temperature and appears
dark on an IR display. Under cloudy skies at low altitude, snow reflects
warm clouds which emit absorbed solar radiation. Snow appears light
under this condition.


Text from LAN-1_IR_Introduction_page_14.jpeg:
Clouds

Dense fog and clouds impact the IR scene in several ways. They are
opaque to IR energy, and virtually eliminate its transmission from an
object to a sensor. Clouds block the sun, and reduce solar loading on
targets and backgrounds. This reduces )T between nonoperating targets
and their backgrounds.

Low clouds have a greater effect on the thermal contrast than middle or
high clouds during the day. Cloud coverage in excess of eight-tenths of the
sky has a dramatic impact on the blackbody temperature of targets and
backgrounds. Cloud coverages of less than six-tenths have relatively little
effect. Rapidly changing scattered-to-broken-cloud cover causes a high
degree of variability in the target thermal scene. However, trees seem
insensitive to any amount of low clouds.

Middle clouds have a similar, although less pronounced effect on
blackbody temperatures. Thin, high clouds have virtually no effect on the
blackbody temperature of targets and backgrounds. Thick, high clouds
have a slightly greater effect, but do not approach that of low and middle
clouds.

For operating (internally heated) targets, cloud coverage may increase )T
by keeping the background cooler than it would be on a clear day.

Cloud cover at night tends to reduce the radiative cooling, which reduces
overall thermal contrast.

Haze And Smoke

Normally, light traveling through haze is scattered by the dust particles,
resulting in restricted visibility. However, since infrared waves are longer
than visible light waves they travel through haze without scattering. This
makes it possible to see through dry haze and smoke with an IR sensor.
(Smoke may be a problem if it is thick enough, and IR opaque smokes are
being developed for camouflage purposes.)

LAN-1 D-8


Text from LAN-1_IR_Introduction_page_15.jpeg:
Wind

Thermal contrast can be reduced by surface winds. The amount of
reduction in delta T is dependent on wind speed and the terrain. The
stronger the wind and flatter the terrain, the more it affects thermal
contrast. Further, objects with less mass are more sensitive to the effects
of wind than more massive objects. For example, it takes less wind to cool
a thin radio tower on flat terrain to the same IR level as the background
than it does a large building in mountainous terrain.

Diurnal Cycle

For all objects exposed to the sun, solar heating begins at sunrise, and
cooling begins after midday. After sunset, objects cool to near the air
temperature. During this diurnal cycle, objects heat and cool at different
rates, based on their density and surface composition.

The times when the temperature difference between target objects and
their backgrounds becomes zero is called thermal crossover. Crossover
occurs most frequently during morning and evening (Figure D-3), but can
occur at various times, depending on materials and weather conditions.
During crossover, a target object may be indistinguishable from its
background to IR sensors.

TACTICAL DECISION AID

Introduction

The tactical decision aid (TDA) is a computer program used by weather

forecasters to assist you in predicting how the IR scene will appear, and to

determine maximum acquisition and lock on ranges. The product of this

program can be modified to suit local commanders. You will see a sample

of it in the next IR lesson.

The program uses three different models for its computation:

e The target contract model estimates thermal contrast ()T) between
the target and background. (Delta T is determined by comparing the

equivalent blackbody temperature of any two items.)

e The atmospheric transmission model predicts how well target
contrast will be transmitted through the atmosphere.

e The sensor performance model describes how well a sensor works
over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, compares
that to the target’s signal, and yields acquisition ranges and turn
points.

Input Data

The pilot or WSO is responsible for providing information to the weather

forecaster for use in the TDA. During combat, Intelligence may also

provide certain information such as use of obscurants or site activity. The
information needed by the weather shop is of three different types.

Mission Information

e Date and time of the mission

e The times over navigation points and targets

e Type of IR sensors used

Target and Background Information

Target location data - latitude, longitude, elevation, and orientation
Target operations state - whether engines are running or not running

General target data - Is it heated, or does it generate heat? Are there
areas that stand out as hot spots (smoke stacks, cooling towers)?
Conspicuous cold spots (air conditioning ducts, metal roofs, settling
ponds)? Is the target camouflaged in any way?

Background information includes type of vegetation, soil type and
characteristics, roads or other landmarks that can obscure the target,
bodies of water in the vicinity of the target, and background smoke
direction

Include a photo of target and area, if possible


Text from LAN-1_IR_Introduction_page_18.jpeg:
Output Data

TDA output data is modifiable, but usually includes

e =a hot-to-cold list with )Ts,

@ an indication of the level of atmospheric transmissivity, and
e IR detection, laser, and lock on ranges.

At most bases supporting IR users, a generic TDA is put out by the
weather shop. It covers the local low levels and ranges, and requires no
input by the aircrew. Ifa special low level or target is required, the
aircrew involved must provide the weather shop with the information
previously discussed if they want a TDA forecast for their mission.

TDA Limitations

e Limited number of target and background models - a target from the
TDA menu having similar characteristics to your target may need to
be substituted.

e = Less than five knots of wind is not considered.

e Forecasting the difference between 7/10 and 10/10 cloud coverage is
difficult, yet it is in this region that the amount of clouds have the
greatest impact on thermal contrasts. A small cloud forecast error
equals a large forecast )T error.

e Strict security is needed on target and tactics information.

INFRARED (IR) PRINCIPLES
Introduction

Radiated and reflected infrared energy is used by F-15E systems for
navigation, targeting, and terminally-guided weapons systems.
Knowledge of infrared energy principles allows you to understand the
dynamics of IR sensor employment.

IR equipment works by detecting and displaying thermal contrast, called
delta T ()T), in the field of view. How well a target stands out against its
background is dependent on many factors, as depicted in Figure D-1.

The Nature of IR Energy

To understand how radiated energy is used in F-15E navigation and
weapons systems, let us begin by reviewing the spectrum of known
electromagnetic radiation ranges (Figure D-2). The longest wavelengths
are the low frequency radio waves starting at the left of the chart, and the
shortest are high frequency gamma rays, shown at the far right.

The expanded detail section of the chart, which includes the IR region,
shows the various subregions of this spectrum used by the NAV and
weapon guidance systems you will study. The wavelengths in the IR
region range from .72 to 1000 microns.

Figure D - 2. Electromagnetic Spectrum.

IR waves, which travel in straight lines outward from the source, are
invisible to the human eye. However, IR detection may be thought of as
“visual” detection using a specialized type of “eye,” which sees at a
different frequency than the human eye. To do this, IR energy is
gathered, focused, and changed into electrical signals through specialized
lenses, prisms, and mirrors. IR vision has problems similar to human
vision, in that objects may be obscured by weather conditions, other
objects, or lack of contrast (such as a green object on a green background).

LAN-1 D-2


Text from LAN-1_IR_Introduction_page_9.jpeg:
TARGET/BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS
IR Intensity

All objects above absolute zero (0° Kelvin, or -459° F, or -273° C) radiate
IR energy. The intensity of radiated IR energy is basically determined by
an object’s absolute temperature and emissivity.

Temperature

An object’s temperature can be increased by internal heating, such as an
engine in an armored vehicle, or a furnace in a building, or it can be
increased externally by the sun on clear days, or by diffused solar
radiation on overcast days. Objects may also be warmed by conduction of
heat from adjacent warmer surfaces, or cooled by convection; e.g.,
exposure to wind.

Emissivity

Emissivity is defined as the ratio of radiation intensity from a specific
surface to the radiation intensity of the same wavelength from a
blackbody at the same temperature. (A blackbody is a theoretically
perfect absorber of all incident IR radiation.) All other factors (including
object temperature) being equal, an object with high emissivity appears
brighter on an IR display than an object with low emissivity.

Objects reflect and absorb external heat in varying degrees. These
variations are caused, for the most part, by differences in surface
composition. Rough surfaces absorb more heat than smooth surfaces. At
the same absolute temperature, objects that are rougher and less
reflective are capable of emitting more IR energy than objects that are
smooth and highly reflective.

NAV FLIR CONTROLS AND FUNCTIONS

The LANTIRN system is made up of two pods: the AN/AAQ-13 navigation
pod and the AN/AAQ-14 targeting pod. The navigation pod, located below
the right intake, contains the NAV FLIR (upper section) and the terrain
following (TF) radar (lower section, Figure D-3). The targeting pod,
located below the left intake, contains the targeting IR and laser
designator. The remainder of this lesson is about the upper section of the
AN/AAQ-13 navigation pod (NAV FLIR).

AN/AAQ-13 Navigation Pod

The NAV FLIR, also known as the FINS (forward imaging navigation set),
is housed in the pylon section of the pod, above the TFR (Figure D-4). The
forward section assembly is made up of the optical and electronic
equipment needed to detect the terrain along the flight path as an
infrared image. It subsequently transforms the image into a video signal
for the HUD. The upper section also contains the pod power supply and a
center section containing a maintenance panel and environmental control
unit (ECU) controller. The lower section contains the TFR system and the
ECU, which supplies all cooling for the NAV pod.

Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_16.jpeg:
Purpose of NAV FLIR

In support of TF operations, the NAV FLIR provides the aircrew with a
limited type of night vision. A FLIR video of real world terrain in front of
the aircraft enhances situational awareness and low altitude maneuvering
capabilities. The system is passive and enemy defenses cannot detect its
use.

The NAV FLIR generates a 21° by 28° (HUD size) black and white image
of terrain ahead of the aircraft. The HUD size contains 480 lines of video;
however, the NAV FLIR produces only 360 lines of video. Therefore, one
line of video is artificially produced for each line of NAV FLIR video in
order to fill the HUD display. It is presented to the pilot in the HUD asa
1:1 correspondence with the real world. This means the IR images should
be exactly superimposed over the real scene. Objects appear in the same
relative size and position as they do in the HUD with the NAV FLIR off,
allowing terrain avoidance, target acquisition and visual weapons
delivery. When the NAV FLIR scene (IR image) is not exactly
superimposed over the real scene, an electrical boresight correction
(discussed later) will be used to correct the condition. Even though the
scene is 1:1, there is no true depth perception. The image presented to the
crew is a TV-like picture requiring the use of TFR to fly low level.

Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_17.jpeg:
NAV FLIR Functional Description

The Risley snap look assembly contains two prisms controlled by
servomotors, which enable the crew to check terrain features. An afocal
lens then receives the IR image and relays it to the scanner assembly.
The IR image is then read by the scanner assembly and routed and turned
by the IR imager to the focus wedge. The received IR image is then
focused on the detector/cooler assembly, which is kept at -186°C to
increase the detector’s sensitivity. It is comprised of a vertical array of
180 photoconductive diodes that produce a small electrical signal when
struck by IR energy. This analog data is passed through the digital scan
converter, which amplifies and converts the information into a digital
representation of the IR scene, which is then converted to composite IR
video for display on the HUD (Figure D-5).

NAV FLIR Operations

Applying Power

The pod is controlled via the sensor control panel (Figure D-6). Placing
the NAV FLIR to STBY powers up the FLIR and initiates the required
5 to 8 minute cool-down period, but may take less than 5 minutes or as
long as 14 minutes, depending on the conditions.

If either the NAV FLIR or the TF RDR switch is out of OFF, power is
supplied to the NAV pod. To shut the pod down, both switches must be
OFF. Power should be removed from the pod prior to shutting down an
engine, cycling a generator or doing anything else that could cause a
power interruption or pressure surge, as this will trip circuit breakers
and/or blow seals in the pod itself, requiring maintenance action. Also,
whenever power is removed from the pod, allow 1 minute in OFF prior to
turning the system back on to avoid tripping the breakers.

HUD Controls

HUD Brightness: The HUD is turned on, and symbology brightness is
controlled by the BRT knob (Figure D-9). Turning the knob clockwise
increases the symbology intensity. The video imagery is not affected.

Day, Auto, Night Switch: Depending on ambient light conditions, select
DAY, AUTO or NIGHT on the HUD Control Panel. DAY applies
maximum intensity control range to all brightness controls. AUTO
enables the HUD to maintain consistent symbol brightness for adequate
illumination at night. NIGHT reduces video and symbology brightness
approximately 98% lower than the “DAY” intensity.

Video Brightness (VID BRT): This knob permits one-step adjustment of
the HUD at night. The knob adjusts the intensity of both the video
imagery and the symbology.

Video Contrast (VID CONT): This knob must be turned on to view the IR
video imagery and to adjust the shades of gray on the HUD.

White Hot and Black Hot

W-HOT or B-HOT are alternately selected by cycling PB #4 on the NAV
FLIR submenu (Figure D-11, left). White hot is the video display in which
hot areas appear as light green and cold areas appear as black. Black hot
is a reversed polarity display, showing hot areas as black, cold areas as
green. The choice of using black hot or white hot is the pilot’s personal
preference.

Mechanical Boresight

During NAV FLIR preflight checks, the mechanical boresight values
should be verified. This is accomplished by selecting boresight (BRST), PB
#9, on the NAV FLIR submenu (Figure D-11, left). This can be done
during the cool-down period. The boresight submenu (Figure D-11, right)
displays the yaw, pitch and roll mechanical boresight values (in
milliradians, mils). These values are unique to each aircraft because of
manufacturing tolerance errors of the pod/aircraft hard point mounting
pads, and are stored in the CC. If the displayed values do not match the
781 values, correct values can be input using the UFC scratchpad and PBs
#2, #3 and #4.

Electrical Boresight

If the NAV FLIR image (azimuth and elevation) is not coincident with the
real world through the HUD, the pilot can electrically slew the FLIR
sensor to the correct boresight using the TDC. Use an object that is in the
approximate center of the HUD display, and visible to the naked eye and
to the NAV FLIR. The object should be a minimum of 2 miles from the
aircraft to increase the accuracy of the boresight and reduce any paralax
errors. First, select the BRST mode (PB #9) on the NAV FLIR submenu,
and then select ELEC (PB #7). N-F BRST appears in the HUD to indicate
the mode. Second, select NAV Master Mode. Third, take command of the
HUD and slew the NAV FLIR seeker in AZ and EL with the TDC (Figure
D-12) to superimpose the IR image on the real world as closely as possible.
To avoid canceling inputs, select DATA or MENU on the UFC to exit the
boresight mode. In flight, if the line of sight gets out of tolerance more
than 13 mils, the caution N-F LOS appears in the HUD when the NAV
FLIR image is showing. When this occurs, the NAV FLIR cannot be relied
on for precise navigation.

NAV FLIR CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS
Physical Limitations

The NAV FLIR has certain physical and operational limitations. These
include:

NAV FLIR field of regard 78° (H) X 39° (W)
HUD field of view 21° (H) X 28° (W)
Center of NAV FLIR XT = 0° Az and -4.5° El from a line

parallel to the aircraft water line.
IR wavelength 8-12 microns
Minimum detectable Delta T Better than 0.15° C
Blind Spot

Because the NAV pod is mounted under the right side of the fuselage, left
LIT and snap look have a blind area in some aircraft attitudes. This blind
spot is caused by the fuselage (and ordnance if loaded) entering the FLIR
field of view as the aircraft is rolled left.

Synchronization

If the NAV FLIR video does not coincide with the real world, there is no
aircrew notification of this error until it exceeds 13 mils, resulting in the
NF LOS caution. Periodically crosscheck NAV FLIR imagery against
terrain seen visually or indicated by the TF/air-to-ground radar. If in
doubt of the synchronization, climb to a safe altitude before investigating.
If necessary, electrically boresight the system using a distant point that is
visible both to the eye and the NAV FLIR.

LAN-2 D - 26


Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_33.jpeg:
Bland Video
There are several possible reasons for bland video.
e Rain, snow or clouds scattering or washing out the IR energy.

e The detector cooler assembly malfunctioning, heating the detector
and thus degrading the video.

e The nose of the aircraft pointed above the horizon into a cloudless
sky.

e A poorly adjusted HUD/NAV FLIR video.

The horizon virtually disappears in wings level flight with a distant, flat
horizon. Banking 2-5° and rolling out can restore the horizon
momentarily.

Target/NAV Points

NAV FLIR night employment experience shows that certain turn
points/targets are better than others for navigational purposes.
Generally, points suitable for day visual navigation are also suitable for
night using the NAV FLIR. Good NAV FLIR navigation features include
portions of small and distinct lakes, land-water contrast, mountain peaks
and industrial complexes. Features that do not make good IR navigation
points include indistinct or similar peaks, bridges, road/railroad
intersections, river bends in forested areas and lines of communication

(LOC).
Lakes

Small lakes (less than 1 nm across) have a high Delta T on calm nights,
but are not observable until close (1 to 2 nm range at 200 feet AGL). They
make good turn points if LOS is not obstructed. Medium lakes (1 to 3 nm
across) show good thermal contrast, and are seen from 1 to 3 nm range at
200 feet AGL. The best turn points are small distinct parts of a lake or
tips of land. Large lakes can be seen at even greater distances.


Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_34.jpeg:
Land Water Contrast

Prominent points of land make excellent navigation points. These include
peninsulas on large bodies of water, islands in large lakes and points on
coastlines. Acquisition ranges from 1 to 4 nm at 200 feet AGL.

Peaks
Isolated peaks show a high thermal contrast against the cold sky
background. On the average, isolated peaks without towers are visually

identified at 5 nm, some as far as 12 nm at 200 feet AGL.

Industrial Complexes

Industrial complexes make excellent navigation points and targets. The
burners, smokestacks, generators and other objects with high thermal
activity are particularly easy to identify. These targets are identified at
8 nm ranges. The average is 5 nm at 200 feet AGL.

Lines Of Communication (LOC)

LOCs such as bridges, road intersections, road/railroad intersections and
railroad junctions do not make good IR navigation points. LOCs are
significantly affected by atmospheric conditions. Attack axis is critical in
identifying LOCs. Flying parallel to the LOC provides the best
opportunity to identify the LOC, though this is not a good tactical choice.
Optimizing line-of-sight and attack axis leads to average acquisition
ranges, at 200 feet AGL, of only 1 nm.

IR Rules of Thumb

Maximum FLIR acquisition ranges occur in dry, clear air. Dirty, moist air
means degraded or minimum pickup ranges. High absolute humidity (i.e.,
high dew point) absorbs IR radiation, reducing the effectiveness of the
FLIR.

Falling precipitation (rain, drizzle, snow or dense fog) reduces the Delta T
significantly. Falling rain appears as large, hot, out-of-focus spots or
vertical lines in the video. Over water flying can also degrade the IR
imagery (i.e., a moisture band can extend up to 500 feet).

LAN-2 D - 28


Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_35.jpeg:
Falling snow appears as a gradual blanding of the video, until no image
remains. Snow on the ground tends to reduce background clutter, and
highlights structures and trees.

Wet ground reduces thermal clutter, but also reduces thermal contrast,
resulting in bland video. Lakes make excellent turnpoints except in
swampy areas where the water and land are almost the same
temperature. Dry ground increases thermal clutter, but normally
provides better contrast between objects and background.

Clear skies increase the Delta T, increase the potential of thermal clutter
and provide sharper diurnal crossovers. Diurnal crossovers occur near
sunrise and sunset and occur more slowly under overcast skies. Overcast
skies reduce the Delta T, but make it easier to see self-heated targets.
Strong winds reduce Delta T.

Massive vertical objects are easy to see, because they are heated
differently than the background. Small or thin objects, such as power
lines or guide wires, are difficult to see.

Attacking with the sun at your back is still better than attacking into the
sun. Shortly after sunset, attacking from the southwest (in the northern
hemisphere) normally gives the best NAV FLIR video.

INTRODUCTION

This lesson on the forward-looking infrared (FLIR) introduces the
navigation pod (AN/AAQ-13). It also addresses the tactical decision aid
(TDA) and pod operation and employment. Your ability to successfully
accomplish your mission will be enhanced by understanding how the NAV
FLIR and terrain following radar (TFR) can help get you to the target on
time. Together, these systems allow more consistent around-the-clock
navigational performance.

A reminder-—when using the NAV FLIR you are looking at a two
dimensional picture of the world, not the world itself. It is a replication, a
duplicate, a man-made image of the world, as though looking at a black
and white TV screen, but not the actual world. So, you must use caution
and correct procedures should you determine that the display does not
exactly mirror the real world. Be ready to quickly and correctly react to
an indication of system failure.


Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_8.jpeg:
TACTICAL DECISION AID

Astute assessment of atmospherics is required for accurate predictions of
acquisition ranges and IR imagery. To support the different IR sensors in
the field, the Air Weather Service designed the tactical decision aid (TDA).
The TDA is a computer program that forecasts the expected thermal
contrast (Delta T), atmospheric transmission, and acquisition range of
targets and turn points. The product can be modified to suit local
commanders. Detection ranges are shown for the NAV and targeting
pods. The WFOV column is for the NAV FLIR and the TGT IR in wide
field of view. The NFOV column is for the TGT IR in narrow field of view.
A worksheet is prepared from forecasts, listing the above mentioned items
and additional comments that may be applicable to IR systems
employment, Figure D-1. The worksheet information is then used to
complete an electro-optics planning flimsy, Table D-1, page D-4.

Text from LAN-2_NAV_FLIR_page_9.jpeg:
A more qualitative description of IR conditions may be used in conjunction
with or to replace the current weather flimsy. For example:

Thermal Contrast Category (AT):
LOW = less than 2°C.

MEDIUM = 2°C to less than 5°C.
HIGH = 5°C and higher.

Polarity:
+ means target warmer than background.

- means target colder than background.

Atmospheric Transmissivity:

POOR .25 or less
FAIR .26 - .45
GOOD 46 - .64

VERY GOOD _ .65 or more

Each base's weather station can produce TDA formats that satisfy specific
requirements of the commanders and weapon systems they support
pursuant to Air Weather Service directives. An example of such a product
is shown in Table D-1, next page.

Level and Gain Knobs

These knobs are used to manually adjust the picture after the
MPD/MPCD display quality has been set. With automatic level and gain,
the target pod automatically adjusts its video gain/level to predetermined
settings. When using manual level and gain, for the best presentation,
tune the display first. With the gray scale selected, adjust the display
brightness so the darkest shade of gray appears black. Then adjust the
contrast so that all shades of gray are distinctly visible. After the display
is adjusted, set the level so that average scene brightness equals the
center shade on the gray scale. Next, increase gain until man-made
objects “bloom” or lose their sharpness, and then back off slightly.

Laser SAFE/ARM Switch

This two-position switch allows the laser to be fired from either cockpit
when it is in ARM and prevents laser fire when in SAFE. The laser status
is shown on the TGT IR display, on the HUD as a diamond around the
gun cross, and by the laser armed light in the FCP next to the right MPD.
The TGT IR power switch must be in the ON position to arm/fire the laser.

Display and HOTAS

As usual, most control functions can be done on the display itself.
Functions are also available on the HOTAS controls, some exclusively, as
shown in Figure D-4. You must be in command of the display to perform
most functions.

INITIALIZATION

The TGT IR presentation can be displayed on any MPD/MPCD. The only
difference is that the MPCD display is black and white instead of black
and green.

Power Off

With no power to the TGT IR the display looks like Figure D-5. Legends
will appear around the display; however, the pushbuttons will be
inoperative. TGT IR OFF-STOWED is displayed when the targeting pod
switch is set to OFF with the targeting pod stowed. TGT IR OFF-
UNSTOWED is displayed when the targeting pod switch is set to OFF
with the targeting pod unstowed. TGT IR OFF-“_” is displayed
whenever the CC is reset with aircraft weight on wheels and pod status is
unknown.

Targeting Pod Power-up

The operating status of the targeting pod is shown in the center of the
display. Placing the targeting pod power switch in STBY changes the
TGT IR OFF (STOWED, UNSTOWED, no text) status to TGT IR NRDY
(STOWED, UNSTOWED, no text) and starts the sensor head cooldown
period. This normally takes 5 to 8 minutes, but may take less than 5
minutes or as long as 15 minutes, depending on the conditions. TGT IR
NRDY is displayed for 5 to 8 minutes (average) while the targeting pod
cryogenic cooler achieves pod detector cooldown.

During cooldown, the targeting pod sensor head is stowed. In the stowed
position, the seeker is rotated 150° counterclockwise. When the cooldown
is complete, TGT IR STBY-STOWED or UNSTOWED is displayed

(Figure D-6). During targeting pod power up, the laser code, mechanical
boresight errors, operating mode, and other control functions are
displayed and selectable even though the video is not displayed. TGT IR
STBY-“ ” is displayed during first time power up when the targeting pod
switch is set to STBY from OFF, the aircraft is weight on wheels, and the
pod status is unknown.

(Figure D-7A). TGT IR OPER-UNSTOWED is displayed when the pod
switch is placed to ON and the pod is unstowed or when the pod becomes
unstowed (Figure D-7B). TGT IR OPERATE-UNSTOWED will be
displayed for 5 seconds after TGT IR VIDEO is displayed.

TARGETING POD SETUP

Once selected, the TGT IR display has two display options: primary (T1)
and setup (T2) in both the A/A and A/G modes. The desired display is
selected by pressing PB #13 (T1/T2). The T1 display (Figure D-8, left)
contains weapon employment data and should be the primary display for
normal targeting pod operations; otherwise, the displays are identical
except that the manual focus control, electrical boresight, and gray scale
options are not available on the T1 display. Initial targeting pod setup
(i.e., focus, boresighting, and tuning) functions are available on, and
performed from, the T2 display (Figure D-8, right).

Targeting Pod BIT

The targeting pod has two types of BITs: PBIT and IBIT. PBIT is
enabled when power is applied to the targeting pod and operates
continuously; it is noninterruptive and automatic. IBIT provides a
comprehensive system test and is performed (with the targeting pod
moded to STBY) via one of two methods:

e Selecting LANT/RALT from the main BIT page (thereby performing
IBIT on both LANTIRN subsystems and the radar altimeter).

e Selecting TGT POD to perform IBIT following selection of
LANT/RALT from the MAINT BIT page.

The first method is preferred since all LANTIRN subsystems can perform
IBIT with one selection. The initiated BIT for the pod takes about 70
seconds. The seeker uncages and looks straight ahead. Then all three
axes are checked; first yaw, then pitch, and last roll. Focus is also
checked. If the laser is placed to ARM prior to the test, the TGT IR will
automatically switch to the training (eye safe) laser and fire while the pod
is stowed during the test profile. This will ensure that the laser will fire
when unstowed. For the last ten seconds, a test pattern of alternating
vertical black and white lines appears. At test termination, the pod
returns to the STBY mode. TGT FLIR* will be displayed on the top level
BIT page, as shown in Figure D-9A, following completion of IBIT if a BIT
failure was detected. The asterisk next to TGT FLIR indicates that
DETAIL information may be available for this subsystem. The targeting
pod can report a maximum of 27 functional failures, 24 of which can be
displayed at one time on the DETAIL BIT page.

CAUTION

The IBIT should be run only when the
aircraft is stationary. While in motion,
an IBIT may cause servo system failure.

A second method of BIT is the individual target pod BIT. This method
BITs only the target pod which may be used to re-BIT the pod if a fault
has been detected in the target pod only or if a LANT/RALT BIT was
accomplished and the target pod was not timed in when the LANT/RALT
BIT was selected (Figure D-9).

TGT IR Tuning and Focus

Auto Level and Gain (ALG)/Manual Level and Gain (MLG) Selection

ALG or MLG may be selected on the T1 or T2 display by toggling PB #4
(Figure D-10). In ALG, ALG is boxed and the targeting pod automatically
adjusts its video gain/level to predetermined settings in the targeting pod.
In MLG, ALG is not boxed and the WSO can manually adjust the gain and
level of the targeting pod video using the gain and level controls on the
sensor control panel.

TGT IR Tuning

The targeting pod video contains a gray scale (Figure D-10) which replaces
the scene video at the bottom of the display upon command from PB #16
on the T2 display. The fixed gray scale occupies the bottom 60 active lines
with nine equally spaced shades of gray ranging from black to white. A
variable gray scale occupies 40 lines above the fixed scale and varies in
intensity based on input from the CONT/BRT controls on the MPD/MPCD

being used.

LAN-3 D-12


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_19.jpeg:
Tuning the display with the target pod video on it before adjusting the
targeting pod gain/level provides the best presentation. The bottom fixed
scale is used to adjust the BRT control on the display so that the darkest
gray level appears black on the display. Then the CONT control on the
face of the display is adjusted until all of the shades of gray are distinctly
visible.

With MLG selected, the top variable gray scale varies as a function of the
IR scene and can be adjusted for optimum brightness and contrast using
the gain and level controls on the RCP sensor control panel. The TGT IR
video is tuned by adjusting the level until the middle gray is the desired
video shade and then adjusting the gain to achieve a slight saturation of
man-made objects. The gray scale should be used for reference only; it
does not indicate if the gain and level setting is correct for the scene.

Manual Focus Control

The manual focus buttons provide the capability to adjust the IR video
sharpness and clarity. The targeting pod automatically adjusts focus
based on lens temperatures; however, in the event that the focus appears
bad in one or more of the video FOVs, you can choose to adjust the focus
by pressing either PB #14 or PB #15 on the T2 display (Figure D-8, right)
until the image focus quality is satisfactory. The corresponding settings
displayed next to the pushbuttons can range in value from -50 to +50,
representing a total of approximately 0.4 inch of travel for the focus
adjustment lens. Separate focus adjustments are stored for wide FOV
(WFOV) and narrow FOV (NFOV); in expanded narrow FOV (ENFOV,
digital expansion of the NFOV video), the NFOV adjustment is used.
Focus settings can also be adjusted by typing in the appropriate focus
values in the UFC scratchpad and pressing either PB #14 or PB #15. The
targeting pod continues to compensate focus for temperature around the
new focus settings and the CC retains these settings until the aircraft is
shut down. A focus setting of zero represents the targeting pod automatic
focus position. At power-up, focus settings are initialized to zero.

Targeting Pod Boresighting

Targeting Pod Mechanical Boresight

Mechanical boresight errors (in mils) are displayed on the T2 display
(Figure D-11) to verify the proper pitch/roll/yaw constants. The
mechanical errors should remain constant until a new boresight is
accomplished or the CC is replaced or reprogrammed. These values
should agree with the values logged in the aircraft’s AFTO Form 781. The
values on the BRST display should be corrected (if required) to agree with
the AFTO Form 781 values. If the values in the AFTO Form 781 are in
hundredths of mils, they should be rounded up to the nearest tenth for
entry via the UFC. The correct mechanical error is entered on the UFC
scratchpad and the appropriate pushbutton (YAW: PB #1, PITCH:

PB #2, or ROLL: PB #3) is pressed while in command of the TGT IR T2
display.

If cueing the targeting pod (with bypass mode selected) yields errors
consistently in the same direction, and if bombing scores are in error in
the opposite direction (i.e., cue left, bombs fall to the right) when using the
targeting pod as the designation sensor, then mechanical boresight errors
should be suspect. Mechanical boresight errors may occur as a result of
incorrect entry of the error values, an alteration of boresight due to
OVER-G, or due to normal wear on the aircraft structure.

Figure D - 11. TGT IR Boressight (T2 Display).

Targeting Pod Electrical Boresight

The targeting pod is mechanically boresighted to assure proper alignment
with the pylon hard points. However, in order to effectively use the
targeting pod, it may be necessary for the aircrew to correct a bad
mechanical boresight or to use a targeting pod that is out of specification.
The aircrew is provided an option to manually correct the boresight
(electrical boresight). The INS must be in NAV to get an accurate
boresight.

Whenever the aircrew uses this electronic boresight correction to correct a
gross boresight misalignment, the targeting pod should be considered as
operating in a degraded mode. The targeting pod has an accuracy of
approximately 1.4 mils with a correct mechanical boresight, whereas the
electrical boresight of the targeting pod through the HUD is no better
than 2.5 mils.


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_22.jpeg:
When in point track (PTRK), BRST is an option that becomes available
above PB #8 on the A/G TGT IR T2 display (Figure D-12). To minimize
parallax errors, PTRK must be initiated on a target that is in the HUD
FOV and at least 1 nm away from the aircraft. Ideally, this operation
should be performed in flight. After selecting BRST, the aircrew is
provided two additional options above PB #7 and PB #9 to either APPLY
or BYPASS the boresight correction, depending on how the pilot views the
boresight alignment through the HUD.

With BRST selected, the targeting pod LOS symbol is replaced by two
concentric circles (6.1 mils and 25.6 mils in diameter) centered over the
position the system calculates as the location of the object being point
tracked. Because of optical path errors, the real world object being
tracked will not be precisely centered inside the circles. To check the
mechanical boresight accuracy, first select BYPASS to clear out any
previous electrical corrections. The concentric circle location is affected by
the mechanical boresight errors entered on the T2 display. Only if the
point track object falls outside the inner circle should the aircrew consider
the option to apply electrical boresight corrections. Boresight errors are
corrected by selecting APPLY to enable electrical boresight corrections,
then, using the TDC while in command of the TGT IR display, slewing the
concentric circles in the HUD (the HUD repeater should never be used for
boresight operations) until they are centered over the point tracked target.
A boresight bias is calculated based on the TDC inputs used to center the
concentric circles. This boresight bias is used by the targeting pod
whenever APPLY is selected. (APPLD is displayed in the second row
above PB #8 on both the T1 and T2 displays.) The targeting pod then
applies these corrections until BYPASS is selected. BRST mode is exited
by deselecting BRST by pressing PB #8 or by commanding untrack.

The aircrew can manually select the desired FOV via the auto acq/mode
reject switch. The EXP option at PB #14 on the T1 display enables the
selection of ENFOV via HOTAS. When in command of the TGT IR display
and with EXP not boxed, pressing the auto acq/mode reject switch forward
for less than 1 second cycles between WFOV and NFOV. If EXP is boxed,
pressing the auto acq/mode reject switch forward cycles from WFOV to
NFOV (Figure D-14, left) to ENFOV (Figure D-14, right) to WFOV. If
EXP is unboxed while in the ENFOV, the targeting pod returns to NFOV.

Within the targeting pod video are four corner markers that outline what
will be seen if the next smaller FOV is commanded. Within the WFOV
display are four corner markers which outline the NFOV. With the NFOV
display are four corner markers which outline the ENFOV when EXP is
selected; if EXP is not selected, then the four corner markers are not
displayed. Within ENFOV no markers are shown. If the target is within
the corner markers, it is within the next smaller FOV.

LOS Position

Within the TGT IR display is a small open box (four small FOV corner
markers) which provides a rapid means to identify the approximate
azimuth and elevation of the targeting pod FLIR/laser LOS with respect
to the aircraft (Figure D-15). It is essentially a plan view of the sensor
position relative to the aircraft. The aircraft position is always in the
center of the display with the top of the display representing forward of
the aircraft.

Magnetic Heading/Direction Display

An indication of magnetic north is displayed on the targeting FLIR
air-to-ground displays (Figure D-16). This display is in relation to the
sensor line of sight, and can rotate as required to indicate magnetic north.

The magnetic north display is removed whenever declutter is selected.
Additionally, the display is removed if the INS and AHRS/EGI fails; or
sensor communications is invalid, in standby, or switched off.


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_28.jpeg:
Declutter (DCL) Option

The DCL option (Figure D-13) is available (on T1 only) to allow the
aircrew to remove specific display items for all A/G and A/A, T1 and T2
displays. When DCL is selected, the following items are removed from the
A/G TGT IR display:

e =6BBR (bullseye, bearing, and range)

e@ Weapon launch zones and range scale

e Weapon status/delivery data

e Targeting pod LOS lat/long data

e Magnetic heading/direction display
Manual LOS Slave/Slew

The pod LOS may be changed manually in azimuth and/or elevation via
the TDC when in the A/G submodes of slave (cue) and track.

Slave Mode

If the pod is not commanded to TRACK, it defaults to the slave submode.
In this submode, the pod LOS is ground stabilized and points toward a
particular point or area on the ground. However, there can be a slight
amount of LOS drift in this submode. To manually slave the pod LOS, the
crew member in command uses the TDC to position the LOS in azimuth
and elevation. The TGT IR can also be slaved to a position by typing a
sequence point number into the scratchpad and entering it at PB #17, or
cueing the pod from the A/G RDR or TSD. To aid in positioning the pod
LOS, a sighting index (i.e., crosshairs) is displayed on the TGT IR.

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_29.jpeg:
Track Mode

When you command TRACK (via HA on the trigger in the RCP or by auto
acq depression in the FCP), you are in the TRACK submode. To manually
change the pod LOS, the crew member in command uses the TDC to slew
the pod. Changing the pod LOS in the TRACK mode affects the
designation and is discussed in subsequent paragraphs. TRACK mode is
indicated with either ATRK or PTRK boxed at PB #10 (Figure D-16).

The direction and magnitude of slaving/slewing is indicated in the lower
left corner of the display. An arrow indicates the direction and a letter
indicates the rate (Figure D-16).

Tracking Submodes

Point Track (PTRK)

PTRK uses a point contrast video tracker that looks for IR contrast which
defines each edge/side of the target. Once an edge is found, the pod
defines this with vertical and horizontal lines in the center of the video.
PTRK is established when the target is bound with a rectangular box
centered on the display. The WHT or BHT selection at PB #5

(Figure D-17) determines what color man-made objects are to appear in
the IR scene (overall polarity). Either white or black targets may be point
tracked, depending on the target polarity tracking selection at PB #8
(Figure D-17), which will be discussed later.

The TGT IR displays two codes in the POINT TRACK MODE STATUS
WINDOW located in the lower left corner of the video display
(Figure D-17).

“P1” - The P1 cue informs the aircrew when the pod is able to track the
object in the video scene using PTRK as the selected contrast tracker.

“U1” - The U1 cue informs the aircrew when the pod is unable to track the
object in the video scene using PTRK as the selected contrast tracker.
Since it is displayed only for a brief instant when the point tracker
defaults to ATRK, it may not be seen by the aircrew.

Figure D - 17. Point Track Submode.

In the PTRK mode the targeting pod has the capability to polarity track
targets either in WHT or BHT video. The options available are WPT
(white polarity track), BPT (black polarity track), and APT (auto polarity
track). The system initializes to WPT, but is selectable either by toggling
PB #8 (Figure D-17) or by moving the RCP castle switch forward for less
than one second.

WPT commands the targeting pod to track white (green on color display)
targets within the tracking window. To enhance target contrast, all
embedded symbology is black.

BPT commands the targeting pod to track black targets within the
tracking window. To enhance target contrast, all embedded symbology is
conversely white.

APT commands the targeting pod to track either white or black targets,
depending on the color of the target at the center of the crosshairs when
PTRK is initiated. The targeting pod embedded symbology will be
opposite the color of the object being tracked. APT is only available as an
option in the A/G mode of the targeting pod.

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_32.jpeg:
Offset Track (OTRK)

When PTRK is boxed on the T1 display, the offset track submode becomes
available. OTRK can be selected (boxed) allowing you to attack a
non-IR-significant point. You must press PB #9 to box OTRK which
allows the cursor (crosshairs) to be separated from the track box. The pod
remains aimed at the IR-significant point as indicated by the track box,
but you can now move the cursor to another point (Figure D-18).

Once you designate the target under the cursor, steering is computed to
the target. You can move the cursor anywhere as long as the track box
remains in the FOV. Should you move it further, the pod reverts to area
track and ATRK appears above PB #10. This default also occurs if the
track box moves off the screen due to aircraft movement or if the pod loses
track. Ranging is to the point under the cursor. Pressing PB #9 again
returns you to PTRK.

Area Track (ATRK)

In this submode, a scene is tracked using an area correlation tracker. It
attempts to maintain this position based on a larger reference than is
used in PTRK. ATRK may be the best option for unbound targets such as
roads, railroads, bridges, etc. (Figure D-19). You can enter it anytime
from PTRK. Alternate depressions of PB #10 or depressing the RCP TDC
cycles between ATRK and PTRK.

The TARGET IR displays two codes in the AREA TRACK MODE STATUS

Point Track Default to Area Track (P/A)

If PTRK is commanded and the targeting pod is unable to acquire the
target, or PTRK is broken once established, the pod defaults to P/A, which
replaces PTRK at PB #10 (Figure D-20). This indicates the pod has
reverted to area track because the system is unable to acquire/maintain
point track. When the targeting pod is slewed with P/A displayed, it is
commanded to ATRK at the termination of the slew input, indicated at
PB #10.

Computed Rate Track (CMPT)

If PTRK or ATRK cannot be established or maintained, the pod defaults to
CMPT, as indicated at PB #10 (Figure D-21, right). In CMPT the pod is
no longer tracking the target, but attempts to keep the pod LOS pointed
at the last position tracked. Masking or clouds interfering with the LOS
to the tracked target are the most common events which cause CMPT.
Once the target is reacquired in the FOV, if the aircrew initiates a slew
input, the pod attempts to reenter PTRK or ATRK at the termination of
the slew. The pod will remain in CMPT for up to five seconds, after which
time, the pod defaults to a cue mode if track upgrade has not occurred.

Continuous Designation (CDES)
CDES is available in the PTRK, OTRK, and ATRK modes for only the
TGT and UPDT cursor functions. CDES is selectable at PB #1
(Figure D-22), and is boxed when active. The letter “C” will prefix the
current ranging sensor in priority above the selected cursor function at
PB #7 (Figure D-22).
In the TGT cursor function, CDES is only available using LAS, HRM, or
PASS as the priority sensor. Continuous designation is active while in the
TGT cursor function when all of the following conditions are satisfied.

e PTRK, ATRK, or OTRK is commanded

e CDES boxed at PB #1

e target designated via the TGT IR display

e no TDC slewing in progress; target automatically redesignates
once TDC slewing inputs terminate if previously in CDES

e LAS, HRM, or PASS sensor valid and selected
If the above conditions have been met, CLAS, CHRM, or CPASS is
displayed above TGT at PB #7 to indicate that the target is being
continuously designated using the specified sensor. CDES is interrupted
and the cues are removed above TGT at PB #7 at the occurrence of any of
the following:

e initiation of a slew command

e targeting pod enters CMPT

e = when the cursor function is changed

e the range source used (sensor in priority) becomes invalid

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_37.jpeg:
CDES LOST is displayed for up to five seconds on the TGT IR if track is

In the UPDT cursor function, CDES operates similarly to the TGT cursor
function, except UPDT allows the use of AGR as another valid ranging
sensor source and CAGR can also be displayed above UPDT at PB #7.
Errors to the MN, INS, or SYS ALT are continuously updated while CDES

is active.

Figure D - 22. ATRK Continuous Designation.

Cursor Functions

You can designate the ground point under the cursor as a target (TGT),
update the INS, MN, or ALT (UPDT), cue an AGM-65 (CUE), or create a
mark point (MARK). You can select the appropriate cursor function by
repeated depressions of PB #7, or in the RCP by moving the castle switch
left for CUE/MARK, aft for TGT, or right for UPDT. Figure D-22 shows
the TGT option selected.


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_38.jpeg:
Target

In TGT the ground point is designated as a target. This is done by placing
the point under the cursor and going full action on the RCP hand
controller trigger or depressing and releasing the TDC in the FCP.
DESIGNATE appears on the screen momentarily. Attack steering is now
available on the HUD if in the A/G master mode. With a designation,
AUTO delivery and A/G master mode selected, you will also have TPULL
or TREL displayed until weapon release. After weapon release
TPULL/TREL changes to TIMPCT (Figure D-22). If CDES is not boxed
and the operator attempts to fine tune the LOS or slews to a different
target, the target must be redesignated. In the auto bombing mode, if
AUTO or LAS is selected as the priority sensor, then laser is used if the
laser is firing and range is valid. If AGR is desired as the range source,
taking command of the TGT IR display a second time forces the radar into
AGR regardless of master mode selection as soon as the pod is slewed
within radar gimbal limits. If continuous designation is lost, CDES LOST
is indicated in the middle of the display and will be displayed for five
seconds. CDES LOST may occur at close range to the target, when target
size exceeds the track box display capability. When CDES is interrupted,
the designation remains on the last valid designation update until the
aircrew redesignates.

Cue
This option can be used to bring an AGM-65 line of sight to the TGT IR
LOS without designating a target. The same procedure as for TGT is

used, except CUE must appear above PB #7. Attack steering is not
provided on the HUD.

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_39.jpeg:
Update

The UPDT cursor function allows you to update the INS, MN, or system
altitude. Cue the target pod to a well defined sequence point, like a
man-made object with vertical development, and select the update cursor
function. It is essential that the correct sequence point be indicated at

PB #17. At this time you can select either the MN, INS, or ALT for
update by toggling PB #16 to the desired update function. Manually slave
the pod line of sight over the update point. Once valid ranging is
established, position/altitude errors are displayed at PB #16

(Figure D-28).

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_40.jpeg:
Position errors greater than 3000 feet are displayed in nautical miles.
Altitude errors are displayed in feet. A large error may indicate a
procedural error. You can command track (either PTRK or ATRK) if
desired. To obtain the most accurate ranging information, the laser
should be firing for the update; however, if the laser is safe or laser
ranging becomes invalid, then radar ranging data (AGR) is used if
available. Regardless of the priority sensor selection, the AGR is slaved to
the target pod LOS immediately if a second take command of the TGT IR
display is accomplished. This means that if the radar is operating (and is
not in either SNIFF, MRM support, or an acquisition mode), it is
commanded to AGR and slewed to the target pod LOS as soon as UPDT is
selected at PB #7 and the cursor is slewed or an update is commanded.
When you are confident that the pod is tracking the correct sequence point
and is using optimum ranging, accept the update by squeezing the hand
controller trigger to full action (RCP) or depressing/releasing the TDC
(FCP).

The update is successful if INS REJECT or INVALID is not displayed
with INS at PB #16. If you are updating the MN and mistakenly accept a
large update error, reset the MN on the UFC update select submenu. The
INS is protected against most update errors by the Kalman filter. The
MN accepts 100% of your update.

Mark

The MARK cursor function allows you to create mark points from the TGT
IR display. To create a mark point, select the MARK cursor function at
PB #7 by stepping through the cursor functions using PB #7 or by a left
movement of the RCP hand controller castle switch (left movement of the
castle switch toggles between CUE and MARK). The mark point is
created by depressing and releasing the FCP TDC or by full action on the
RCP hand controller trigger. “MARK XX” displays for five seconds in the
center of the TGT IR display (Figure D-24) and the mark point data is
stored in the CC buffer. It can also be written to the data transfer module
and is displayed on the UFC of the cockpit from which the point is created.
The mark point symbol will not be displayed on the TGT IR display. The
air-to-ground radar is commanded after mark point designation if the
targeting pod LOS is within the radar gimbal limits, and there is no
higher priority request for the AGR (track or acquisition mode). AGR
control in MARK is similar to UPDT.

Cue Modes

There are several methods available to the aircrew to cue the targeting
pod. Listed below are the types of sensors or sources used to aim the pod
and their associated legends.

RDR

TSD

NAV

HUD

LAN-3

Targeting pod cued from A/G RDR display. If the mission
sequence point under PB #17 on the A/G RDR display is not a
target offset, the pod will be cued to that point upon target
designation. If it is a target offset, the pod will be cued to the
actual target. In the cue cursor function the pod will cue to any
point under the crosshairs, regardless of the syntax at PB #17.
However, in the cue mode, AUTO sensor must be selected, or
LAS must be included in the MAN sensor hierarchy if that is to
be used.

Targeting pod cued from the TSD. When selecting FLIR at

PB #7 on the TSD, an arrowhead appears on the sensor pointing
cue. After slewing the arrowhead over the selected map area,
commanding FA on the RCP HC trigger, or TDC press/release
on the FCP throttle, will cue the pod to that point.

Targeting pod cued from NAV designation or quickstep method.
Four methods exist for the aircrew to NAV cue the pod on the
TGT IR display. Pressing PB #17 will sequence through all
mission points on the route. Selecting quickstep (FCP coolie up,
or RCP castle switch depress) sequences to the closest point
forward of the aircraft within 20 nm on the current route. If
there are no points forward of the aircraft within 20 nm, a SP
will be displayed at PB #17. Thereafter, quickstep numerically
selects the next mission point in sequence. The aircrew may
also type in a mission point in the UFC scratchpad and enter it
at PB #17.

Targeting pod cued from the HUD TD diamond. When the pilot
is in command of the HUD and either AUTO sensor is selected
or LAS is included in the MAN sensor hierarchy, the pod LOS is
slaved to the HUD TD diamond when a HUD designation occurs
or follows the pilot’s slew inputs without a designation.


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_43.jpeg:
RET

STAB

SP

Targeting pod slaved to the A/G reticle. The pilot must be in
command of the HUD and take command a second time to cue
the pod to the A/G HUD reticle LOS. AUTO sensor must be
selected, or LAS must be included in the MAN sensor hierarchy,
with the pod in the A/G mode and not in any track mode.

Targeting pod commanded to space stabilized mode. The STAB
mode is considered a special type of cue mode. STAB is
displayed at PB #17 either by typing in zero on the UFC
scratchpad and entering it at PB #17, or holding the mode reject
switch (RCP) or auto acq switch (FCP) forward for greater than
one second. In either case, the pod LOS is commanded to a
three-degree down, zero-degree azimuth position, and is referred
to as the “snowplow” mode of operation (Figure D-25). Once in
snowplow, TDC inputs can be used to modify the space
stabilized LOS, but STAB will remain displayed at PB #17. If
the aircrew wishes to space stabilize the pod without initially
going to snowplow, holding aft on the mode reject switch (RCP)
or auto acq switch (FCP) for greater than one second will also
enter STAB at the current pod LOS. STAB is exited when either
track is commanded, the pod is cued by another source, MARK
or CUE designation occurs, or ground stabilization is
commanded via HOTAS.

Targeting pod commanded to ground stabilized mode. Holding
aft on the mode reject switch for greater than one second not
only enters the current pod LOS to STAB, but alternately selects
the ground stabilization mode and attempts to keep the pod LOS
on the point under the crosshairs without entering track. SP is
displayed at PB #17 when this mode is entered.


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_44.jpeg:
The cue mode legends are displayed below the mission sequence point
under PB #17; or in the case of STAB or SP, directly under PB #17. The
targeting pod initializes to the wide field of view (WFOV) at power-up,
upon changing operating modes at PB #6 (A/A or A/G), or when cued using
any of the methods listed above. After cueing, TDC inputs to refine the
pod LOS varies depending on aircraft motion or position relative to the
ground point. The above modes are exited upon designation, or in the case
of the space stabilization mode, once STAB is exited. Below are the
legends displayed when these two things occur:

Laser Operation

The laser is primarily utilized for the delivery of laser guided munitions,
but it is also used to provide accurate ranging information for system
updates, target designations, and weapons release computations. There is
only one laser transmitter, but filtering techniques may be applied to
create either an eyesafe training mode (1.54 micron wavelength at 8
millijoules) or a tactical mode (1.06 micron wavelength at 100 millijoules)
of operation. The tactical laser is capable of ranging up to 13.2 nm with
an accuracy of 20 feet, while the training laser is limited to 3.5 nm when
the visibility is greater than 12 nm. Selection between modes is
accomplished on preflight by means of a mechanical switch on the exterior
of the targeting pod. A green (1.54) indication in the window means the
training mode is selected, while red (1.06) indicates that the tactical mode
is selected. It is not aircrew selectable once airborne. A “T” displayed on
the laser status window is also an indication the pod is in the training
mode.

Laser Arm
The laser is armed from the RCP TGT IR sensor control panel. Armed
indicators include ARM displayed at PB #19, an “L” displayed on the laser
status window (Figure D-26), a diamond placed over the HUD gun cross,
and an illuminated LASER ARMED advisory light in the FCP. It cannot
be armed until the following requirements are met.

e Laser arm switch in ARM

e Valid laser code entered

e Weight off wheels (WOW) and landing gear handle up

e System altitude less than 25,000 feet


Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_46.jpeg:
Laser Code

The laser is capable of emitting pulses at a PRF up to and including 20
pulses per second. The laser electronics is also capable of modulating the
emitted pulsed energy by transferring coded data from the pulse interval
modulator (PIM) module, which is selectively loaded onto the targeting
pod located on the BIT maintenance panel. A valid laser code is displayed
under the laser status at PB #19 (Figure D-26). An invalid laser code
flashes at PB #19 when the targeting pod is in operate with the laser
switch in SAFE or ARM. Specific codes are also assigned for types of laser
guided bombs, which is covered in a later lesson. Laser codes are keyed on
the UFC scratchpad and entered at PB #19 once the pod is in STBY or
ON. Any laser code ranging from 1XXX to 2XXX (X = 1-8) is valid for both
the tactical (combat) or training laser modes. Codes beginning with 1 are
used for PRF modulation, while codes beginning with 2 are used for PIM.
If a 2XXX code is entered the targeting pod itself must contain the PIM
module, otherwise the tactical laser will not arm or fire.

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_47.jpeg:
Laser Status

The TGT IR indicates the status of the laser in three different areas on
the display. First at PB #19, one of the following syntax may be displayed
(Figure D-27):

SAFE The laser switch is in SAFE, or in ARM but the aircraft is above
25,000 feet system altitude and has automatically safed the
laser.

ARM The laser switch is in ARM, but is not firing.
LASE The laser is firing; “LASE” also flashes when firing.

MASK _ The laser has been commanded to fire, but has been inhibited
due to the LOS being obscured by the aircraft structure. MASK
will only appear when LOS is obscured during LASE operation.
The TGT IR will reinitialize to LASE once the masking condition
is exited.

Secondly, at PB #20, under the azimuth and elevation values, the ranging
source will indicate whether or not the laser reflected energy is being
received and processed through the TGT IR pod (Figure D-27).

The laser status window located on the lower right corner of the TGT IR
display (Figure D-27) is the third indication of laser status. There are
three codes that may be displayed individually, or in conjunction with one
another and are listed below.

“T” - TRAINING LASER CUE. Displayed when the eyesafe training mode
has been selected. If the combat tactical laser is selected, the “T” is not
displayed.

“L” - LASER ARM CUE. Displayed on and steady when the laser switch
is set to ARM. Flashes when the laser is firing.

“M” - LASER MASK CUE. Displayed in conjunction with the MASK cue
at PB #19 to indicate LOS has been obscured. The laser is inhibited from
firing and the flashing “L” will become steady when “M” is displayed.
Flashing crosshairs are an early warning signal to the aircrew that a
masking condition is developing within 5° of mask zone.

NOTE

WARNING

Along the laser main beam LOS, the
tactical laser can be hazardous to
personnel on the ground or in other
aircraft within approximately 12 nm.

Do not fire the tactical laser within 1000
feet of personnel or other aircraft.
Reflected sidelobe energy may cause eye
damage. Never lase inhabited areas.

CAUTION

The targeting pod may be fired up to
25,000 feet system altitude. Above
25,000 feet system altitude, the targeting
pod protects itself and will not arm or
fire. Any attempt to arm or fire the laser
above 25,000 feet system altitude results
in the following: TGT IR display
symbology indicates SAFE, L does not
appear, and the laser will not arm or fire.
The laser arm switch may be placed in
ARM between 25,000 and 40,000 feet
with no negative consequences. In this
situation the laser will arm when the
aircraft descends below 25,000 feet.

The training laser is not suitable for employment of laser guided

munitions.

NOTE

LANTIRN pods must be turned off above 40,000 feet or if greater than
Mach 1.2 or 650 KCAS to prevent damage.

Auto/Manual Lase

The aircrew can manually lase (MLAS) or have the targeting pod
automatically lase (ALAS) the target during a laser guided bomb (LGB)
weapons delivery profile. To program a manual or auto lase time, the
aircrew must first select a LGB or SUU-20 in the A/G PACS. Once this is
accomplished, the aircrew needs to go to an A/G delivery display and enter
the PROG PAGE by depressing PB #1. The current MLAS/ALAS
programmed time will be displayed above PB #8 (Figure D-28). Allowable
lase times range from 0:01 to 1:30, or CONT (continuous). Toggling PB #8
with a blank UFC scratchpad alternates between MLAS and ALAS. To
input a time, simply type the number of seconds on the UFC, up to 1:30,
and depress PB #8. If colons are used, two numeric digits must be added
prior to entering or it will flash on the scratchpad as an invalid input. If
CONT lase is desired, simply type “C” on the UFC scratchpad and enter at
PB #8.

NOTE

Only lase times of 12, 15, 20 seconds, or CONT can be selected for the
GBU-24.

Once the lase times have been programmed, the aircrew must select
either a MLAS or ALAS function on the TGT IR display at PB #18 while
in the A/G mode (Figure D-29). During MLAS operation, the time input
and displayed is just a visual cue to remind the aircrew of desired
terminal laser fire guidance time. The aircrew must still manually
actuate laser fire via HOTAS. During ALAS operation, the laser will
automatically fire when the programmed time matches TIMPCT, and will
continue to fire until either TIMPCT terminates (--) plus 10 seconds (or
10% of the total TOF of the weapon, whichever greater), or the aircrew
manually terminates laser fire via HOTAS or switches laser to SAFE.
MLAS or ALAS times are displayed above the sighting index (crosshairs)
to the left, while TREL or TPULL (prior to weapons release) and TIMPCT
(after release), are displayed directly above the crosshairs (Figure D-29).
In both operating modes the laser must be armed and the aircrew must
ensure the target is continuously being tracked via the crosshairs until
weapons impact.

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_53.jpeg:
A typical ALAS profile is outlined below.

e Target acquired and tracked via TGT IR display. ALAS selected
at PB #18 with a programmed time of 0:15.

e Aircrew manually fires laser for update, redesignation, and
accurate ranging for weapons release.

e At TREL = 0, weapon is released with a TIMPCT of 0:25
displayed, and the laser is turned off automatically. “ALAS” at
PB #18 begins flashing, indicating that the laser is being
controlled automatically.

@ When TIMPCT counts down through 0:15 (for the last weapon
released in a ripple delivery) the laser automatically turns back
on.

e At the termination of TIMPCT (--) plus 10 seconds or 10%
(normally 10 seconds, unless you drop a weapon with a TOF
greater than 100 seconds), the laser is automatically turned off.
Aircrew will probably manually turn off the laser via HOTAS
once impact is observed (“splash”) to preclude the laser from
wandering and interfering with other weapons being guided in
the target area.

ALAS is displayed steady prior to weapons release, and upon actuation of
the laser fire button, the laser will turn on and off. When “ALAS” is
flashing with a LGB in flight, any actuation of the laser fire button will
revert the targeting pod to the MLAS mode of operation. If the laser is
firing at the time of button actuation, the laser will be turned off
immediately. If the laser is off with “ALAS” flashing, the laser will be
turned on immediately, but since it will be in the MLAS mode, the aircrew
must now remember to turn the laser off manually. If PB #18 is toggled
while ALAS is flashing, it will revert to MLAS with laser off, regardless of
laser status at that moment. ALAS remains active in masking conditions,
and will resume laser fire once the masking condition is exited.

NOTE

When “MASK” is displayed at PB #19, the laser is being commanded to
fire, and only inhibited due to the masking condition. Once masking is
exited, the laser will continue to fire. If the laser has been commanded to
stop fire while in a masking condition, “ARM” rather than “MASK” will be
displayed at PB #19.



Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_54.jpeg:
If the targeting pod is in the MLAS mode with a LGB already in flight,
and the aircrew toggles PB #18 to ALAS, ALAS begins to flash and the
laser will fire immediately if the ALAS time is greater than TIMPCT, or
will turn on according to the ALAS profile. Proper setup of the TGT IR
display prior to weapons release will preclude having to make these type
of switch changes.

Targeting Pod Malfunctions

TGT POD HOT Caution

The TGT POD HOT caution legend appears on the MPD/MPCD, where
other cautions appear, to indicate that the pod is overheating

(Figure D-30). Turn the TGT FLIR off for 1 minute, then on. If the
overheat condition returns, turn the TGT FLIR off. Continued use will
result in internal damage and failure.

Laser Failure

To aid the aircrew in determining if the laser is operational, the word
FAIL is displayed below PB #19 and LASER FAIL is continuously
displayed in the lower message window (on all the A/A and A/G T1 and T2
displays) whenever the targeting pod reports any of the following laser
BIT failures:

e LASER XMTR
e LASER HVPS
e LASER RANGER

The display of FAIL and LASER FAIL is not dependent on the current
laser status (SAFE, ARM, LASE) displayed at PB #19 (Figure D-31). The
display of FAIL is not dependent on the current targeting pod mode (OFF,
STBY, OPR, RDY, NRDY); however, LASER FAIL can only be displayed
after the targeting pod has unstowed and one of the three previously
mentioned failures exists. (All other five-second cues displayed in the
lower message window have priority over LASER FAIL.) The aircrew can
acknowledge and remove the LASER FAIL cue by pressing PB #19 with
an empty scratchpad. If LASER FAIL is selected for removal and at least
one of the failures still exists, the cue does not reappear when additional
failures occur or disappear, but does reappear if the targeting pod power
status changes or if PB #19 is pressed with an empty scratchpad.
Additionally, if the aircrew attempts to fire the laser after the LASER
FAIL cue has been removed, the cue reappears.

IR PLANNING

Mission planning for IR sensors is more technical than radar planning and
may require the support of professional weather personnel experienced in
the use of the tactical decision aid (TDA) computerized planning model.
This model provides the crew with a prediction of IR sensor effective
ranges for the LANTIRN navigation pod, targeting pod, and IR weapons
under various conditions. This information is critical for low-level pacing
and for determining the appropriate ranges for target attack maneuvers.
Aircrews have to make the appropriate inputs to weather personnel and
plan mission events based on the information provided. Additionally,
aircrews should be able to determine approximate sensor ranges based on
Delta T and transmissivity values provided by weather personnel.

A sample planning flimsy is shown in Figure D-32.

Table D-2 provides a detection range once the Delta T and transmissivity
are known. In addition to determining the approximate range at which
detection occurs, it is also important to consider the types of points to be
selected during targeting pod updates. Vertically developed objects such
as buildings, water tanks, and towers are suitable update points.
Experience has shown that objects close to course are easier to track with
the targeting pod since the angular change during slewing is primarily in
elevation as the aircraft nears the point. The targeting pod handles
elevation changes fairly well. Update points well off the course line
(greater than 2 nm) present rapid azimuth changes as the aircraft
approaches the point and makes initial tracking difficult. The targeting
pod does not slew as well with rapid azimuth changes.

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_62.jpeg:
Target IR Planning

A successful attack or LGB delivery using the TGT IR for designations
and deliveries or updates starts on the ground with TGT study and TGT
FOV predictions. Using the TDA from the weather shop is the first tool in
determining what IR conditions, and therefore, pickup ranges you can
expect.

The next step is determining what you can expect to see in the targeting
pod once you start using it for either updates or attacks. Just like radar
work, you have to come up with FOV prediction for the TGT IR. The
principles are basically the same; you have to work big-to-small if you
want to find your exact DMPI or update point.

The big differences between TGT IR and radar prediction is in TGT IR you
are looking for objects with different temperature signatures as compared
to radar where you are looking for higher energy reflections. Unlike radar
predictions, the footprint of a TGT IR prediction and what you actually see
on the scope is not the same in width and length. For example, if you are
at 10,000 feet AGL and you take a radar patch map (DW-3.3) of a TGT or
aim point which is 10 miles away, you always get a map that covers a
ground distance 3.3 miles wide and 3.3 miles long. If you take a look in
the TGT IR at the same point, the picture you will see on your scope would
cover a ground distance of 6307 feet in width in the middle of the display
and a length of 48,060 feet or 7.1 miles.

Since the picture that you see on your display is the “same” length and
width, you are looking at a compressed picture in length compared to its
width. This is caused by looking at the ground with a circular sensor at
an angle of less than 90 degrees as if you would take a flashlight and
shine it onto the ground. If you look down at an angle of 90 degrees, the
picture would be a circle; if you aim at an angle, you would get an
oval-shaped picture. The shallower the angle gets or the lower you fly, the
more ground distance you cover in length up to a point where you look
into infinity and you have the horizon in the top part of your TGT IR
(Figure D-38).

Text from LAN-3_Targeting_IR_page_64.jpeg:
If you are a math major you probably take pride in figuring out these
distances through trigonometric formulas. Fortunately both squadrons
have programs called TGT Pod FOV Simulator on their computers. You
just insert a ground range and altitude and get all distances and angles
needed to make a good FOV prediction (Figure D-34). Next let us look at
an example on how to actually work with all these tools. You are
supposed to attack a building—Tryon Palace—in the town of New Bern.
You are coming home from Dare at 10,000 feet and with a heading of 260°.
The weather is good and you can expect IR pickup ranges in excess of

10 miles. Usually you would ask for a TDA as described in the previous
paragraph to find out what ranges you can expect. In this example or
with good IR visibility, you typically would make a prediction for a range
to TGT of about 30 seconds TREL or between 5 to 10 miles for a medium
level delivery.

First you need to get a map or an AFMSS imagery of the target area and
plot out the coordinates. Get a FOV prediction from the computers
(Figure D-34). Next, draw a radar prediction of the target area (you
always want to start out with a radar designation) (Figure D-35).

After that is done, plot the TGT FOVs on either the AFMSS printout or
the 50,000 map. Always start at your DMPI and work from there. A good
technique is to divide the footprint into quarters and then divide those
into thirds up and down. It should look like a puzzle that is finished after
you are done with that (Figure D-36, top).

Now you can do the same roster with equal squares on the FOV sheet
(Figure D-36, bottom left) and start copying the individual squares from
the map onto the FOV sheet (Figure D-36, bottom right). The result
should look like the picture in Figure D-37.

TEXT
INTRODUCTION

The targeting IR (TGT IR) system, or sometimes referred to as the target
FLIR (TGT FLIR), is the other half of the F-15E’s infrared, “see in the
dark” capability. You can use it to update system altitude, INS, or MN
present position; to designate and attack a target; to hand off to an IR
Maverick; and even to buddy lase for another attacker. Its high resolution
presentation gives a television-like picture, making most features readily
identifiable. It can be pointed by the mission navigator but because of its
limited field of view and range, it is best aimed (cued) by the radar. You
can command automatic cueing or manually slave the pod.

DESCRIPTION
Pod

Carried on its pylon on the underside of the left engine area, the TGT IR
pod (with adapter) weighs about 621 lbs (525 lbs without the adapter)
(Figure D-1). It contains the IR sensor, a pockels cell, Q-switched
Neodymium doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, power
supply, environmental control unit, and associated computers/control
units. In general, it “looks” down/aft in a hemisphere relative to the
fuselage line and wingline with an aft blind zone caused by the pod itself
(Figure D-2). It can also “look” up but aircraft surfaces, external stores,
and the NAV pod limit the view.

AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_10.jpeg:
When the TFR detects terrain in a bar scan, it stores the range and
elevation of that return in memory. Between scans of that bar, it
estimates the range and elevation of the terrain by using the aircraft’s
groundspeed and flight vector provided by the INS. A complete 8-bar scan
requires 2.5 seconds. In wings level flight, the center bar is scanned twice,
once every 1.25 seconds.

In certain TFR modes, the scan pattern is modified to provide different
capabilities. Those differences will be discussed in LAN-6.

TF Command Logic

Once the returns from the TF radar are stored in memory, the TF
computer in the LANTIRN NAV Pod uses them to compute the g
command required to maintain the SC. The TF computer compares the
stored terrain information with a model of “command lines.” The lines
represent the incremental g required to cross an obstacle at the SC. As
the aircraft flies over level ground in Figure D-3, the ground returns
coincide with the zero command line. This indicates no incremental g is
required to maintain SC.

The peak in Figure D-4 eventually penetrates the zero command line
(ZCL), indicating that a positive incremental g command is required to
maintain SC. The further the terrain penetrates through the ZCL, the
greater the g command required to maintain the selected clearance, as
shown by the +1 G and +2 G lines. As the aircraft clears the peak, the
terrain on the far side will fall in the negative G region, indicating that a
pushover command is required to maintain SC.

The clearance monitor region is an area in front of the aircraft monitored
by the TF computer. Any object entering the area will generate a fly-up
command by the TF computer.

TF Command Corridor

The TF computer stores terrain information from all bars in the scan. Not
all of that information is necessary for generating TF commands. The
only terrain that requires climb or dive commands is that which falls
along the flight vector. To prevent unnecessary climb commands for
terrain left or right of the aircraft’s flight path, the TF computer
determines a “command corridor” based on the aircraft's projected
groundtrack.

In wings level flight, the command corridor consists only of the center bar.
When the aircraft begins a turn, the command corridor shifts to include
some or all of the other bars in the direction of the turn as shown in
Figure D-6. The number of bars included depends on the groundspeed
and turn rate. The TF computer now generates commands based on the
composite of terrain from all bars within the command corridor.

Radar Altimeter Commands

At times, such as flying over smooth water or dry lakes, there may be no
TF radar returns to provide a g command. In these circumstances, the
“NO TERRAIN” caution will be displayed and the TF computer uses the
radar altimeter to compute the required g command by comparing current
radar altitude to SC.

E-SCOPE PRESENTATION

The format for displaying TFR returns is known as an E-scope. An
E-scope display is very similar to the B-scope used for air-to-air radars,
with two important differences. First, the E-scope displays elevation
versus range instead of azimuth versus range. Second, the range scale on
the E-scope is nonlinear. The E-scope in the F-15E has a maximum
display range of 10 nm, but the first 2 nm take up almost half of the
display. This apparent “range distortion” provides greater detail of the
terrain closest to the aircraft since that is the terrain most likely to
produce “g” commands.

LAN-4 D-8


Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_15.jpeg:
The shape of the returns of an E-scope can best be understood by
constructing the returns for a simple case such as the one shown in Figure
D-7. The aircraft in this diagram is flying at 1000 feet AGL and is
approaching a 1000-foot hill. Assuming the aircraft is in level flight, the
TFR antenna is scanning +10° and -20° relative to the flight vector. Since
the terrain between the aircraft and the hill is flat, we can use simple

trigonometry to compute the range at which a given scan angle intersects
the ground.

its scan angle is different. This results in a “spike” on the E-scope. If all
the returns are plotted and connected, you get the curved display as seen

TF DISPLAY INTERPRETATION

The TF display has several important functions. It provides an overall
“confidence check” that the TF system is operating properly, permits the
crew to anticipate climb or dive commands, and allows detection of
weather and electronic countermeasures. Your ability to interpret it
quickly is essential to your success in TFR operations. This section
discusses the basic elements of the TF display and how they relate to
terrain returns.

Zero Command Line

The zero command line (ZCL) is a graphic representation of the zero
incremental g line that the TF computer uses as a command model

(Figure D-9).

It is an indication of where the aircraft is flying relative to the SC. Ifthe
ground is coincident with the zero command line, i.e., moving from right to
left along the zero command line, the aircraft is at the desired SC for that
particular distance and there is no change in the present g’s being
commanded. If the ground is to the right of the zero command line, the
aircraft is flying high. If the ground is to the left, the aircraft is low. The
ZCL is dynamic and changes as SC and ground speed change (Figure D-10
and Figure D-11).

Obstacle Warning Line (OWL)

This line is located to the left of the zero command line (Figure D-12). Its
purpose is to provide you with a warning of approaching terrain that
requires 2 Gs to clear (keeping in mind that 2 incremental Gs is the limit
of normal TF operations). If the synthetic video penetrates this line, the
voice warning, OBSTACLE AHEAD is activated and continues until the
aircraft has climbed to where the terrain returns below the OWL.

This line depicts the flight path of the aircraft (Figure D-12). It is
dynamic as it travels up and down the display portraying climbs and
dives. It provides the same type of information concerning the aircraft’s
relationship to the ground as the velocity vector does in the HUD except
that on the TF display you can also determine the range at which your
flight path intersects the ground. During a TF climb to clear high terrain,
such as a peak, the flight vector line provides an immediate crosscheck
that the TF command will provide terrain clearance.

TF Raw Video Position Indicator

At the top right of the TF display is a raw video position indicator (Figure
D-13). The dot on this scale represents the azimuth of the TF bar scan
from which the raw video is selected. The indicated bar is the center bar
when straight and level, and the outside bar of the command corridor
when in a turn. The raw video position indicator provides a confidence
check that the command corridor and lead-into-turn features are
functioning properly. As the aircraft begins a turn the dot should shift in
the direction of the turn.

Pitch Command and Attitude

At the top left portion of the display is the command steering and attitude

The MEA is always displayed on the E-scope display while operating
during terrain following (Figure D-13). The MEA can be set in 1-foot
increments from 400 to 30,000 feet via the UFC or through AFMSS, and
loaded into the MC/DTM. MEA values are zeroed out and MEA OFF is
displayed on the TF display when no MEA has been entered in the UFC
point data submenu. The MEA displayed will be for the current aircraft
sequence point.

Terrain Video

There are two types of terrain video displayed; one is synthetic, and the
other is raw. Synthetic is video stored by the TF computer and displayed
at full intensity out to 6 nm. As seen in Figure D-14, it contains terrain
data along the projected flight path of the aircraft and is updated every
0.5 seconds. All terrain following commands are generated from this
video. Raw video is displayed at half intensity out to 10 nm. Raw returns
are updated every 1.25 seconds during straight and level flight and every
2.5 seconds during turns. Raw video provides the crew with confidence of
proper TF radar operation, and is also used to detect weather and
jamming. The displayed raw video comes from only one selected bar; the
center bar when wings are level and the outer bar of the command
corridor when turning.

Different terrain features produce different displays. Lakes, sand dunes,

extended through the NO-SHOW, would join into a continuous smooth

curve, similar to level ground.

Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_24.jpeg:
Mountainous terrain or hills produce spikes in the video. If there is a hill,
the display has a spike followed by a shadow (blank area). The terrain
behind the hill produces returns at the line-of-sight angle (Figure D-17).
Valleys produce displays that have shadows, however the returns display
at a lower angle and a greater range.

From a practical standpoint, the TF display produces a series of spikes
and shadows as the terrain changes. If the ground returns, mountains,
valleys, or level ground ride along the ZCL, you are at the correct altitude.
If the returns penetrate the ZCL, anticipate a climb command. Ifthe
ground returns are to the right of the ZCL anticipate a descent command.
If the returns have penetrated the ZCL and are rapidly approaching the
OWL, anticipate a flyup command when the returns penetrate the OWL.
You can use the velocity vector to determine the point where the current
aircraft flight vector would impact the ground if nothing were to change.

MANUAL, AUTO AND BLENDED TFR

The aircrew can select manual, auto or blended TF operations to follow
the TFR command steering. During manual TF operations, the pilot
manually flies the command steering by centering the velocity vector in
the manual terrain following box (MTF Box). During auto TF operations,
the TF system is coupled to the autopilot and the AFCS flies the command
steering. During coupled altitude hold and terrain following (blended)
mode, the aircrew designates an altitude (radar or baro) to maintain until
the terrain is within TF minimums. At this point AUTO TFR takes over
until the obstacle is cleared. The aircraft then recovers to the preset
RADAR or BARO altitude.

Manual TF operation can be performed in an armed or unarmed condition.
Armed manual provides a fail-safe protection that automatically flies the
aircraft away from the ground when a system failure or unsafe condition
exists. Unarmed manual provides flyup cues but does not automatically
fly the aircraft away from the ground.

During auto TF, automatic flyup protection is always provided, again
automatically flying the aircraft away from the ground. Fail-safe flyups
and TFR operations will be addressed in LAN-6 and LAN-7.

TFR INTERFACES
Displays Crosscheck

TFR information is presented on the HUD, HUD repeater, ADI and the
TF display. The HUD is the primary display for TF operations. The
combination of NAV FLIR video and TFR command steering allows for a
big picture understanding of the TF environment and flexible tactics, and
terrain masking. Although the UFC may be used to change the SC, the
TF display is the best source for TF parameter controls and is used to aid
in the interpretation of terrain and flight path corrections needed during
TFR flight. The ADI is especially useful anytime the HUD attitude
information is difficult to interpret (e.g., recovery from a loft maneuver).


Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_26.jpeg:
Systems Interface

TF COMPUTER

The TF computer receives information from the INS, TF radar and radar
altimeter to determine the appropriate vertical g-command to maintain
the selected clearance. This value is used to provide a g-command to the
automatic flight control system (AFCS) while in auto TF, or to provide
pitch steering in manual TF.

CC/MPDP

The CC generates the appropriate steering symbols, cautions and
warnings. The MPDP provides the power to the display and is the backup
to the CC in controlling mux bus messages during manual TF.

FCC

The FCC allows the engagement/disengagement and interruption of
armed TF (manual or auto). The FCC controls basic CAS actuator and
sensor operation, and responds to signals coming into the AFCS. These
signals include the TF couple, flyup enable and radar altimeter override
switch positions. In addition, the FCC performs several monitoring
functions. These functions are: a low altitude monitor (LAM), flight path
angle monitor (FPAM), and an airspeed monitor. The FCC is also the
source of flyup commands in auto and armed manual TFR. Flyups are
discussed further in LAN-6.

INS

INS data must be valid for proper TF operation. The data provided and
compared is vertical velocity, pitch attitude and roll attitude. If both sets
of data are invalid, then a subsequent flyup is generated using AHRS

attitudes for reference.

Radar Altimeter

The radar altimeter is used by the NAV pod for altitude and terrain
information when the TF radar does not see terrain. AIUs pass radar
altimeter information from the radar altimeter to the TF computer and
FCC. Data from both AIUs must be valid at 500 feet and below. The
lesser of the two AIUs altitudes is used in the FCC's TF logic and the low
altitude monitoring system. If the two altitudes differ by more than 30
feet at SCs below 500 feet, radar altitude is considered invalid and a flyup
results.

The information used to fly manual or auto TF comes from several
subsystems and a basic understanding of this interfacing is helpful. But a
solid understanding of TF principles, E-scope presentation and
interpretation is fundamental for safe terrain following operations.

LANTIRN OVERVIEW
F-15E Terrain Following Capability

The navigation pod contains the NAV FLIR, which allows the crew to
“see” ahead at night, and a terrain following radar (TFR) which provides
manual and automatic TF capabilities. This workbook addresses the TFR
logic and displays; however, it is important to recognize the TFR and NAV
FLIR are used together during TFR operations. Most of the time the
aircrew will reference the FLIR image and fly the TFR symbology
commands displayed in the HUD.

TFR Associated Systems

The primary associated systems for TF operations are the NAV pod,
AFCS, radar altimeter, AIUs and the central computer (CC). The TF
computer receives information from the INS, TF radar and radar
altimeter. It then determines the appropriate vertical g command, which
is sent to the automatic flight control system (AFCS) while in auto TF or
depicted by a pitch command box in manual TF. The CC displays the
appropriate steering symbols, cautions and warnings on the HUD/ HUD
repeater, ADI and TF displays.

TFR PRINCIPLES

The purpose of a terrain following radar system is to scan the terrain
ahead of the aircraft, determine which terrain will fall in the projected
flight path, and generate climb and dive commands to maintain the
selected reference altitude. This selected reference altitude is known as
the set clearance limit, or SC. This section explains the nature of a TF
radar scan, and how the returns from that radar are used to generate
command steering.


Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_8.jpeg:
TF Radar Scan

The TFR scans in both a vertical (“nodding”) and a horizontal (“sweeping”)
plane relative to the earth, using a 5.5° beam of pulsed energy to detect
obstacles within the scan. In the normal mode, the antenna scans in
elevation from +10° to -20°, referenced to the velocity vector in a climb or
level flight, and referenced to % the dive angle in a dive (Figure D-1).

Text from LAN-4_TFR_Introduction_page_9.jpeg:
The antenna sweeps a total of 30°: 15° left and 15° right of the flight
vector in an 8-bar raster. As the aircraft turns, the TF system shifts the
antenna coverage to provide more information in the direction of turn
providing “Lead into Turn” capabilities (Figure D-2).

TF Couple Switch

The TF couple switch (Figure D-5), located on the CAS panel, is a
two-position over-center toggle switch. It is used to select auto TF (ATF)
by coupling the terrain following climb/dive commands to the automatic
flight control system (AFCS). Switch positions are:

OFF Automatic terrain following is not activated.

COUPLE Couples the TF system to the autopilot. Basic
autopilot is automatically engaged.

Paddle Switch

Located at the base of each control stick, the paddle switch (Figure D-6) is
a two-position switch, spring-loaded to off. When airborne, depressing and
holding the paddle switch returns the system to unarmed manual TF from
auto or armed manual TF. It also disengages the auto flyup, and
disengages the steer mode in use, if one is coupled.

TF status is indicated on Menu 1, adjacent to PB #4 (Figure D-7). System
status/mode selection is displayed to the right of “TF.” It reads OFF with
the TF radar switch in OFF. After selecting STBY on the TF RDR switch,
N/R (not ready) is displayed during the 3 minute warm-up period. STBY
is displayed when the TF has completed warm-up. After the warm-up
cycle and the TF radar switch is placed to ON, the selected mode of
operation (NORM, ECCM, WX1, WX2, LPI, VLC) is displayed. When ATF
is selected, “TF” is also displayed to the right of “A/P” on the UFC.

Text from LAN-5_TFR_Controls_and_Displays_page_14.jpeg:
The set clearance (SC) can be selected through the UFC on Menu 1 by
typing the desired altitude into the scratchpad and pressing PB #4. The
mode is replaced by the previously selected SC value, which in turn is
replaced by the new flashing SC value for five seconds. Then, the original
mode/status returns. If the entry is invalid (e.g., 350 feet), the scratchpad
flashes.

The other method of selecting set clearance is via the TF display, and is
discussed in the next section.

TF DISPLAY CONTROLS

The TF display, when selected on the desired MPD/MPCD (Figure D-8),
contains the primary controls to define desired TF operation (Figure D-8).
SC, TF frequency, mode of operation, or ride can be selected as follows.

Set Clearance - The SC may be selected by depressing the pushbutton
adjacent to the desired altitude; e.g., pressing PB #18 selects 400 feet.
The 100 feet SC does not appear as an option until VLC has been selected.
(As discussed in the previous section, the SC may also be selected via
Menu 1 on the UFC.)

Frequency - Eight different TF radar frequencies can be selected. F1 is
shown in this example. Press PB #8 to increase the frequency and PB #4
to decrease it. (Rollover does not occur - to move from frequency 8 to
frequency 1, use PB #4.)

Mode - Six different modes of TF operation are selected by depressing one
of the buttons at the bottom of the display. A box appears around the
selected mode (NORM, ECCM, WX1, WX2, LPI and VLC).

Ride - Hard or soft ride is selected by pressing PB #5. (HARD or SOFT

alternates with each depression.) The positive G limit is the same for both
ride selections, but the negative G limit differs.

HUD

In manual TF, a steering box appears. To maintain the SC, keep the
velocity vector in the box. When ATF is selected, the box changes to a

solid bar to allow monitoring of the aircraft’s vector versus pitch
commands.

LAN-5 D-10


Text from LAN-5_TFR_Controls_and_Displays_page_17.jpeg:
On the right side of the HUD, the radar altitude (up to 1500 feet) is
displayed on a “thermometer” type altimeter scale. A vertical bar expands
from the bottom of the scale, and the top indicates the aircraft’s radar
altitude. From 0 to 500 feet, each tick mark on the left represents 100
feet. Between 500 and 1500 feet, the scale is reduced with ticks at 750
feet, 1000 feet, 1250 feet, and 1500 feet. The caret displayed on the right
side of the scale denotes the selected set clearance. Radar altitude and
true or ground airspeeds can be displayed on the HUD and EADI only if
selected on UFC Data 1 page.

At the bottom of the HUD, two carets are positioned at the left and right
bank limit, indicating the dynamic bank angle allowed by the TF
lead-into-turn command logic.

EADI

For TF operations, the EADI uses the pitch steering bar for both manual
and auto TF (Figure D-10). When flying armed manual or unarmed
manual TF, the point of the waterline symbol (W) should be maintained
on the pitch steering bar just as you would on an ILS approach. It also
displays the “thermometer” altimeter scale on the right side.

The TF display, along with the FLIR, allows you to verify proper TF
operation and anticipate pull-up commands (Figure D-11). The “E-scope”
allows you to monitor what terrain the TF radar “sees.”

Pitch command and attitude are displayed on the top left of the scope. A
bank steering bar, an artificial horizon, and, depending on mode, a
manual TF steering box or an auto TF pitch steering bar are presented. A
circle representing the velocity vector is presented for reference to the
steering bars/box. Digital readouts of radar altitude and ground speed are
displayed below the 300 feet SC.

Flyup Enable Switch

The flyup enable switch (Figure D-3) is a two position toggle switch
located vertically on the cockpit bulkhead, just outboard of the throttles.
It is guarded with a red cover.

WARNING

The red cover guard on the flyup enable
switch can be down with the switch in
either position. Ensure that the switch is
in the proper position.

OFF Switch up. In manual TF, the automatic flyup feature is not
armed. If commanded, the flight controls will not automatically
accomplish a flyup. In the rear cockpit, there is a green
“UNARMED/NO ATF” advisory light indicating the switch is off.
This light is located on the warning/caution/advisory light panel
above the RCP MPD/MPCDs (Figure D-4).

ON Switch down. This is the normal position. In manual TF, the
automatic flyup is armed. If commanded, the flight controls
automatically accomplish the flyup.

ECCM

The ECCM mode (Figure D-4) is designed to provide maximum capability
when operating in a jamming environment. The frequency is controlled
by the system; therefore, frequency selection is removed from the display.
Jamming may be detected on the TF display as “grassy” returns, both
above and below the SC. Very powerful jamming may still result in a
flyup command. ECCM should not be used continuously in place of
NORM as a precaution against jamming but rather, should be selected
when needed and deselected when no longer needed. Circular polarization
makes the TFR less sensitive to small radar cross section (RCS) obstacles
such as towers. Also, the +5° to -20° scan pattern and 15,000 foot
command range reduces the climb peak height capability in steep terrain.

LPI

To decrease the probability of enemy detection, low probability of intercept
(LPI) mode may be used. LPI is selected by pressing the EMIS LMT
button or by boxing LPI on the TF display. LPI uses a 1-bar scan every
2.5 seconds. Between scans the antenna does not transmit and is stowed
down and to the left (Figure D-5). As a result, the turn rate is limited to
0.5°/second (approximately 10-12° of bank at normal low level speeds).
Like NORM, LPI has some auto ECCM features and can be used at the
same SCs. Unlike NORM, when in LPI, the TF radar does not
lead-into-turns. Like ECCM, frequency selection is not available. The
radar altimeter must be functional to use the LPI mode; OVERRIDE
cannot be used.

Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_12.jpeg:
Very Low Clearance (VLC)

VLC allows terrain following capability down to 100 feet. It employs a
2-bar scan pattern and scans every 0.5 seconds. Turn rate is limited to
2°/second at SCs of 200-1000 feet (approximately 40° of bank at normal
low level speeds), and is limited to 1°/second for 100 feet (approximately
20° of bank at normal low level speeds). Since VLC’s 2-bar scan spends
more time looking along the aircraft’s flight path, you may wish to employ
this mode if flying over terrain with low reflectivity, such as sand dunes,
or if the route of flight has obstacles such as radio towers. Like LPI, the
radar altimeter must be functional to use VLC.

NOTE

Terrain following should not be attempted against extended slopes or a
series of multiple obstacles along the flight path which would require a
continuous climb exceeding 20°. An extended slope is defined as upwardly

Cautions (Displays)
See Figure D-6 for locations of cautions on the various displays.

N-F LOS

The N-F LOS caution appears on the HUD if NAV FLIR video is displayed
on the HUD, and NAV FLIR line of sight is out of tolerance (more than 13
mils). Corrective action is to reboresight the NAV FLIR.

ROLL

When the aircraft bank angle exceeds 60° the ROLL caution is displayed.
Decreasing the bank angle to 60° removes the caution.

TURN RATE

When the turn rate limit of the selected mode exceeds the dynamic bank
angle indices (bank carets), the TURN RATE caution is displayed.

TURN ACCEL

The TURN ACCEL caution is activated when 2.2°/second’ acceleration is
exceeded.

DIVE ANGLE

When dive angle is equal to or greater than 15°, the DIVE ANGLE
caution is displayed. In armed manual TF, a dive angle greater than 15°
will generate a flyup after 3 seconds.

INS LIMIT

INS LIMIT appears if drift angle (10°), pitch angle (+40°, -20°), or the
outer roll angle (85°) limits have been exceeded. This is an indication that
the TF radar antenna gimbal limits have been exceeded. INS LIMIT is
also displayed momentarily following recovery from a non-TF maneuver or
during TF start-up.

LAN-6 D-8


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_15.jpeg:
AIRSPEED
AIRSPEED is displayed when flying either too slow or too fast.

e Asyour ground speed drops to 400 knots or below, AIRSPEED comes
on steady to tell you that you are outside of the TF algorithm design.

e As your ground speed drops to between 370 KCAS and 360 KCAS,
AIRSPEED flashes to show that you are below the airspeed for which
auto flyups were designed.

e The steering and HUD TF display is removed (and automatic flyup is
disenabled) if ground speed drops below 360 knots.

@ When accelerating, a flashing AIRSPEED is displayed at .97 Mach to
indicate that you are exceeding the specification limit of the TF radar
algorithm design.

The flashing caution has priority over the steady caution.

NO TERRAIN

NO TERRAIN appears when altitude, attitude, or terrain type prevents
the TF radar from receiving ground returns within a -2 G incremental
envelope (-1 G for 1000 feet SC). The NO TERRAIN caution will usually
be present in level flight above approximately 2000 feet AGL. It should go
out during the TF descent. NO TERRAIN is inhibited in the blended
mode.

ECCM

ECCM is an advisory cue displayed when the system detects a jamming
environment which may interfere with TF radar operation.

N-F BRST

The N-F BRST caution is displayed on the HUD when NAV FLIR is
selected for HUD display and the NAV pod is in boresight mode.


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_16.jpeg:
Turn Caution Windows

OBST is displayed left and/or right to alert you of terrain that would
present an obstacle to your flight path if you turned. When in auto TF
and coupled to a steering mode, turns in the direction of the OBST caution
are inhibited until the obstacle is passed. Coupled steering will resume
two seconds after the caution is removed. When an OBST turn caution
occurs opposite to the turn direction, the aircraft can maneuver in roll
between the maximum TF bank angle limit in the current turn direction
and wings level flight. During manual TF, if a turn caution is displayed
in the direction the aircraft is turning, the pilot should immediately roll
wings level.

Warnings

All TF warnings, except FLYUP, UNARMED, and NO ATF, activate an
auto flyup if in auto or armed manual TF. During unarmed manual TF,
they provide +2 G pitch steering in the HUD, ADI, and TF display. See
Figure D-6 for locations of warnings on the various displays.

FLYUP

FLYUP is displayed when a flyup is initiated (auto TF or armed manual)
or required (unarmed manual). The FLYUP caution is to alert the crew to
take control of the aircraft and complete the flyup maneuver.

UNARMED

When armed flyup protection has been requested with the flyup enable
switch or TF couple switch, the UNARMED caution is displayed because
the paddle switch is being held or the aircraft is outside the 40° pitch limit
of the flyup envelope. This leaves the system in unarmed manual TF.

NO ATF
When auto TF has been requested with the TF couple switch, the NO ATF

caution is displayed because the paddle switch is being held. This leaves
the system in unarmed manual.

LAN-6 D-10


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_17.jpeg:
TF FAIL

The TF FAIL caution is displayed when a TF system component failure is
experienced or, when in ATF, bank angle, turn rate, turn acceleration,
dive angle or pitch angle limits are exceeded.

OBSTACLE or G-LIMIT

When an obstacle is detected ahead that is within the aircraft’s flight path
and requires more than 2 incremental Gs to clear, OBSTACLE warnings
are displayed on the HUD, ADI, and TF display. The G-LIMIT warning is
displayed only for a brief instant and may not be seen by the aircrew. In
addition, the OBST warning lights in both cockpits illuminate. The voice
warning (“OBSTACLE AHEAD”) is repeated until the system determines
the object no longer constitutes a problem. If in auto or armed manual
TF, a flyup is commanded. The OBSTACLE warning occurs if terrain
returns touch the OBSTACLE warning line on the TF display. The pilot
must assist the flyup to ensure terrain clearance.

TF LOW

The NAV pod and FCC both contain low altitude monitors (LAMs) that
predict and indicate when the aircraft will descend below 75% of the SC,
based on radar altitude and vertical velocity. The TF LOW warning is
shown on the HUD, ADI, and TF display. Also, the LOW ALT warning
light is activated. No voice warning will be activated for TF LOW. If in
auto TF or armed manual TF, a flyup is commanded. If in unarmed
manual TF, the pitch command box provides pitch steering for a flyup.

TF Advisories and Associated Lights

Two lights which are directly related to TF operations are the A/P light in
both cockpits and the UNARMED/NO ATF light in the rear cockpit only.

The autopilot (A/P) status light is a green status light located just above
the utility hydraulic gauge in the front cockpit and above the right MPD
in the rear cockpit. This light illuminates when both auto TFR is coupled
and an autopilot steer mode is engaged.


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_18.jpeg:
The aft cockpit amber UNARMED/NO ATF light illuminates for any of the
conditions that cause the UNARMED and NO ATF display warnings (TF
system not armed; auto TF requested, but not controlling the aircraft;
brute force disengagements) and also if manual TF is conducted with the
flyup enable switch in OFF.

NOTE

The “BINK-BINK’” tone is activated whenever the UNARMED/NO ATF
light comes ON. The BINK-BINK tone will not sound until higher priority
voice warnings have cleared.

FLYUPS
There are two basic types of flyups: automatic and manual.

Automatic flyups, which are generated during auto TF or armed manual
TF, are 2 to 3 G incremental pull-ups commanded through the flight
control system. Automatic flyups which occur when the AFCS is fully
functional are roll compensated; the system rolls the aircraft to wings
level while pulling up to accomplish the flyup maneuver.

Manual flyups are accomplished through crew flight control inputs during
unarmed manual TF in response to TF steering commands and warning
cues.

Flyup Initiation

Flyups are generated in auto and manual modes due to violation of 75% of
set clearance (TF LOW), a detected object that requires more than 2 Gs to
clear (OBSTACLE or G-LIMIT), or a TF component failure (TF FAIL).
When the flyup is initiated, the FLYUP warning is displayed along with
the TF FAIL, OBSTACLE, or LOW ALTITUDE warning light.

LAN-6 D-12


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_19.jpeg:
Auto TF Flyups

During auto TF, flyups are also caused by exceeding the limits in
Table D-1.

Table D- 1. TF Limits.

Auto TF cockpit cues for flyups due to exceeding TF Limits are:

e AFCS initiated flyup

e TF FAIL - Voice warning and light

Auto flyups are disabled during auto TF when any of the following occur:
e Ground speed falls below 360 knots

e Drift angle exceeds 10°

e Climb angle exceeds 40°

e Bank angle exceeds 75°

Cues relating to exceeding these arming envelope parameters are:
e TF FAIL - Voice warning and light

e UNARMED/NO ATF light (RCP)

e UNARMED display warning

e “BINK-BINK’ (After higher priority aural warnings)

Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_20.jpeg:
Manual TF & Flyups - Armed

In manual TF, within the 75° bank limit, auto flyups are generated by the
same conditions as ATF (TF LOW, OBSTACLE or G-LIMIT, or TF FAIL
for component failure). In armed manual, a dive angle greater than 15°
will generate a flyup after 3 seconds.

When bank exceeds 75°, no auto flyup is available; however, a TF pitch
steering display is provided up to 85° bank angle for:

e TF LOW
e OBSTACLE or G-LIMIT

No flyup is available below 360 knots GS when drift is greater than 10° or
climb angle is greater than 40°. The cues for the aircrew are the same as
with ATF.

Manual TF & Flyups - Unarmed

Flyups are indicated through TF pitch steering commands on the relevant
displays. The crew is responsible for performing the appropriate
maneuver.

The criteria for the flyup command are the same as manual TF armed.

The UNARMED/NO ATF light is illuminated (RCP) because the TF flyup
enable switch is off (or the paddle switch is held depressed).

When transitioning to manual TF (MTF) by depressing the paddle switch,
the system reverts to unarmed MTF with no automatic flyup protection.
When transitioning to MTF as a result of exceeding pitch breakout force
or by placing the TF couple switch OFF, flyup protection is available only
if the flyup enable switch is ON.

LAN-6 D-14


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_21.jpeg:
Flyup Modes

Flyup modes are dependent on the cause or malfunction that precipitates
the maneuver. There are three modes.

Mode A - A Mode A flyup commands an incremental 2 or 3 G pull-up (auto
or manual) to an approximate 20° climb. A TF system component failure
(TF FAIL) commands an incremental 2 G Mode A flyup to 20°. Tripping
the low altitude (TF LOW), OBSTACLE or G-LIMIT warning monitors
commands a constant 3 G incremental flyup. This flyup will continue
until the monitor is no longer tripped, at which time the flyup transitions
to a Mode A flyup to a 20° climb. In armed TF, the aircraft rolls wings
level.

Mode B1 - A Mode B1 flyup is a constant and continuous incremental 2 to
3 G pull-up until a pitch attitude of +40° is reached. FLYUP is displayed
on the HUD, ADI, and TF display. The Mode B1 flyup occurs if there has
been a failure in the INS or its data transmission to the FCC. In armed
TF, the aircraft rolls wings level.

Mode B2 - A Mode B2 flyup is provided by the hydromechanical system if
the pitch CAS disengages during armed TF. The control stick is trimmed
aft to command an incremental 1 G and the PTC drives a stabilator
nose-up command which provides an incremental 2 G command and fades
to 0 G incremental in approximately 7 seconds. No roll compensation is
commanded in this flyup.

In both B1 and B2 flyups, the TF incremental G command trails off at
+40° pitch or after 7 seconds, respectively. However, since the flight
controls have been trimmed to the pitch up position the aircraft will
continue through a loop unless you take control of the aircraft and recover.


Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_22.jpeg:
NOTE

After a Mode B2 flyup, it may be necessary to retrim the aircraft within
the +0.5 G pitch trim limits before reengaging armed TF.

WARNING

The constant G Mode B1 and B2 flyup
will continue into a loop if allowed to
continue. The aircrew must make the
necessary recovery.

Flyup Bottom Line

Regardless of the flyup mode, the pilot is responsible for taking control of
the aircraft, ensuring a 20° wings level climb to MSA, and then analyzing
the problem. When FLYUP is displayed, the pitch command box or bar is
indicating a climb, or warning cues are present, climb immediately. Do
not dwell in diagnostics. Once at MSA, if the cause for the flyup is
unknown you can call up the AFCS detail BIT page to determine the
cause. The cause will be listed under “AUTOPILOT/TF STATUS” on page
one of the AFCS detail status page.

Flyup Termination (Auto and Armed Manual)
If a flyup is initiated, depressing the paddle switch terminates AFCS

inputs to the TF generated commands, reverting the system to unarmed
manual while the switch is held depressed.

TFR MODE DESCRIPTIONS
NORM

NORM (Figure D-1) is the most commonly used TFR mode. It has some
limited ECCM capability and can be used at set clearances (SCs) from
200-1000 feet. It generates climb/dive commands on terrain out to 6 nm.
NORM permits turn rates up to 5.5°/second or about 60° of bank at
normal low level speeds. The F-15E’s maximum bank angle during TF
operations, however, is 60°. The allowable bank angle is reduced to less
than 60° during left turns due to fuselage masking of the NAV pod. The
TF radar’s sensitivity in the NORM mode provides excellent detection of
obstacles with small radar reflectivity such as radio antennas and towers.
NORM should be used whenever possible, particularly when approaching
a turn point (to increase turn capability) and in rugged terrain.

Text from LAN-6_TFR_Capabilities_page_8.jpeg:
wx

The weather (WX1/WX2) modes use circular polarization to provide TF
capability while operating in the rain. The TFR climb/dive range is
reduced to 15,000 feet and the vertical scan limit is reduced to +5° to
decrease the likelihood of commanding on rain showers above the aircraft
(Figure D-2). On the TF display, synthetic video is only displayed out to
2.5 nm, reflecting the reduced command range. As a result, the WX mode
has degraded peak height capabilities when approaching very steep
terrain. Ride and frequency selections are the same as NORM. SC
selections of WX1 are 200-1000 feet. For WX2, SC selections are limited
to 500 and/or 1000 feet.

If the TF display shows returns like those on the left in Figure D-3, select
the WX1 mode for up to light to moderate rain and WX2 for heavier
precipitation and observe the returns. If they disappear from the scope,
low level flight along the planned route may be continued. However,
continue to monitor the TF display, since the moisture reflects more
energy the closer it gets, and the returns may reappear and cause an
OBSTACLE warning and a climb command.

Auto TF Disengagement

Accomplishment of any of the following actions will disengage auto TF.
e TF couple switch - OFF.
® TF power switch to STBY or OFF.

e Depress and hold the paddle switch. This action reverts TF to
unarmed manual, interrupts but does not disengage basic autopilot
and disengages any steer mode.

e Stick inputs (without depressing the paddle switch) in excess of
4.5 lbs forward or 10.6 lbs aft disengage auto TF. This action
should only be taken as an emergency procedure, due to the induced
trim errors that may result.

NOTE

ATF disengagement via exceedance of pitch stick force limits also
illuminates the MASTER CAUTION light, FLT CONTR caution light
and the MPD/MPCD AUTO PLT caution light. Once back inside TF

parameters you must paddle and release to reenter ATF. Retrimming
the aircraft may be required before reengagement of ATF.

Bottom Line

When the requirement arises to interrupt ATF to maneuver in pitch, (e.g.,
threat reaction or weapon delivery), decouple ATF if time allows; if not,

e pull aft on the control stick and climb to MSA or above. (Do not
depress and hold the paddle switch until at or above MSA.)

® remain above MSA until manual/auto TF reestablished.
e accomplish the maneuver.
e release the paddle switch upon reestablishing TF.

e reengage steer mode with the A/P button as required.

LAN-7 D-6


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_13.jpeg:
Recovery from maneuvering requires stabilization within TF limits for 1-3
seconds in NORM, WX and ECCM modes, and 0.5-1.0 seconds in VLC and
LPI. It is unnecessary to interrupt ATF to maneuver in roll within TF
limits. Control stick steering will allow you to change the aircraft heading
by interrupting the engaged steer mode while leaving the autopilot
altitude hold engaged. However, operating outside of TF roll limits for
greater than 2 seconds will result in a Mode A flyup. Anytime the paddle
switch is held depressed, flyup protection is disabled.

Blended Mode

Blended mode involves the coupling of ATF to the altitude hold mode of
the autopilot and allows the aircraft to fly a higher BARO/RDR altitude
and still maintain TF protection. Blended mode maintains the current
BARO or radar altitude until the TF system determines that positive
incremental Gs are required to maintain the selected TF set clearance.
Once the terrain has been cleared using ATF, the aircraft recaptures the
desired BARO or radar altitude (Figure D-3). In blended mode, the bank
angle caret limits look the same as they do in auto/manual TF (45° left
and 60° right in normal mode). However, the autopilot roll limit will only
allow +41.5° bank in the NAV steer mode and +30° bank in the TCN steer
mode. Blended mode is engaged from either the altitude hold mode of the
autopilot or from ATF.

While in autopilot altitude hold, engage blended mode by placing the TF
switch to ON and the TF couple switch to COUPLE within 4 seconds. If
the TF COUPLE switch is NOT set to COUPLE within 4 seconds, MTF
occurs and the autopilot altitude hold function is disengaged. You can
also enter blended mode by selecting TF COUPLE first then turning the
TF radar switch to ON. If all conditions for initiating ATF are satisfied,
blended mode becomes active.

To engage blended mode from ATF use the UFC A/P submenu. While
holding the paddle switch depressed, press ALT TF (PB #8) on the A/P
submenu. Then fly the aircraft to the desired altitude and release the
paddle switch. Blended mode is engaged at the BARO or radar altitude
established when the paddle switch is released. The A/P TF designation
then changes to A/P BATF or A/P RATF (Figure D-4).

Blended Mode Display Changes

If the altitude hold A/P is in control of blended mode, the ATF pitch bar is
dashed and the NO TERRAIN caution is inhibited on the HUD and EADI.
When the ATF is in control (ATF maintaining terrain clearance), the ATF
pitchbar is solid and the NO TERRAIN caution is active. The green A/P
indicator light illuminates in each cockpit when blended mode is engaged.
PB #9 on the UFC Menu 1 and the top line of the A/P submenu display
either BATF (barometric altitude) as the altitude source or RATF (radar
altitude) as the altitude source (Figure D-4).

Soft ride is always commanded in blended mode because TF performance
is better in the transition from ATF to altitude hold. If selected before or
during blended mode, hard ride will not be implemented until exit from
blended mode.

Blended Mode Disengagement

There are four options for disengaging blended mode.

e Paddle switch depress. This removes the altitude hold and steer
mode engaged portion and puts the aircraft in unarmed manual TF.
When the paddle switch is released, the aircraft reverts to ATF. If
PB #8 on the A/P submenu is reselected before the paddle switch is
released, the blended mode reengages at the new altitude where the
paddle switch is released.

e A/P submenu PB #3. Pressing (deselecting) PB #3 results in exiting
blended mode and returning to ATF. Toggling PB #4 between RDR
and BARO changes the altitude source, but does not, of itself,
disengage blended mode.

e TF couple OFF. This disengages both altitude hold and steer mode,
and results in MTF.

e TF radar switch STBY or OFF. This disengages all TF and A/P
modes. The pilot must fly the aircraft.

Expanded Blended Mode

The blended altitude/TF mode has been expanded to allow engagement of
the altitude select autopilot mode capability. Performance is the same as
blended mode, with the addition of a smooth transition from one altitude
to another by entering the new altitude into the altitude select on the A/P
submenu. Altitudes between 1000 feet and 50,000 feet can be selected.
You must be between 360 knots ground speed and .97 mach. When the
newly selected altitude is achieved, the aircraft will transition to the
blended mode.

Mode Engagement from Blended Mode

The expanded mode is most easily entered from blended mode. While in
blended mode select the autopilot submenu on the UFC. Type the desired
altitude into the scratchpad and enter it by pressing PB #8 (Figure D-5).
This action initiates the mode and the aircraft starts the appropriate
climb or descent.

To engage the expanded blended mode, the aircrew must first engage the
TF capability. Move the TF couple switch to the COUPLE position and
move the TF RDR switch from STBY to ON. During the 4 second

Mode Failures and Indications

Prior to the Suite 3 change, the aircrew had no indication of why an
autopilot/TF event occurred. Since causes for these events include both
system failures (not directly under pilot control) and limit exceedances
(initiated by pilot action), knowing the cause allows the pilot to take the
appropriate corrective action.

Both the cause and/or existing functional failure are displayed on the
STATUS page under AFCS DETAIL under BIT. When weight is off
wheels, DETAIL defaults to the STATUS page (Figure D-8) with
maintenance faults available by selecting FAULTS at PB #13. With

OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Mission Planning

TF operations suggest that a surreptitious entry and exit from an area is
desired. Therefore, be well acquainted with the terrain you will fly over.
Plan your route to provide terrain masking and avoid high ridge crossings
and man-made objects like power lines and towers. Recognize the
potential no-show areas such as sand dunes, snow covered peaks, dry
lakes and bodies of water. Plan the use of clearance plane settings
commensurate with the threat and the terrain.

Weather may degrade NAV FLIR resolution and require WX1 or WX2
mode for continued TF flight. Remember peak height restrictions for the
WX and ECCM modes. If you are heavy, you may consider routing
through less rugged terrain and avoid deep valleys and steep ridges. Keep
minimum speeds in mind. Have a solid route abort plan for each segment
of your TF flight. Determine appropriate MSA for combat and training.
Recognize reduced bank angles due to fuselage masking. Know who to
talk to and what to squawk if you exit a route. Review the Dash 34-1-1 for
additional mission planning considerations.

Ground Operations

You must thoroughly check all LANTIRN components and associated
systems prior to takeoff.

After the TFR and NAV FLIR have timed in (TF STBY and N/F STBY on
UFC Menu 1), run an AIU (or auto) BIT, then run the LANT/RALT BIT.
Running the BIT before both systems have timed in (or with one system
OFF) may produce false failure indications. After the BIT, have the crew
chief check the NAV pod BIT indicators to see if any components have
failed, and if so, start another BIT and call for a “redball.” If a specialist
asks you to cycle the power on the pod, turn both the TFR and NAV FLIR
to OFF and allow one minute in OFF before returning to STBY.

This prevents a power surge, which may trip circuit breakers in both the
aircraft and pod. The TFR will require an additional 3 minutes to time in.

Before takeoff, check the BIT page for any faults in the TF RDR, NAV

FLIR, AFCS, RALT (radar altimeter), AIU, INS, ADC and MPDP. Each
of these systems plays an important role in TF operations.

LAN-7 D-16


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_23.jpeg:
Airborne Operations

Prior to TF operations, perform a confidence check of the TFR system [AW
the Dash 1 and Dash 34-1-1. Before low level operations, accomplish as
many cockpit administrative tasks as possible. Changing radio
frequencies, A/A 'TACAN, selecting displays or arranging your kneeboard
paperwork are a few tasks not appropriate during a TF descent.

Both crew members should pay special attention to verifying that their
standby attitude indicators are properly set. Periodically cross-check the
standby attitude indicator throughout the flight so that if an MPDP fails
during night TFR operations, the standby instruments can be used during
the flyup.

TFR Requirements

AFI 11-2F-15E, Volume 3 and 4FW Supplement, Chapter 8 lists TFR
requirements as follows:

e > 400 KCAS in mountainous terrain

e Night — avoid let-downs into rugged terrain

e TFR not authorized until confidence check is complete
e If any part of the confidence check or any component fails,
abort or fly at MSA/RAA

e Operating outside TF limits below MSA is not authorized
e Pilots — no heads down sensor operations outside TF limits

e TF malfunctions — climb to MSA/RAA, clear malfunctions
and then continue


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_24.jpeg:
e Minimum equipment:

TF radar

E-scope

INS

CARA/radar altimeter

Maximum of one failed display per cockpit

HUD and MPCD required in FCP

No unarmed manual TF

Select EADI and verify STBY ADI accuracy before loft

TF Descent

The initial descent is normally accomplished to 1000 feet SC. Both crew
members should monitor the TF display during the descent. Some rules of
thumb for a let-down from medium altitude to 1000 feet SC, over level
terrain include:

@® max commanded dive is 12°.

e TF video at 1 nm mark passing 2600 feet AGL (12° dive, 480 GS)
(2000' + %2 dive angle x 100’).

e = pullout/level off begins not later than 1600 feet AGL
(12° dive, 480 GS) (1000' + 2 dive angle x 100’).

e descend over level terrain if possible and cross-check MSL altitudes
against radar altitudes.

In some cases, the TF let-down is accomplished from a VFR departure at
lower altitudes (i.e., 4500 feet AGL). In this case, a full dive does not
occur, but the crew should verify that the pullout occurs when video
returns reach the ZCL. In either case, planned recovery initiation altitude
(RIA) should be established to allow for a wings level recovery at MSA
should TF protection be lost during the descent.

Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_33.jpeg:
Low Level Navigation

The TSD provides a great deal of situational awareness for TFR. It
provides a cross-check of aircraft position versus courseline, permits
anticipation of turns and helps in selecting a route of flight that optimizes
terrain masking. Look for valleys and ridgelines on the TSD and compare
them to what appears through the NAV FLIR and on the E-scope. The
TSD should have a 45° bank angle and 480 knots set for the course line
reference.

Occasionally exceeding TF limits is inevitable, but the crew should take
immediate action to correct the situation. Usually this means reducing
the bank angle. For an OBST caution in the direction of turn, roll wings
level until the OBST caution is removed, then resume the turn.

Operating Limitations
The following are Dash 1, Chapter 5 limitations.

e Minimum SC for manual TF in mountainous terrain in IMC is 500
feet. Mountainous terrain is defined as a vertical change which
equates to a 15% slope change.

e Terrain following is prohibited with a degraded INS attitude
platform or TF attitude fail or after performing an in-flight
alignment.

e Airspeed should be maintained above 370 KCAS and 400 knots GS
to avoid TF algorithm inaccuracies. TF operations above 0.96 mach
(650 knots GS) are prohibited. LANTIRN operations above 0.9
mach may cause overheating of both pods. A NAV POD HOT or
TGT POD HOT caution may indicate that the pod is being flown
outside its environmental limitations.

e Refer to Aircraft Operating Envelope With Single (Both) LANTIRN
Pod(s) Installed for airspeed limits with one or both pods installed.


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_34.jpeg:
CREW COORDINATION

Good crew coordination is essential during all phases of flight, but it is
particularly critical for night TFR. The techniques discussed here are
merely a foundation. Every crew member must develop his own habit
patterns and cover them in the crew briefing. Know what to expect from
the other crew member before stepping to the aircraft.

Pilot

The pilot’s primary responsibility is flying the aircraft. In manual TFR,
this means keeping the velocity vector in or above the TF steering box and
staying within bank limits. All other tasks are secondary, especially at
night when visual cues are limited.

The pilot usually has responsibility for navigation, using the TSD and
NAV FLIR to select the best route of flight for terrain masking. However,
if the WSO needs to make an HRM map the pilot may need to fly a
particular path through the hills, so cross talk is essential.

During auto TF, the pilot task loading is significantly changed and he can
shift some attention to other tasks. Threat analysis, E-scope
interpretation and assisting the WSO are options in auto TF that were not
available during manual TF, but the pilot is still responsible for “flying”
the aircraft, using ATF to reduce workload.

WSO

The WSO’s primary responsibility is sensor operation (A/G radar, A/A
radar, TGT IR). Whenever possible, the WSO should perform cockpit
duties such as radio changes, IFF/AAI changes and other UFC operations.
This reduces task loading on the pilot and permits the pilot to concentrate
on the primary task. The WSO also backs up the pilot by monitoring the
TF E-scope and the HUD repeater. During some phases of flight, the
WSO may wish to use RBM to provide an additional sensor for terrain
avoidance (for example, in areas of reduced FLIR visibility or approaching
a coastline with rapidly rising terrain) or to locate weather cells for
avoidance.

LAN-7 D - 28


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_35.jpeg:
Pilot and WSO

Either crew member can make changes to TF mode, SC or ride selection;
however, always coordinate with the other crew member before changing
something that will affect the aircraft’s flight path. Sometimes changing
one system affects another. For example, when descending to a lower SC,
it is important to reset the LAWS to avoid an unwanted LOW ALTITUDE
warning.

Some failures demand your attention. For instance, TF FAIL and FLYUP
may accompany a BIT failure. Both crew members should make certain
the aircraft is level and at a safe altitude before initiating any BITs. If an
AV BIT caution light occurs during TF flight, a crew member (usually the
WSO) should select a BIT display to see if the failure involves a LANTIRN
component or associated system.

During the attack phase of the mission, both crew members face an
increase in task loading. The WSO is often busy with radar work, and
during the delivery, the pilot may be required to devote more attention to
acquiring the target in the NAV FLIR. To avoid task saturation, a good
understanding of each other’s duties is vital. Prior to a maneuvering
attack, such as a loft, each crew member should select an ADI display,
verify standby ADI operation and confirm that the other crew member has
done so as well. At least one crew member (again, usually the WSO)
should monitor a TF display during the attack and recovery maneuver.
Verbally confirm such parameters as pull-down altitude, release altitude,
MSA and egress heading.

The LANTIRN system provides the F-15E with a tremendous increase in
versatility, but it places high demands on the crew. Only by developing
effective crew coordination techniques can the system’s full capability be
realized.

MANUAL, AUTO AND BLENDED TF OPERATIONS
Manual TF

Manual TF operations require the pilot, through flight control input, to
maintain the desired terrain clearance by keeping the velocity vector in
the TF “box.” Further, the pilot is responsible to stay within the TF limits
covered in previous lessons. Small deviations during manual TF
operation are to be expected, but constant attention must be dedicated to
following climb and dive commands and remaining within TF limits.

Armed Manual

The pilot maintains terrain clearance and the aircraft within TF limits by
following the TF “box” climb and dive commands. Auto flyup protection is
provided in that should any flyup commands occur due to component
failure or obstacles in your flight path, the command is sent directly to the
flight controls and the flyup is accomplished without pilot input.

Unarmed Manual

Unarmed manual is the same as armed manual, but auto flyup protection
is not provided and the pilot must accomplish any commanded flyup. The
use of unarmed manual TF has been largely restricted by Higher

Headquarters. The use of either TF mode in IMC conditions is prohibited.

Manual with Radar Altimeter in Override

Manual pilot inputs are required to maintain TF limits and terrain
clearance. If the tactical situation dictates TF with a failed or jammed
radar altimeter, placing the radar altimeter in override will allow manual
TF operation. The radar altimeter will be off and safety features and
warnings provided by the FCC low altitude monitors are removed. There
is no peacetime situation to warrant flying manual TF with the radar
altimeter in override.


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_8.jpeg:
LAN-7

WARNING

If MTF is conducted with the radar
altimeter switch in OVERRIDE, all TF
low altitude flyup and low altitude
warning functions are inoperative. The
TF flyup enable switch must be placed in
the OFF position; otherwise, a TF FAIL
condition will exist and the crew will
experience continual flyups. Over
rolling/rough terrain it is possible to cross
ridges significantly lower than the SC.

CAUTION

If the radar altimeter switch is in
OVERRIDE, the LAW function must be
turned off (UFC Menu 1) to avoid
activation of the low altitude voice
warning and warning light.


Text from LAN-7_TFR_Operations_page_9.jpeg:
Auto TF

Placing the TF couple switch to COUPLE initiates auto TF operations.
This coupling of the TF system to AFCS and the autopilot enables the
crew to terrain follow and navigate almost “hands off.”

e When initially coupling TF with no steer mode previously engaged,
only the “basic” autopilot attitude hold is engaged to the TF radar.

e If you have greater than 7° bank, the system will maintain
the bank angle at engagement until a steer mode is engaged
or the aircrew makes manual steering inputs.

e If you have less than 7° bank, the system will maintain
wings level at engagement until a steer mode is engaged or
the aircrew makes manual steering inputs.

° A steer mode may be engaged after coupling by either
selecting it via PB #3 on the autopilot submenu on the UFC
or by depressing the A/P button on the UFC.

NOTE

In auto TF rolling outside of TF limits for greater than 2 seconds will
result in a flyup. You must return to within TF limits, then paddle
and release to discontinue the flyup and reenter auto TF.

If bank angle is between the bank angle carets and 60° (turn
rate caution) you will get an auto FLYUP and TF FAIL until

returning to within limits and paddle and release.

If bank angle is between 60 and 75 degrees (roll caution) you

will get an auto FLYUP and TF FAIL until returning to within
limits and paddle and release.

If bank angle is between 75 and 85 degrees you will get a
“bink-bink” tone, TF FAIL, MASTER CAUTION light,
UNARMED/NO ATF light and an AUTOPILOT caution on the
MPD/MPCD the associated FLYUP commands displayed on the
HUD/MPD/MPCDs must be manually accomplished until you
return to within limits and paddle and release. At more than 75
degrees of bank you are outside of the auto flyup envelope.

AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_10.jpeg:
Formation

The pilot maintains aircraft position/control and visual lookout (route and
tactical formations).

The WSO maintains visual lookout, operates/monitors radar, changes
UFC data, operates the navigation systems, and monitors the formation
position. (At low altitude—300 ft and below—the WSO is primary for
formation.)

Instruments

The pilot confirms that an EADI and other appropriate instruments are
displayed prior to entering IFR conditions or beginning instrument flight.
Then, the pilot flies the appropriate route, fix-to-fix, holding pattern, or
approach.

The WSO monitors and advises on critical positions/attitudes and/or
altitudes. The WSO monitors the present position, heading, altitude, and
can “bug” GCA assigned headings using CMD HDG on the HSI and set
the desired course. The WSO also changes radio frequencies, navigation
aids, and HSI steer modes unless briefed otherwise.

Air-to-Air Employment

The WSO is normally the primary air-to-air radar operator until the sort.
The crew may want to change this based on crew experience, proficiency,
and the anticipated specifics of the mission (especially with Suite 3). The
assigned primary radar operator takes command of the radar, conducts
search and sort, and locks on to the target. Normally, whoever has control
of the radar also talks on the radio.

If the pilot is not the primary radar operator, he flies the aircraft as
required or directed. If the pilot is running the radar, he advises the WSO
of their actions.

Both the pilot and WSO should ensure the EID criteria are met using
AAI/EID/NCTR as applicable. The WSO ensures the weapons
employment checklist is completed and monitors weapons status on the
PACS.

OPS-1 D-4


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_11.jpeg:
As a general rule, no later than 10 nm (or at a briefed/predetermined
time), the pilot takes command of the radar (to ensure auto acquisition
capabilities at the merge), flies to the weapons employment position, and
employs the weapons. With the transfer of the radar to the pilot, the
WSO takes over the visual lookout responsibilities. The pilot owns the
radios at radar handoff and should inform the wingman/lead of any
changes due to target maneuvering.

Air-to-Surface Employment

Low Level

The pilot flies the low level using all available means to maintain
situational awareness on the route of flight and terrain clearance (i.e.,
visual references, HUD, TSD, TEWS, TFR, and/or NAV FLIR
presentations). When directed by the WSO, the pilot flies a mapping leg
to attain the desired squint angle for A/G radar employment.

The WSO generally performs all of the head-in-the-cockpit functions. The
WSO operates the radar, monitors TEWS and the TF scope, and backs up
HUD steering with TSD/HSI. The WSO also monitors INS/MN accuracy
with A/G radar, performs updates as required, and is responsible for route
timing. The WSO will direct a mapping leg if required.

FLIR Operations

With the LANTIRN NAV pod, the pilot turns on the NAV FLIR and
advises the WSO when he is using snap look or look-into-turn. The pilot
also confirms manual/auto TFR, advises the WSO of any changes to
clearance planes/TF modes, and confirms that the aircraft is within TFR
limits after a dive or climb when auto is reengaged.

The WSO monitors the HUD display and TFR scope (E-scope), and
changes the LAWS when requested by the pilot or dictated by mission
requirements.

With the LANTIRN targeting IR pod, the WSO turns on, boresights, and
operates the targeting IR pod in all normal circumstances. The WSO cues
it with the A/A radar, A/G radar, or TSD, updates, lases as appropriate,
and deselects the laser. The pilot confirms that the laser has been
deselected by referencing the HUD and confirming verbally.

OPS-1


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_12.jpeg:
IP to Target

The pilot should remain in the A/A master mode until the target area is
clear of all air threats, and then go to A/G master mode. For timing, the
pilot can reference the command velocity wiper in the HUD or the ETA on
the DATA 2 page for timing to the IP or target.

Once in the A/G master mode, the pilot follows attack steering while
monitoring the target area and TEWS for possible A/G or A/A threats.

The pilot is responsible for turning on the master arm IAW the tactical
situation or local area range restrictions. The pilot executes the planned
delivery and egresses the area (or enters range pattern). The WSO selects
PACS, and confirms the program selected and that weapons are ready.
The WSO prepares for target acquisition using TSD, A/G radar, and
targeting IR.

The WSO designates the target using the best means available (TGT
POD, HRM, RBM, NAV, etc.). The WSO confirms that A/G master mode
is selected, good steering is available, and master arm is on and RDY
lights are present; and then monitors the delivery parameters.

Threat Reactions

The crew must clearly distribute threat reaction tasks to effectively
employ the F-15E in a high threat environment. Many aircrews divide
this objective into an offensive and defensive partnership, giving the pilot
primary responsibility for the offensive portion, since the pilot “owns” the
visual arena. The pilot is alternately responsible for defense.

In this case, the WSO’s primary responsibility is defense, since so much of
his time is spent “checking six.” The WSO also provides backup for
offense.

The use and coordination of the countermeasures (CMD) chaff/flares must

also be coordinated to ensure they are being employed when needed and
that both aircrew members are not dispensing them at the same time.

OPS-1 D-6


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_13.jpeg:
Crew Coordination During Emergency Procedures

Good crew coordination during any aircraft emergency is imperative. It
can be the difference between the successful recovery of a crippled aircraft
or a Class A mishap with two fatalities. As always, good crew
coordination starts with a thorough crew brief. Crew coordination briefing
guides are available in the flying squadron flight briefing guides, but may
need to be tailored to accommodate aircrew experience and personal
techniques. The three basic steps to any emergency procedure still apply:

1. Maintain aircraft control
2. Analyze the situation and take the proper action
3. Land as soon as practicable

At a minimum, you need to cover your plans of action for:

AMAD/engine fire during start
Engine fire on takeoff

Blown tire on takeoff

Aborted takeoff
Ejection/command selector valve
Brake failure

Ground egress

Bird strikes/structural damage
Barrier engagement

It is the responsibility of BOTH aircrew members to ensure the safe
operation and successful recovery of their aircraft. The following
information outlines general aircrew considerations.

Pilot

The pilot-in-command must always maintain aircraft control during any
abnormal situation. There are currently no “boldface” procedures
associated with the F-15E because there are very few emergencies that
require immediate action. The pilot and the WSO must quickly “analyze
the situation and then take the appropriate actions. The WSO refers to
the checklist and backs the pilot up in assessing the problem. Once the
problem has been correctly assessed, the appropriate checklist actions
should be accomplished with the WSO backing up actions taken by the
pilot (i.e., effective crew coordination). In time critical emergencies, such
as a high speed abort, the pilot is responsible for accomplishing the first
few steps of the emergency procedure. The pilot must also keep the WSO
advised of the steps already taken to control the situation and then the
WSO will follow up with the appropriate checklist.

D-7 OPS-1


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_14.jpeg:
WSO

The task of the WSO during an abnormal situation is to refer to the
checklist to ensure the appropriate steps are being taken. The WSO reads
all appropriate checklists (both emergency and normal checklists) when
time and conditions permit. In short, the WSO feeds the pilot the
information needed to safely recover the aircraft. In some instances, the
WSO may accomplish some of the checklist items like lowering the hook or
pulling the emergency brake/steer handle after coordinating with the
pilot. In many cases, the WSO is also the one who informs others of the
situation.

Responsibilities of Both

It is the responsibility of both the pilot and WSO to maintain situational
awareness (SA). In addition to aircraft status, crew members must know
the distance to and status of their primary landing base. They must know
when, where, and how to jettison ordnance/stores from their aircraft. And
most importantly, they must know when to “jettison” the aircraft. Though
the pilot-in-command is ultimately responsible for this decision, as a crew
they must discuss and agree to the decision to eject, unless there is not
enough time for crew coordination.

DISPLAY PROGRAMMING AND SETUP

The final setup in each cockpit still depends on crew preference. A great
deal of coordination is necessary to effectively program and set up F-15E
displays. Here are possible display alignments for each cockpit.

Pilot
LMPD MPCD RMPD
A/A RDR TSD TEWS/HSI
A/G RDR ARMT TGT IR
TF RDR HSI BIT/ADI

(An ADI is not programmed because it always comes up on the FCP
MPCD with first activation of the FCP castle switch.) LMPD/RMPD could
be considered mission critical displays.

WSO
LMPCD LMPD RMPD RMPCD
TF RDR HUD A/ARDR TEWS
TSD TGT IR A/GRDR_ HSI
ARMT BIT TGT IR ADI

The WSO should have engine instruments displayed for takeoff selected
via menu. LMPD/RMPD could be considered mission critical displays.

Master Modes

Since desired presentations can be programmed to automatically come up
when A/A, A/G, or NAV master mode is selected (INST master mode is a
preset standard and cannot be programmed), the following is a possible
master mode alignment that may be used subject to unit/crew preference.

SITUATIONAL AWARENESS (SA)

If one has all of these qualities and can perform all of these tasks, that
individual has SA.

e Building a 3D picture in your mind of the entire situation.

e Assimilation of information from multiple sources (visual, auditory,
kinesthetic, balance).

e Knowing spatial position and geometric relationships of yourself and
the things in the environment around you.

e = Periodically updating the current situation (this is normally done
through communication).

e Prioritizing information and actions (what to attend to at the
cognitive level and what to do at the subconscious level).

e Making quality and timely decisions.

e Projecting the current situation into the future (anticipating,
predicting, and basing actions on upcoming events).

SA usually falls into the four categories listed below:

Both crew members have total SA - best.

One crew member has good SA - good.

Neither has SA - bad.

Neither has SA but one thinks he does - worse.

The key to keeping SA on the positive side of the scale is effective crew
coordination. Effective crew coordination starts with intercockpit
communication which must be clear, concise, and necessary. Unnecessary
chitchat in the cockpit is a distraction to the task at hand, and is a key
contribution to the loss of SA.

What Is A Loss Of SA?

A loss of SA occurs when cockpit distractions and/or responsibilities cause
a breakdown in the prioritization of information, resulting in a temporary
failure to properly assess available information and initiate required
aircrew actions. This can lead to disaster.

A breakdown of SA normally occurs in at least one of four areas:
distraction, inattention, channelized attention, or complacency.
Awareness describes one’s ability to acquire and maintain situational
awareness. It demands attention and implies a grasp of the overall
situation, an ability to stay on top of things, or an ability to control the
situation. In the air-to-air arena of fighter aviation, this may mean
keeping track of different groups of bandits at different locations in front

D-15

OPS-1


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_22.jpeg:
of and behind you. One must listen to auditory inputs from intercockpit,
interflight from the wingman, AWACS, and different warning tones from
the radars of the bandits locking onto your aircraft, or warning messages
from the voice warning system in the aircraft. Fighter pilots must be able
to compartmentalize to a certain degree, to prioritize tasks, to use
judgment and to decide which perceptual input to deal with right now,
whether visual, auditory, balance, or kinesthetic. Humans can do but one
thing at a time consciously, but can shift very rapidly between inputs or
use habitual behavior to the point where they can accomplish several
tasks apparently at once. Pilots must always remain oriented with the
environment around them, so if the perception of imbalance or vertigo
occurs, the cross-checking of the instruments becomes the main priority.
Inattention to the instruments at this point or channelized attention on
some other task during this critical phase of flight has killed many an
aviator. The records of the National Transportation Safety Board show
that each year roughly 80 percent of aircraft accidents are caused by pilot
error.

How Do I Recognize It?

Staying focused on the task at hand, staying ahead of the aircraft, and
being mentally prepared to fly is the only way to maintain situational
awareness in a changing environment. Occasionally a distracter such as
an aircraft malfunction occurs and your attention and awareness is not
focused on the task at hand. A visual distraction could be a light bulb
burned out, an auditory distraction could be from somebody else in the
aircraft or on the radio, a kinesthetic distraction may be a nose gear
shimmy. All of these alone are no big deal, but they could cause you to
channelize your attention on that distraction. Webster defines
complacency as smug self-satisfaction. To allow ourselves to become smug
and overconfident in our abilities is to invite disaster. Performing
repetitious tasks successfully can lead to complacency. This may give one
the false sense that the job is simplistic or consists of menial tasks without
inherent dangers. Aircrew kill themselves quite often because they forget
the task at hand while thinking about something else. That may or may
not be due to complacency but is certainly due to the failure to consciously
monitor the present task cognitively. When one is flying an aircraft at
500 feet and 500 knots, how can they not stay focused or be thinking of
something else? One must pay attention to the appropriate task, at the
correct time, and at the needed level of consciousness to maintain total
situational awareness.

OPS-1 D-16


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_23.jpeg:
Symptoms

Aircrew need to know their own limitations and how much they can
depend on the attentive capabilities of others. Personalities differ in each
person regarding directions, strength, and scope of attention. It is
important for the individual and those involved in their selection,
training, and employment to measure and recognize these differences.
The most important is a person’s attentiveness to tasks. Some people can
attend to more information than others. Normally, information from only
one sense at a time reaches the level of consciousness, with the other
inputs being censored at the midbrain level. Again, humans can do but
one thing at a time consciously but can shift very rapidly between inputs
or use habitual behavior to the point that they can accomplish several
tasks apparently at once. This is why we say the way to get more SA is to
practice the event often. Repetition of any stimulus reduces the threshold
for attending and thus allows a response to the repeated signal quicker at
the subconscious level.

Some pilots could not describe what they do with the throttles and stick
during most maneuvers. Once one learns a task or a job, much of it is
performed by habit that is not necessarily subject to conscious control or
memory. A familiar process is initiated consciously but continued and
completed by habit, using a different portion of the brain. This frees up
the conscious or cognitive portion of the brain so that one’s attention can
be directed to another task as the previous task is completed by habitual
behavior. Habitual behavior depends upon identical repetition of
circumstances and fails when the situation is not identical. Even if the
ground is level and regular, aircrew can fly into it simply because they did
not know they were losing altitude during a turn. Entering a turn at low
altitude requires that pilots attend exclusively to ground clearance tasks
so they can judge whether they are converging with the ground along the
intended flight path.

Attention is our ability to do more than one task at the same time. We
regard the human as a limited-capacity channel who can only transmit a
small amount of information per second. Whenever this small amount is
exceeded, people make errors. An aircrew member who must process
information that exceeds their individual channel capacity will make
mistakes. There are not many possibilities for increasing the channel
capacity of aircrew, although extensive training may sometimes give the
impression that this happened.

OPS-1


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_24.jpeg:
The most important portion of situational awareness is to attend to things
at a conscious level and then rapidly shift to a subconscious level, so that
another task may be accomplished at the conscious level. One can only
pay attention to one task or process at a time while they are using
habitual attention on the other tasks. Most pilots can hold the aircraft
attitude, altitude, and airspeed constant with rapid shifting while they
actively listen or talk on the radios. If there is a demand for attention to
the aircraft attitude, then the attention for the radio communication will
be broken. When rapid shifting is required, one is susceptible to fatigue
which normally leads to channelized attention, task misprioritization, or
inattention to the required tasks at hand causing a loss of SA.

How To Get More SA

SA skills can be increased easily. By increasing knowledge of tactics and
weapons capabilities, one can stay on top of the tactical situation easier.
The SA skills can be developed and improved by increased flight time in a
realistic multibogey, high threat environment. This is definitely due to
building habit patterns and behaviors so that more tasks can be
accomplished at the subconscious level. When actual training cannot be
done, simulation is the next best thing and networked simulation, as a
supplement to flight time, enables practice scenarios that, for practical
reasons, cannot be done in the air short of war.

If we cannot increase a person’s SA skills, perhaps we can teach the key
indicators to lost or poor SA. The following are the key indicators.

e Reduced frequency and degraded quality of communication
(inside/outside of the aircraft).

e Reduced maneuvering of aircraft or difficulty in aircraft control.

Begins to react defensively rather than offensively.

Channelized attention—becomes fixated on some activity (slow

cross-check).

No reaction to wingman or GCI communication.

Poor premerge kill ratio.

Failure to maintain awareness of mission objectives.

Violations.

Omitting checklist items.

OPS-1 D-18


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_25.jpeg:
Solutions

Some solutions for situational awareness are nothing more than common
sense items. Perhaps above all, if you get into a corner, recognize it,
admit it, and handle it.

Be prepared to fly.

Plan the mission thoroughly.
Brief thoroughly.

Outline clear delineation of duties.
If you have a problem, admit it.

e Handle the problem.

Treat it as an emergency.
Climb to cope if at low level.
Set new priorities.

Tell someone.

Pass control of the aircraft, or engage autopilot, if appropriate.
RTB/abort.

The bottom line is work on more inattention; yes, pay less attention.
Sounds strange doesn’t it? To increase your SA, one must try to increase
their habitual behaviors and to accomplish more tasks at the subconscious
level. Train like you are going to fight and when the time comes, you will
react instinctively, out of habit.

EJECTION SYSTEMS AND THE DECISION TO EJECT
Seat Capabilities

The F-15E is equipped with the ACES II ejection seat. This seat has true
zero-zero capabilities for virtually all boarding weights. The seat system
allows for selection of various single and dual sequenced ejections, based
on the position of the command selector valve and which seat initiated the
ejection. The ejection seats are equipped with a primary and secondary
ejection system along with a canopy breaker system (Figure D-1). These
systems are isolated and independent of each other. Both the primary
and secondary ejection systems are initiated when the ejection control
handles in either cockpit are raised. When the ejection control handles
are raised there is a built-in time delay that will allow the primary system
to operate without having the secondary system interfere with its
operation. If the primary system does not operate within .4 seconds, the
secondary system will fire, jettisoning the canopy and firing the seat
catapults. If both systems fail to jettison the canopy the secondary system
will fire the seat catapults, resulting in through-the-canopy ejection. The
secondary system will fire the seats regardless of canopy position.

The seat restraint system holds the crew member in the seat during the
ejection sequence. Prior to man-seat separation the restraint release
system fires, releasing the lap belts, inertial reel straps, and the seat pan
release. The survival kit seat straps should be positioned so they are snug
but not so tight as to restrict movement.

CAUTION

If the survival kit seat straps are left
loose there is the possibility that
during man-seat separation injury or
entanglement may occur.

an ejection, the seat operates in one of three modes also described in
TO 1F-15E-1.

Mode 1

Mode 1 is the slow speed mode (Figure D-3). With the aircraft below
15,000 ft MSL and 250 knots or less (Figure D-5, page D-26) there is a 0.2
second delay between the ejection and the time the main parachute
drogue is deployed. At 0.45 seconds, man-seat separation and parachute
inflation begins. At 1.8 seconds there will be full inflation of the RCP
parachute. The front seat will have full parachute inflation 0.4 seconds
after the RCP due to the delay in a dual sequenced ejection.

Mode 2

Mode 2 is entered when you eject in the region bounded in Figure D-5,
page D-26 by airspeed and altitude. It can be considered your high
airspeed, low altitude ejection mode. In this mode, the seat will fire and
deploy the seat mounted drogue (Figure D-4). The seat mounted drogue is
used to stabilize and slow the seat down, decreasing the possibility of
flailing injuries. This mode will be maintained until the seat decelerates
into the Mode 1 region, at which time the seat drogue chute is released
and the main parachute is deployed. There is a slight increase in the time
it takes to get a fully inflated parachute over a Mode 1 ejection.

NOTE

When comparing the times contained in Figure D-4, the back seat would

add approximately 0.3 seconds for canopy separation and the front seat
should add an additional 0.4 seconds for a dual sequenced ejection.

Mode 3 is the high altitude mode of the ACES II ejection seat

(Figure D-5). During a high altitude ejection the possibility exists that
you may fall face down in the seat depending on altitude when the seat
drogue chute deploys until entering the Mode 1 region of operation. When
you enter Mode 1 your seat functions, deploying the parachute and
initiating man-seat separation.

NOTE
This may be the one time you try to beat the seat. If you pull the

emergency manual chute handle it releases the seat drogue chute and
initiates main parachute deployment and man-seat separation.

WARNING

Pulling the emergency manual chute in
the upper airspeed regions of a Mode 2
or Mode 8 ejection may result in
flailing injuries.

Making the Decision

The ejection decision has to be made in a timely manner to avoid an
out-of-the-envelope ejection. There have been several ejections in the
Strike Eagle. Most have been successful with the crew initiating the
ejection within the envelope. However, there is a least one case where a
very experienced crew failed to initiate an ejection within the envelope
from an aircraft that was in a spin, resulting in two fatalities.

The rules still apply; use 2000 ft AGL for controlled and 6000 ft AGL for
uncontrolled ejection. Once the decision has been made to eject, both crew
members should initiate the ejection sequence by pulling their own control
handles.

GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

The F-15E crew coordination requirements are unique and require a mind
set different from any other two-place fighter to fully realize the F-15E’s
state-of-the-art capabilities. Due to its unique cockpit avionics, either
cockpit offers the capability to control most of the aircraft avionics or
sensors thus creating the possibility for confusion in the cockpit during
mission performance. It is therefore imperative to inform the other crew
member when action in one cockpit affects the other cockpit; for example,
when taking command of a display or changing a HSI steer mode. A more
critical example is when the WSO changes the SCP on the TFR without
informing the pilot. This affects the safe operation of the aircraft, not just
the use of a display.

In broad terms, the pilot is responsible for aircrew briefings, aircraft
preflight, aircraft control, weapons deliveries, assigning specific mission
duties, aircraft recovery, aircraft postflight, and aircrew debriefings.

The WSO is responsible for applicable specific mission briefings, weapons
preflight, the input and check of mission data on the UFC, specific duties
as assigned during the aircrew briefing, monitoring aircraft status and
mission progression, target designations, aircraft systems management,
and changing radios and navigation aids, unless briefed otherwise.
Further guidance can be found in MCR 55-115 and local directives.

CREW COORDINATION

Certain systems lend themselves logically to a primary user by virtue of
their function and/or location. Others are not so clear cut and in many
cases full operation can be accomplished from either cockpit. This
discussion identifies the more critical areas and suggests controller/
operator and backup duties.

These duties are not restrictive and should be modified as experience is
gained in the F-15E. Also bear in mind that suggested duties are subject
to modification depending on crew member experience level in certain
missions, unit standardization, and the environment.

OPS-1


Text from OPS-1_Task_Management-Crew_Coordination_page_8.jpeg:
Pilot Duties

The pilot’s primary duty as aircraft commander is to maintain aircraft
control, make critical decisions, and take the appropriate actions to ensure
mission success and aircraft safety. The pilot is responsible for effectively
flying the aircraft to the correct position as required by the particular
mission or tasking. Another pilot responsibility that may be different
from other crew aircraft is navigation to and from the target/mission area.

WSO Duties

The WSO’s primary duty is weapon systems management and operation,
and to act as a “safety observer” to ensure mission success and aircraft
safety. The WSO backs up all basic responsibilities for navigation and is
in charge of operating the INS and inserting/changing data on the UFC to
include the radios, sequence points, navigation aids, and IFF/SIF codes.

Duties of Both
Checklist

The pilot and WSO are responsible for checklist completion for the aircraft
during all phases of ground operations or flight. The “challenge and
response” technique is an excellent way to ensure all required checklist
items are completed during normal or emergency operations. The WSO
should initiate the appropriate checklist, confirm the action with the pilot,
and then ensure the action is completed correctly.

Advisement

Communication of actions or intended actions between cockpits is an
absolute necessity for effective employment of the F-15E. Many tasks
in both cockpits are very time critical and taking command of a display or
changing a master mode at the wrong time can greater affect the outcome
of a mission and cause confusion in both cockpits. Excellent examples of
this are when the pilot takes command of the radar just as the WSO is
trying to designate the target or changes of set clearance planes during
TFR operations without advising the WSO. In either case, the actions
may cause distractions and detract from what the aircrew is trying to
accomplish. Effective communication will solve this problem if both
aircrew advise each other of any deviation from briefed duties and
acknowledge any actions or deviations.

AOA Warning Tones

A 900 Hz double tone (two short 10Hz beeps followed by a .3 second pause) is
available to cue the aircrew when a programmed angle of attack limit is
exceeded. In addition to the warning tone, the AOA units displayed in the
HUD will flash when this limit is exceeded. The system limit defaults to

30 units at power up with CFTs, external air-to-ground stores, or
miscellaneous stores loaded on the aircraft. The system can be programmed
for 20 to 50 units through the HUD repeater format. Enter the desired value
(20-50 units) in the UFC scratchpad and then depress PB #15 on the HUD
repeater to enter the value. Setting 46 to 50 units disables the AOA warning
tone. The gear down AOA tone is a high pitch (1600 Hz) beeping tone, which
starts at 28.4 units. The beep rate increases as AOA increases. The tone can
be eliminated by decreasing AOA.

Coefficient of Lift (C,) Versus AOA

The generalized C, versus AOA curve for a high speed, swept wing aircraft
(Figure D-2) illustrates the way C,, varies with changing AOA.

C, MAX = MAXIMUM LIFT COEFFICIENT
As = STALL AOA OPS-02-02

Figure D - 2. C, Versus AOA.

OPS-2 D-4


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_11.jpeg:
Lift coefficient increases as AOA increases to some maximum value of C,, at
which point any further increase in AOA results in decreased lift. As the
figure shows, this happens in the negative AOA direction also.

The AOA associated with C,, MAX is the classic “stall” AOA (alpha). An
aircraft can be limited to some AOA less than alpha due to control authority
limits or a handling qualities limit.

In any event, whatever limits the maximum usable AOA or C, ends up
determining the definition for stall in that aircraft. The stall itself may be
spectacular or a nonevent, but it is always a limit to performance. In the
F-15E, classic stall AOA is never achieved due to the aft stick stabilator limit
being reached before actual C, MAX.

Coefficient of Lift (C,) Versus Coefficient of Drag (Cp)

In studying the effect of AOA on performance, it is necessary to look at how
drag is related to lift production. It is referred to by several names, but
regardless of what it is called, the relationship of drag to lift is the root of
aircraft performance.

D-5 OPS-2


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_12.jpeg:
A typical curve showing this lift versus drag relationship is shown in

Figure D-3. Unless the aircraft under study is a glider, the L/D relationships
must be related to engine performance in order to determine optimum
performance.

This data is presented in 1F-15E-1-1 Performance Data. These work for
preflight planning purposes; but for in-flight situations, charts are not
practical and rules of thumb that produce near optimum performance are of
much greater value.

AOA Rules of Thumb

Best cruise and best loiter (endurance) is a concern at one time or another
during any flying career (e.g., first the crew is told to divert, and at the divert
base, is told to hold). The crew needs simple solutions to generate near
optimum performance.

In the F-15E, 14 units AOA at or below 25,000 feet or 14.5 units AOA above
25,000 feet establishes optimum cruise. This should give max range for the
present altitude; and, if the aircraft goes to the optimum altitude for the
configuration (probably near the tropopause), this should provide the overall
max range.

For max endurance, 18 units AOA at or below 25,000 feet or 17 units AOA
above 25,000 feet works well. Maximum endurance is not altitude sensitive.
Climbing to optimum holding altitude does reduce fuel flow, but it takes more
than an hour to save the extra fuel used to climb.

In a fighter aircraft, turn performance is also a major concern. Of interest
are the maximum turn and the optimum turn. The max turn for any set of
conditions is easy for the F-15E because it is obtained at full aft stick, or the
G limit, whichever comes first. Be careful though, because in many
configurations, there is a 30-unit AOA limit. The max turn can normally be
sustained only for a few seconds before you must ease off the stick to stay
below 30 units. Airspeed will bleed off at a high rate when performing a max
turn.

The optimum turn refers to the maximum turn rate that can be maintained
without losing energy. Generally, an optimum energy-conserving turn
requires about 16-22 units AOA.

So now you have some AOAs to put in your bag of tricks. To obtain generic,
near optimum performance inside the envelope, fly:

8-10 units for best acceleration

14/14.5 units for max range cruise (25,000 feet or > 25,000 feet)

18/17 units for max endurance (25,000 feet or > 25,000 feet)

16-22 units for optimum, energy-sustaining turns

28-30 units for best rate

AOA)

Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_14.jpeg:
NORMAL FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS

Normal flight characteristics deal with the subjects of stability, control and
maneuverability. Of interest are: how easily you are able to change an
aircraft’s flight path (maneuverability), how much effort you must expend to
keep the aircraft’s nose pointed forward (controllability) and how the aircraft
responds to small disturbances (stability).

These three areas are tied together and are usually not constant throughout
the flight envelope. As a matter of fact, in high-speed aircraft that carry
expendable stores, large changes in stability and control can occur in flight.

Terms and Relationships

Stability deals with the reaction of systems disturbed from equilibrium. It is
described as being positive, negative or neutral. Positive indicates a tendency
to return to equilibrium once disturbed. Negative indicates a tendency to
move away from equilibrium. Neutral implies no tendency to regain or move
away from equilibrium. Figure D-4 illustrates this concept.

POSITIVE A NEGATIVE B NEUTRAL C

OPS-02-04

Figure D - 4. Static Stability Hlustration.

Static stability refers to the initial tendency to return to equilibrium, and
dynamic stability refers to the tendency to finally settle back at the original
condition. Dynamic stability can also be positive, negative or neutral.
Another look at Figure D-4 reveals that only the system with positive static
stability has any chance of being dynamically stable.

OPS-2 D-8


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_15.jpeg:
Maneuverability deals with how easy it is to intentionally alter the
equilibrium condition. It can be viewed as being opposed to stability.

Controllability deals with the ease with which equilibrium can be
maintained.

As stability is increased, maneuverability decreases and it becomes difficult
to change the aircraft’s flight path. On the other hand, as stability is
decreased, maneuverability increases, but the flight path becomes more
difficult to control. Stability can be decreased to a point where controlling the
aircraft becomes a full time job; and finally, in aircraft such as the F-16,
control is impossible with a manual flight control system.

A fighter should be as maneuverable as possible, but not require a pilot’s full
effort to control it. This puts limits on stability. When stability is reduced to
enhance maneuverability, there are ways to provide apparent stability.
Variable gain flight controls and stability augmenters can make an aircraft
seem more stable to the pilot than it really is.

The F-15E uses variable gain controls. Pitch and roll channel response is
modified to compensate for changing aerodynamic conditions. The F-15E also
employs a control augmentation system (CAS) in pitch, roll and yaw. The
CAS complements manual control inputs and provides damping.

These systems together provide the controllability of a fairly stable aircraft.
At the same time, maneuverability is very good and similar to that available
in a marginally stable aircraft.

AOA and Mach Effects

As mentioned earlier, stability of an aircraft is not constant throughout its
flight envelope. Variations in AOA and Mach number change the stability of
an aircraft. The effects of these variations on the F-15E are discussed below.

D-9 OPS-2


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_16.jpeg:
AOA Effects

As long as AOA remains in the linear portion of the C, versus AOA curve,
aircraft stability is not affected by changes in AOA. However, when AOA
goes well beyond this straight line area, airflow patterns over the airframe
change significantly. Flow separation occurs from some areas, and flow
blanking occurs in other areas.

Flow separation results in the center of pressure moving forward, reducing
stability. The result is a tendency for nose rise or pitch up. Less stabilator
input is required to raise the nose. Flow blanking, on the other hand, affects
the vertical tails. Reducing flow over the tails reduces their contribution to
directional stability.

The net result of the changes at high AOA is an overall reduction of stability
and controllability at a time when control becomes critical. The changes can

make operating at very high AOA dangerous.

Mach Effects

Airflow characteristics vary with Mach number; in general, supersonic flow
becomes incompressible. In the transonic region, as the airflow pattern
changes from one of primarily subsonic flow to supersonic flow, there is a
large center of pressure change (from approximately .25 to .560 MAC (mean
aerodynamic cord)). This change generates a large nose down pitching
moment, which is known as Mach tuck.

As airspeed changes from supersonic to subsonic, the center of pressure
moves forward, which generates a large nose up pitching moment, known as
transonic dig-in. These characteristics may cause control difficulties when
operating near Mach 1.

In addition to changes in longitudinal (pitch) stability, directional (yaw)
stability changes with Mach number. In general, directional stability
increases through Mach 1 and then begins to decrease. The sweep back of
the wing adds to directional stability in the transonic region, but its effects
are overcome at higher Mach numbers (sweep back needs to increase). At
high Mach numbers lift decreases and the vertical tail surfaces lose
effectiveness at generating side loads to offset side slip, leading to reduced
directional stability.

OPS-2 D-10


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_17.jpeg:
F-15E Flight Controls

Since Mach and AOA effects tend to change aircraft response to pilot inputs,
and changing response may lead to overcontrol, the F-15E flight control
system was designed to compensate. The automatic flight control system
(AFCS) modifies aircraft response so as to mask the changes in stability
caused by AOA and Mach effects. Hence, nose rise, pitch-up, stick force
lightening, Mach tuck and transonic dig-in do not show themselves in a
normally functioning Eagle. The phenomena are present, but are not
apparent to the pilot.

This means the pilot can maneuver aggressively throughout the envelope
with little fear of overcontrol. Remember, though, the destabilizing
phenomena are real and must be dealt with by the pilot if the AFCS is not
doing its job.

Landing Configuration

The landing configuration alters an aircraft’s basic stability for several
reasons. Gear struts and doors alter airflow patterns and create pitching
forces. Raising and lowering gear changes the aircraft CG. Moving flaps
changes wing shape and effective lift. All of these changes combine to reduce
longitudinal and directional stability and/or limit stabilator authority.

The F-15E flight control system compensates, in part, for the landing
configuration. However, since full aileron and differential stab response to
lateral stick is available at any longitudinal stick position when the landing
gear is down, significant adverse yaw may exist at high AOA. An AOA limit
of 30 units has been established to prevent departure in the landing
configuration. The 1600 Hz AOA tone will sound at 28.4 units AOA in the
landing configuration to help prevent departures.

ADVERSE HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS

This section looks at some configurations and conditions encountered which
affect the F-15Es handling characteristics.

External Stores

Adding external stores to an aircraft does three things: changes airflow and
air loads, changes the center of gravity and adds weight. Since these three
factors influence handling characteristics, it is safe to say adding external
stores to an aircraft changes its handling characteristics. Just how and to
what magnitude handling characteristics change is another story. Among
other things, stores affect more than one axis.

OPS-2 D-12


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_19.jpeg:
Symmetrically Loaded Stores

Aerodynamic Effects: External stores are aerodynamically unstable in
themselves, and they tend to aerodynamically destabilize an aircraft in one or
more axes. Fuselage stores reduce lateral/directional stability, while wing
stores reduce longitudinal stability.

CG Effects: Loading stores change the aircraft CG. The CG movement may
be in any or all three axes. Longitudinal changes affect pitch stability.
Lateral changes affect lateral/directional stability and departure/spin
susceptibility. Vertical changes are usually not terribly significant.
Longitudinal changes are usually of most interest and are, in fact, the only
ones routinely computed for the crew by the wing quality assurance function.
As CG moves forward, the aircraft becomes more stable. As CG moves aft,
the aircraft becomes less stable in pitch. The same statement generally
applies to directional stability as well. Figure D-5 illustrates the effects of
external stores on overall aircraft stability.

Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_20.jpeg:
Inertial Effects: Stores add mass to the aircraft (for some, the mass is quite
large). This mass equates to added inertia; thus, it is harder to get the
aircraft to move and harder to get it to stop once motion is established. Since
the mass distribution is changed along with the total mass, inertial response
and inertial coupling are also changed in all three axes. On the plus side, the
added mass tends to dampen short term disturbances, providing a more solid
feeling aircraft.

Total Effect: The total effect of loading external stores on the F-15E is a
combination of all the individual effects. The F-15E flight control system
compensates for much of the change caused by loading stores, but not all.
The aircraft is somewhat more sluggish due to inertial effects. The aircraft is
more susceptible to departure at high AOA due to store instability. Ifa
departure occurs, it is more violent than in the clean aircraft. Also, recovery
from out-of-control situations normally takes longer.

Asymmetrically Loaded Stores

The aerodynamic, CG and inertial effects of asymmetrically loaded stores are
the same as for symmetrically loaded stores. However, rolling and yaw
moments are created due to the unbalanced loads. Once again, the flight
control system can, up to a point, compensate for these moments. At high
AOA, the flight control inputs needed to counter the asymmetry can be more
than the system can provide and may greatly increase departure and spin
susceptibility. Should a departure or spin occur, recovery time is significantly
increased.

The aircraft is fully controllable below 30 units AOA with lateral asymmetry
equivalent to one full external wing tank. Above 30 units AOA, lateral
asymmetry is the most significant factor contributing to departure
susceptibility.

OPS-2 D-14


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_21.jpeg:
Dash 1 restrictions are designed to keep lateral asymmetry under 5000 ft-lbs,
thereby keeping the aircraft resistant to departures and spins. Lateral
asymmetry over 5000 ft-lbs significantly increases susceptibility to
departures/spins. Extreme susceptibility occurs at 7000 ft-lbs.

Single Engine Operation

Due to the way the engines are mounted, the high thrust output of the
engines, and flight control mechanization, single engine operation does not
produce significant yaw/sideslip if conditions permit operating below MIL
power on the good engine. If afterburner is required (e.g., high gross weight
and/or high air temperature), sideslip becomes quite noticeable (especially
with -229 engines).

F-15Es equipped with -229 engines may experience a departure characterized
by rapid uncommanded sideslip, should an asymmetric thrust condition be
encountered at high speeds and power setting. The Asymmetric Thrust
Departure Prevention System (ATDPS) is designed to provide protection
against such an occurrence.

During normal cruise and recovery operations, there are no special control
problems associated with single engine operation. The most significant
handling problem is flight control transients, which degrade aircraft handling
characteristics caused by cycling hydraulic switchover valves. To prevent
switchover valve cycling, avoid stabilized flight where engine windmilling
conditions produce hydraulic pressure fluctuations between 800 and 2000 psi.
In addition, at high gross weights the ability to climb or accelerate is severely
degraded.

No Flap Landing

The no-flap landing configuration presents no particular handling problem.
The aircraft is slightly more pitch sensitive than with the flaps down, and
total drag is reduced. The pitch attitude for a given AOA is noticeably higher
than with the flaps down. These combine to make a precise spot landing
slightly more difficult.

Turbulence
At lower gross weight and wing loadings, the F-15E exhibits a bumpy ride in

turbulent air. This should not cause significant flight path variation, but
may be uncomfortable.

ADVERSE FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS

Even though the F-15E flight control system alleviates many of the more
undesirable characteristics of a swept wing fighter, the characteristics are
there and can cause grief under certain conditions. Adverse yaw, stalls,
departures, coupling, autorolls, spins and inadvertent nose high/nose low
situations can all occur and need some discussion.

Adverse Yaw

Sideslip produced by roll control deflection is known as adverse yaw. Effects
of this sideslip can vary from barely noticeable to spectacular. Adverse yaw
varies with AOA and is strongest at high AOA.

Cause - Deflection of ailerons effectively changes a wing’s shape, AOA and lift
vector orientation. These changes affect drag as well as lift and produce
yawing moments.

Cues/Recognition - Sideslip created by adverse yaw displaces the ball of the
turn and slip indicator, if displayed. The crew members may also feel
themselves being pushed laterally in the cockpit. Reduced roll rates, roll
hesitation or roll reversal may occur at higher AOA.

Prevention/Recovery - The solution to adverse yaw is to use rudder to
coordinate all turns and “keep the ball centered.” Fortunately, the F-15E
flight control system does this for you. The mechanical flight control system
washes out aileron deflection at high AOA (with the gear up) to reduce
adverse yaw, and the ARI blends in rudder to overcome any sideslip
produced. If operating with a degraded AFCS, (roll CAS OFF, or pitch or roll
ratio EMERG), use manual rudder to coordinate turns. Limiting AOA also
reduces adverse yaw. With the gear down, ailerons are not washed out and
adverse yaw is more pronounced.

Stalls

In the purest sense, stall occurs after C,, MAX is exceeded. Beyond

C,, MAX, further increases in AOA reduce C,; however, available stabilator
authority does not permit reaching actual C,, MAX in the F-15E. In practice,
there are several definitions for stall, but all are based on some maximum
useful lift coefficient.

OPS-2 D-18


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_25.jpeg:
One G Stall

This stall occurs when the extreme of useful C,, is achieved in unaccelerated
flight. In the F-15E, the wing is not fully stalled in this situation.

Cause - Maximum AOA at full aft stick is achieved. C, MAX for the aircraft
is not achieved, but AOA cannot be increased using the stick. There is not
enough thrust to overcome the drag in this situation, so the aircraft goes
downhill.

Cues / Recognition - This stall has no spectacular cues. In a 1 G stall, the
stick is against the aft stop; the AOA is stabilized at 38 units or above. Light
buffet begins at approximately 15 units AOA, increases in intensity until

23 units and then remains fairly constant. Buffet begins earlier and is
somewhat more intense with external stores aboard. Small roll/yaw
oscillations are present. The aircraft is sinking; roll/yaw response is almost
nonexistent.

Prevention / Recovery - If in a 1 G stall, neutralize lateral control inputs and
ease the stick forward to reduce AOA. Add power, if available, to speed up

the recovery.

Accelerated Stall

In this stall, once again, the wing does not exceed its maximum lift potential.
However, airframe buffet is heavy and moderate yaw and roll oscillations
occur. Drag is high and the energy state and flying characteristics quickly
approach the 1 G condition.

Cause - High AOA induces flow separation, and the turbulent air impinging
on parts of the airframe causes buffet.

Cues / Recognition - The key indicators for this stall are the heavy airframe
buffet and moderate roll/yaw oscillations. There is also a very rapid energy
bleed off rate. Buffet and yaw/roll oscillations diminish with airspeed
reduction. Turn rate essentially goes to zero.

Prevention / Recovery - Prevention is just a matter of awareness and smooth

control inputs. Recovery is accomplished by releasing back pressure until the
buffet eases.

D-19 OPS-2


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_26.jpeg:
Negative G Stall

This stall is similar to the positive G case, but with negative AOA.
Cause - Maximum negative AOA at full forward stick is attained.

Cues / Recognition - AOA is pegged at zero with the stick against the forward
stop. Since 0 is the minimum indication on the AOA gauge, AOA is pegged
long before the stick reaches the forward stop. Your body is pushed towards
the canopy, you have tears in your eyes and you can taste your last meal.

Prevention / Recovery - Most people have a natural tendency to avoid this
condition, and judicious use of forward stick prevents a stall. If “in the

straps,” positive aft stick is required to generate a positive AOA.

Landing Configuration Stall

This is essentially the same case as the one G stall. However, since full
aileron travel is available at any fore or aft stick position, care must be taken
to avoid adverse yaw caused by aileron input. With external stores, buffet
onset is at a lower AOA and buffet level increases.

Out of Control/Departure
Before discussing the causes, recognition and recovery techniques for out of
control and departure situations, the distinction between the two must be

clearly understood.

Out of Control

The aircraft is out of control if it is not properly responding to flight control
inputs.

Departure

A departure is characterized by an uncommanded change in the aircraft’s
flight path such as a nose slice, roll away from lateral input or excessive yaw
rate. In the F-15E, a departure is normally accompanied by the yaw rate
warning tone. The yaw rate warning tone should be treated as an indication
of the need for immediate initiation of the out of control recovery and not as
an indication of max performance.

OPS-2 D - 20


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_27.jpeg:
Cause - Yawing moments are present that exceed the aircraft and flight
control system capabilities to restore stability.

There are several potential causes of departure in the F-15E. These include
asymmetric thrust, flying with lateral asymmetries or inappropriate
maneuvering at low AOA.

Asymmetric Thrust Departure Prevention

Asymmetric thrust is a potential problem only for F-15Es configured with
PW F100-229 engines. In the event of an ATDPS failure above 500 KCAS or
1.1 Mach, the aircraft is subject to departure. Likewise, intentional
asymmetric throttle inputs in this flight regime can also lead to departure.

To prevent departures due to asymmetric thrust, do not make asymmetric
throttle inputs above 500 KCAS/1.1 Mach. In the event of an ATDPS failure,
remain below this speed regime. For those flying Strike Eagles configured
with PW F-100-220 engines, the problems will not be encountered throughout
the flight envelope.

Lateral Asymmetry Departure Prevention

While it may be intuitively obvious that an asymmetrically loaded F-15E
would be more susceptible to departure, Strike Eagle crews may find
themselves going to combat with just such a configuration. Mission tasking,
multiple targets, and mixed loads may occasionally result in asymmetric
aircraft configurations.

Nevertheless, application of Dash 1 procedures should prevent these
departures. Limit maneuvering to below 30 AOA when asymmetrically
configured, and avoid inappropriate low AOA control inputs. Keeping the
AOA below 30 units under these circumstances is easy to do.

Inappropriate Control Inputs at Low AOA

The most likely cause of F-15E departures is the misapplication of flight
control inputs at low angles of attack (below 30 AOA). As with the F-15A-D,
the Strike Eagle is subject to low AOA departures resulting from improper
stick and rudder inputs. The Dash 1 emphasizes the fact that the aircraft is
capable of generating very high pitch and roll rates at low AOA. Inertial and
kinematic coupling during high pitch and roll rates can lead to both high yaw
rates and large AOA and sideslip angle excursions. Laterally asymmetric
loads, centerline fuel tank and LANTIRN pods can aggravate such
excursions. If these factors alone are not sufficient to make Strike Eagle

D-21 OPS-2


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_28.jpeg:
drivers take notice, higher airspeeds can aggravate the situation even
further.

According to the Dash 1, “low AOA maneuvers, which are particularly
departure prone, include abrupt lateral stick or full rudder pedal inputs
below 25 CPU or abrupt or full cross-control inputs below 30 CPU. At any
AOA, abrupt longitudinal stick inputs should be avoided while the aircraft is
already rolling rapidly.” Furthermore, rolling or slicing departures may be
encountered even in level flight if attempting “...high sideslip maneuvers with
extensive cross-control inputs (lateral stick opposite rudder) ...and such
departures are more likely to be encountered with external fuel tanks and/or
LANTIRN pods installed.”

So, how do Strike Eagle drivers prevent such departures? There is an easy
answer-follow the Dash 1 guidance. When maneuvering the aircraft at lower
AOA (below 30 CPU), abrupt lateral stick/full rudder inputs and abrupt
cross-control inputs are not effective means of flying the Strike Eagle, and
these inputs can easily lead to low AOA departures.

Coupled Motion

Coupled motion is defined as motion in one axis caused by motion in another
axis. For example, rolling with rudder is coupled motion; a yaw or directional
input causes a sideslip that, in turn, causes the aircraft to roll. Pulling the
stick aft and establishing a pullup is an example of noncoupled motion. The
term roll coupling is often heard because rolling motions readily couple with
the yaw and pitch axes of modern fighter aircraft.

Cause - The actual cause of coupling in a given circumstance may not be
readily apparent to the pilot and there may be more than one cause. The
coupling mechanism may be aerodynamic, kinematic or inertial.

Cues/Recognition - Unfortunately, coupling is usually only recognizable after
the fact: accelerations were higher than anticipated, G or AOA got away from
the pilot or the aircraft departed. In modern aircraft, including the F-15E,
coupling as a result of rolling (roll coupling) is a concern; so when
uncommanded sideslip or AOA starts to build during a roll, coupling is
usually the case.

OPS-2 D - 22


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_29.jpeg:
Prevention/Recovery - You cannot totally avoid coupling, nor should you want
to. A rudder roll is an example of controlled coupling. However, unbridled
coupling can lead to loss of control and even aircraft disintegration. If roll
velocities are controlled in terms of rate and duration, coupling generally does
not cause a real problem. However, avoid large, abrupt control inputs in two
axes at once.

Also avoid trying to generate a very high roll rate when large AOA or yaw
rates already exist. If you detect coupling before it reaches catastrophic
proportions, smoothly neutralize the controls and allow the natural stability
to recover the aircraft.

As a general rule, if a roll is started using the rudders, stop it by using the
rudders. This helps prevent inadvertent coupling, autorolls and spins.

Autorolls

An autoroll is a sustained roll/yaw motion occurring after control
neutralization, and is viewed in the cockpit primarily as roll. The wing is not
stalled during an autoroll.

Cause - An autoroll is an example of coupled motion. A large sideslip angle
created by the pilot with rudder at high AOA starts the aircraft rolling
because of aerodynamic coupling. The stick is then moved forward, which
drives up the roll rate. The roll rate builds so fast that inertial coupling
prevents AOA and yaw/sideslip angles from being reduced. Hence the
autoroll continues, sustained by any residual rudder that may be present.
Without residual rudder, the roll eventually stops, if the aircraft CG is not
abnormally far forward.

Cues/Recognition - An autoroll can be recognized by roll acceleration as the
stick is moved forward during a rudder roll. The AOA stays at 20-30 units.
Yaw rate may or may not be high enough to actuate the departure tone.
Airspeed is normally between 200 and 350 knots.

Prevention/Recovery - The autoroll can be prevented by judicious use of
rudder at very high AOA, and by using smooth stick movements during any
rudder maneuvering. If an autoroll is encountered, neutralize the controls
and smoothly feed in opposite rudder to stop the roll. When the roll rate
decreases, the AOA breaks and the nose pitches down. The severity of the
negative G pitch-over is a function of the rate of recovery and is worse if pitch
CAS is off. An abrupt application of rudder may cause a negative G pitch-
over of up to four negative Gs. If in a negative G autoroll, neutral controls
will recover the aircraft.

Spins

The F-15E is extremely resistant to departure at high angles of attack (above
30 cpu). Even so, flight control malfunctions at high AOA or large lateral
asymmetries make it possible to depart and spin the jet. A spin is a sustained
roll/yaw motion, which is viewed, in the cockpit, primarily as yaw. The wing
is stalled during a spin. The spin is probably the premier example of coupled
motion.

Cause - Progression from a departure to a spin is most likely if neutralization
of controls is delayed, lateral stick is held against the roll/yaw and/or lateral
asymmetry is present. Most, but not all spins exceed the 60°/second yaw
rate, with AOA pegged (over 45 units) and extremely low airspeed. Also, the
turn needle will be steady and fully deflected in the direction of the spin.

If engines are left in afterburner during a spin, they are more likely to
stagnate than during normal flight. Reduce power to military if in
afterburner.

Cues/Recognition/Recovery Characteristics - If the AOA is pegged and the
departure tone is on, the aircraft may be in, or about to enter, a spin. If the
yaw rate is more or less constant at 60-135°/second (45°/second inverted), and
if you are being pushed forward in the seat, the aircraft almost certainly is in
a spin.

The flight control system has a Direct Electric Link (DEL) between the FCC
and the stab actuators that is active during the normal CAS-off period in spin
conditions. In the DEL mode, the FCC essentially controls the stab actuators
with full, no-feedback authority in harmony with the lateral stick command if
the aircrew moves the control stick in the same direction as indicated by the
Spin Recovery Display (SRD). There is no DEL command in the pro-spin
direction. The warning in the Dash 1 to reset the pitch and roll CAS is to
ensure the DEL mode has engaged. The CAS will probably remain
disengaged.

OPS-2 D - 24


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_31.jpeg:
To aid in spin recognition and recovery, the aircraft provides the aircrew with
a SRD. The system recognizes a spin condition when yaw rate exceeds
57°/second, or exceeds 41.5°/second and persists above 30°/second for greater
than 5 seconds. At that time, all MPD/MPCD displays are replaced by the
SRD (Figure D-6).

Spin types include:

Oscillatory Spin

e Average yaw rate: 60-90°/second
e Average AOA: 70-80 units (pegged)
e Typical oscillations: 20°/second yaw rate

To quickly recover and prevent a flat spin from developing, use aileron in the
direction of spin (turn needle). The flight control spin recovery mode assists
in spin recovery by allowing full aileron authority, regardless of longitudinal
stick position (if yaw rate exceeds 41.5° per second for five seconds). Neutral
controls alone normally recover the aircraft, but more slowly (2500-7000 feet
altitude loss), and may allow progression to a flat spin. Delaying recovery or
inadvertently applying pro-spin (opposite) controls can rapidly cause a flat
spin.

Flat Spin

@ Average yaw rate: 75-135°/second

@ Average AOA: 70-90 units (pegged)

@ Extreme (negative 3-4 G) “eyeballs out” forces - uncomfortable and
disorienting

@ Very little oscillation

To recover, use full aileron in the direction of rotation (turn needle). The yaw
rate reduction is smooth and quite slow, so it may not be apparent for some
time. To recover requires a minimum altitude loss of 3000-6000 feet, two to
four turns, and 10-20 seconds; however, there are documented recovery cases
with numbers well beyond these.

Neutral controls alone do not recover the aircraft. Pro-spin controls

accelerate yaw and delay recovery or cause the crew to initiate ejection
procedures (documented several times).

OPS-2 D - 26


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_33.jpeg:
Low Yaw Rate Spin

@ Encountered infrequently, most likely from a slowspeed entry

Mild oscillations

@ You may not get a SRD until more than 5 seconds at >30 degrees per
second yaw rate

@ Low yaw rate: approximately 45-60°/second (departure tone beep rate may
not be constant)

Full lateral stick in the direction of the spin normally recovers the aircraft
quickly. If the aircraft is in the low rate spin mode and is not recovering with
full anti-spin controls (especially with yaw rate gyro failure), landing gear
may be lowered to ensure full anti-spin aileron deflection. If for some reason
DEL has not engaged, do NOT extend flaps!

Delay in applying recovery controls (or applying pro-spin controls) can cause
a higher spin rate.

Inverted Spin

@ Normally entered from negative G stall (full lateral stick or rudder applied
at full forward stick)

@ Average yaw rate is low: 40-45°/second

@ Average AOA: minus 55-60 units (pegged off the low end)

@ No buffet or oscillations

Neutral controls recover aircraft in 1 to 1-1/2 turns, with approximately
4000 feet altitude loss.

If a very high rotation rate has developed before you begin recovery, it takes
quite a while before the yaw rate stops (10-20 seconds). If carrying a lot of
stores or an asymmetric load, the recovery takes even longer. Altitude
required to recover from a spin is difficult to predict. Typically, altitude loss
is 1500-2500 feet per turn and 1 to 7 turns are required to break the spin.
Remember that a dive recovery follows the spin recovery and 6000 feet is the
minimum execution altitude for ejection.

Inadvertent Nose High/Low Airspeed

This is not a serious condition in the F-15E unless the aircraft is close to the
ground.

Cause/Recognition - This condition is normally the result of inattention
during extreme vertical maneuvering. Lack of aircraft response to control
inputs is the first clue.

Prevention/Recovery - If, despite your best efforts, the aircraft ends up nose
high at very low airspeed, neutralize the controls, retard the engines out of
AB and wait for the aircraft to recover. The aircraft ends up pointed down
and airspeed increases. The ride may be somewhat uncomfortable as the
aircraft flips around, but the F-15E stabilizes fairly quickly if the pilot does
not fight it.

The aircraft unloads as speed approaches zero and one or more of the
following may happen:

@ Aircraft falls off forward, backward or to the side.

e@ CAS falls off the line due to yaw rate (master caution/flight control).
@ Oil pressure falls to zero during the unload (master caution/ engine).
@ ECS surges and Display Flow Low caution illuminates.

As the nose falls, the aircraft may roll (quickly) or nose may tuck. Maintain

neutral controls, not forward stick. Once nose is down and airspeed is
increasing, recover from the dive.

HANDLING QUALITIES WITH MALFUNCTIONS

You should now have some knowledge of handling characteristics and
phenomena as they apply to aircraft in general and the F-15E in particular.
You should also know how the F-15Es flight control system works and its
normal response throughout the flight envelope. You should spend some time
thinking about how failure of certain components of the AFCS affects
handling characteristics. The Dash 1 describes handling with various
portions of the mechanical flight control system and CAS inoperative. You
should read these descriptions in Section HI and VI of the Dash 1 if you have
not already done so.

The best way to relate aircraft handling characteristics to flight control
malfunctions is to recall the purpose of the various flight control features.

NOTE

If a flight control anomaly is apparent, but aircraft control is adequate,
do not disengage CAS since it may be responsible for maintaining

controlled flight.

CAS Off

With the CAS off (all axes) and pitch/roll ratios in AUTO, the aircraft feels
less solid. Stability augmentation and precise handling refinements are lost.

@ The aircraft is sensitive at high speed, and pilot-induced oscillations (PIO)
may occur. Because of this, operation with CAS off above 600 KCAS is
prohibited.

@ Higher stick forces are required at high G.

@ There is no added authority to compensate for external stores. Close
formation/AAR may be difficult with three external tanks.

@ Automatic trim is less effective.

@ CAS ARI is inoperative. Some manual rudder may be needed for
coordinated flight.

@ Aircraft may exhibit some wallowing and dutch roll tendencies.

D-31 OPS-2


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_38.jpeg:
Pitch/Roll Ratio EMERG

With the pitch and roll ratios in EMERG and the CAS on, the
hydromechanical system uses fixed midrange values, and the CAS must use
more of its available authority to give nearly normal handling characteristics.

@ There is no mechanical ARI.
@ Maximum stabilator deflection is reduced at low speed.
@ The greatest potential problem is if pitch CAS fails or is turned off.

CAS Off, Pitch Ratio EMERG

In this case, the pitch ratio goes to fixed midrange authority (.3 to .5). No
additional authority is available from CAS.

e@ Aircraft handling is significantly degraded.

@ High longitudinal stick forces are present at low speed.

@ The aircraft is very sensitive at high speed (600 knot limit).

@ There is no ARI available.

@ There is no automatic trim.

@ The maximum available AOA is approximately 21 units at touchdown
speed.

Perform a controllability check, if practical. Avoid high sink rates - fly
18-unit AOA on final.

CAS Off, Roll Ratio Emergency

Roll ratio goes to fixed midrange authority, and no additional authority is
available from CAS.

@ Reduced roll rates at all speeds.
@ High lateral stick forces are present.

@ No ARI.

Approach and landing are difficult in crosswind, turbulence, or with an
asymmetric load.

Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_39.jpeg:
FLIGHT LIMITATIONS

Limits that apply to the F-15K are contained in the Dash 1. In addition,
limits that apply to the aircrew are contained in Air Force and field level
regulations (AFI 11-206, AFI 11-214).

Speed Limits

The F-15E airspeed limit is never greater than 800 KCAS/2.5M and is
usually going to be less than that. Look at the aircraft configuration, consult
the Dash 1 and determine the most restrictive limit that applies. The actual
limit may vary with phase of flight.

Some of these limits can easily be exceeded (e.g., stores employment and
jettison limits), and it is the crew’s responsibility to keep things under control
(i.e., there are no speed warning cues except for some TF cautions on the
HUD).

G Limits

Due to engine considerations, negative Gs are limited to 7 seconds and
steady-state zero G is prohibited. The positive G limit and current G state
are presented on the HUD via the overload warning system. In order for this
system to compute properly, the crew must program the PACS correctly.
Even more importantly, stores limits are not included in OWS computation,
and some are easy to exceed.

CG Limits

For the clean aircraft, CG stays well inside the limits throughout the flight.
As internal fuel burns, the CG moves aft, and the aircraft becomes less stable
as the flight progresses. For a CFT configured aircraft, the CG moves
forward as CFT fuel is burned and then moves aft again as internal fuel
burns. CG limits require some thought when expendable stores are loaded.
Exceeding CG limits, particularly the aft limit, affects handling qualities.
These limits are even more important in the event of a CAS failure.

Roll Limits

The Dash 1 list is long. Most of these limitations were established to
minimize the effects of coupling and reduce the risk of departure and
structural overload. High roll rate, long duration situations are the ones
prohibited. These limits should not restrict normal air-to-air or air-to-ground
operations.

AOA Limits

For conditions that are not departure resistant, AOA is limited to 30 units.
These include:

@ Lateral asymmetry over 8000 ft-lbs without external tanks.

@ Lateral asymmetry over 5000 ft-lbs with any external tank(s).
With A/G stores or cargo pods loaded (except for SUU-20B/A on stations 2

THE FLIGHT ENVELOPE

The F-15E, like any other aircraft, is free to rove the entire atmosphere at
will, as long as you remain within the boundaries prescribed by stall, thrust
and airspeed. The limits of this G designed flight envelope are not hard
boundaries and can be penetrated, but not without some consequences.
Further, the limits of the envelope change with aircraft configuration. The
general level flight envelope is represented in Figure D-1.

OPS-02-01

Figure D - 1. Flight Envelope.

The limits of the flight envelope are formed by airspeed (maximum dynamic
pressure) on the lower right, Mach (heating) on the upper right, engine thrust
on the top and angle of attack on the left. Knowledge of the limits of this
envelope is important to safely operate the F-15E.

D-1 OPS-2


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_8.jpeg:
Airspeed Limit

The lower right edge of the flight envelope is formed by a maximum allowable
calibrated airspeed. This limit is based on the structural strength of the
airframe and represents the maximum dynamic pressure (referred to as Q)
the aircraft can withstand without permanent deformation. This limitation
applies primarily at lower altitudes and becomes even more of a factor with
external stores loaded. Exceeding the limit may cause control problems due
to airframe twisting and eventually causes airframe damage.

Mach Limit

At high Mach numbers (above 2.0), aerodynamic heating becomes a
significant factor. Aluminum alloys rapidly lose strength at elevated
temperatures, effectively reducing the maximum dynamic pressure the
airframe can support. Thus, the Mach limit is an extension of the airspeed
limit.

Since airframe heating is not instantaneous, time-limited dashes are
permitted (e.g., 2.5M through 2.3M for one minute). In addition to airframe
limits, temperature inside intake ducts rises rapidly with increased Mach,
and engine front-face temperatures can become a problem. This limitation
exists at higher altitudes where high Mach flight is achievable. The penalty
for exceeding this limit is much the same as exceeding the airspeed limit.
Additionally, elevated temperatures in the inlet ducts affect engine life.

Thrust Limit

This limit represents the absolute altitude that can be achieved and level
flight maintained. (The max rate of climb, without losing airspeed, is zero.)
This limit is very sensitive to gross weight, drag and engine performance.

The limit is not terribly important in normal operations, but could be a factor
if operating single engine in mountainous terrain with a load of ordnance.
This limit can be exceeded with a zoom climb or when losing an engine at
altitude.

Generally, exceeding this limit causes no difficulty in itself; the result is that
the aircraft descends back into the envelope.

OPS-2 D-2


Text from OPS-2_AHC_page_9.jpeg:
Angle of Attack (AOA) Limit

The left edge of the flight envelope equates to the maximum usable lift
characteristics of the aircraft. At lower speeds, C,, MAX is normally the limit.
At higher speeds, buffet or undesirable handling characteristics become the
limit.

AOA limitations are an operational factor at all altitudes, airspeeds and
configurations. These limitations effectively determine how well the pilot is
able to alter/control the flight path. Exceeding AOA limitations results in
decreased performance, stall and/or departure from controlled flight. AOA is
the key to performance and is the parameter of most concern when we talk
about “max performing” the aircraft. In fact, AOA is the dominant factor
even when operating well inside the envelope.

Performance within the Envelope

The two primary controls are the stick and throttles, which control AOA and
thrust. For most operations, the pilot controls AOA with the stick and the
amount of thrust selected by the throttles. The pilot generally thinks in
terms of controlling attitude and airspeed, but it is AOA (and its associated
lift and drag coefficients) that determines performance.

F-15E Cockpit AOA Displays

An indication of AOA appears constantly in the front cockpit on the AOA
gauge, which displays AOA in arbitrary units from 0 to 45. AOA is also
displayed on the HUD and the ADI at all times. Although there is an AOA
indication on the HUD, it is important to learn to estimate AOA by aircraft
response and “feel.”

sample problem presented will use the transition configuration, typical of
your first few transition sorties.

Runway 26

Wind 280/30G40
Temperature 68° F
Takeoff Gross Weight 60,000 lbs

Gotchas

There are several places in performance charts where important
information is often overlooked. Most performance charts have a
configuration entry. The configuration sometimes states “individual drag
indexes,” “flaps and gear retracted, all drag indexes,” or “without CFTs.”

There are other items to check also. Look for notes which contain
definitive information (e.g., preclimb figures for time, distance, and fuel).
The chart title can also include such things as gear and flap configuration,
gross weight, power settings, and engine type. Some charts look alike, so
it is imperative that you read the small print on these charts. If you are
careless, it is easy to get into the wrong chart and get some very
misleading data.

Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD)

Wind Components

Before computing TOLD, the wind components and density ratio must be
computed. The Wind Components Chart is on the back cover of your
checklist.

This chart is used to break down the wind into head/tail and crosswind
components. You must add half of the gust velocity to the steady state
velocity.

Given:
Wind 280/30G40
Runway 26

Find: (Figure D-1)
Headwind and crosswind components.
Enter with the relative bearing of the wind and wind speed on the arcs.

For example, 280° wind - 260° runway = 20° off RWY HDG. Given 30G40
and G = 10, add 5 kts to get 35 kts effective wind speed.

OPS-3

1:

This speed must be adjusted for headwind/tailwind (33
knots) so the abort speed in this example is 179 knots.

The maximum abort speed chart does not take into account
barrier engagement, but only aircraft stopping performance
for the given field conditions. Any abort above this speed
must have a successful cable engagement to stop on the
runway.

Lower weight aircraft are often shown to have lower
maximum abort speeds than higher weight aircraft. This is
because they accelerate to a faster speed during the abort
decision period used in the calculations, thus a lower
decision speed must be used.


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_17.jpeg:
Minimum Go Speed

The Minimum Go Speed chart was developed to let the aircrew know
when it would be possible to continue the takeoff in a heavyweight single
engine situation. There is no Minimum Go Speed chart in the checklist, so
you must use TO 1F-15E-1-1. This chart was built such that, at the
indicated minimum go speed, you can suffer an engine failure, take 3
seconds to make a decision, and still make it off the ground. In the case of
a military thrust takeoff, another 3 seconds is allowed to push the good
throttle to max AB. Use a 10° pitch attitude for all single engine takeoffs.

Given:

Aircraft with CFTs, maximum thrust takeoff, -220 engines

Density Ratio 0.98

Available Runway Length 11,000 feet (dry)
Takeoff Gross Weight 60,000 lbs
Takeoff Gross Weight (Combat) 80,000 lbs

Find: (Figure D-4)
Minimum go speed for both gross weights.

Enter with density ratio on the left side. Project across to the available

runway length. Parallel the nearest guideline to intersect the baseline.

From that intersection, move to intersect the gross weight line and then
read left to determine minimum go speed. The dotted lines are used for
air-to-ground weapons or fuel tanks on the wing stations.

Figure D - 4.

The minimum go speed for combat (Figure D-4) is 166 KCAS. For practice
load gross weights less than 75,000 lbs, the minimum go speed is not

available at standard temperatures and lower altitudes. The high

minimum go speed at heavy weight makes the decision to abort more
critical.

OPS-3


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_19.jpeg:
Note: The minimum go speed for a maximum thrust takeoff is less
than that for a military thrust takeoff due to the greater
acceleration achieved by being in afterburner from the start of
takeoff up to and including the 3 second decision time. There is
more runway still available for acceleration on the one engine.

WARNING

If an engine is lost above the maximum
abort speed but below the minimum go
speed, the pilot can neither abort nor take
off safely on the runway length remaining
without considering such factors as
reducing gross weight or engaging the
arrestment cable.

Referring back to the maximum abort speed chart (Figure D-3) the
maximum abort speed is about 141 knots for an 80,000 pound aircraft
which means that between 141 and 166 knots you would need a cable to
stop.

Rule of Thumb:

At Seymour Johnson, with an available runway length greater than
11,000 feet, a density ratio above .9, and a gross weight of less than
65,000 lbs, the minimum go speed will not usually be a factor.

The takeoff distance on the chart is 2100 feet. However, the chart is
based on a maximum performance takeoff using 12° of pitch and no wind
(Figure D-5, Note 3). For our normal 10° takeoff, you must add 10% to the
takeoff distance.

The maximum takeoff distance would then be 2310 feet (2100 x 110%).
With a headwind component of 33 knots the takeoff roll will obviously be

less.

Notes: 1. Since the charts offer limited choices, you must interpolate
for varying temperatures, altitudes, and gross weights.

2. Ifa significant tail wind exits (more than 10 knots), you
must use the charts in TO 1F-15E-1-1.

Rotation Speed/Nosewheel Liftoff Speed/Takeoff Speed
The point at which the nose comes off the ground, and when the aircraft
starts flying, depends on gross weight, position of the center of gravity
(CG), and the amount of thrust. Thrust affects both the pitching moment
and the ability to hold the nose up. This is a relatively simple chart in the
checklist and it also gives a brief description of normal takeoff procedures.

Landing Speed and Distance

During planning, you should compute landing data for an emergency
heavyweight landing as well as a normal end of mission landing.

The charts offer two landing roll-out techniques:

1. Aerodynamic Braking

2. Maximum Antiskid Braking
As you will see in the following examples and due to the minimal
deceleration above 100 knots with antiskid, aerodynamic braking is the
recommended technique, especially when heavyweight or landing on a wet

runway.

Notes: 1. All landing distances are based on speed brake extension at
touchdown.

2. Ifa significant tailwind exists (more than 10 knots), you
must use the charts in TO 1F-15E-1-1.

The following four landing distance charts compute landing distance
under the given conditions.

The approach speed is still 184 knots.
The landing distance is 7250 feet dry/12,550 feet wet.

Note: There is a 300 foot difference dry and a 3850 foot difference wet

which exceeds the available runway. For a wet runway, you must plan for
a departure-end cable, reduce weight, or use aerobraking.

D-27 OPS-3


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_34.jpeg:
Rule of Thumb:

To compute a backup approach speed for 21 units AOA, use 155 Knots
+ (2 X fuel remaining in thousands of pounds)

Example: 10,000 lbs of fuel remaining
155 + 20 = 175 knot approach speed
If making a no flap approach add 15 knots
155 + 15 + 20 = 190 knot approach speed
Remember to add the extra weight of unexpected stores to fuel weight if

applicable. CFTs, Pylons/Pods and SUUs are included in the 155 knot
baseline.

Landing Distance Rules of Thumb:

Lower nose by 100 knots to keep control of nose drop. Do not raise flaps in
aerobrake unless runway is icy. Lower nose NLT 2 runway remaining.

Keep CAS < 2 X runway remaining marker X 10.

If runway length is greater than fuel remaining, landing distance on a dry
runway is within limits.

Maximum Cable Engagement Speeds

Due to the light structure of the F-15E hook system, there are limits on
cable engagement ground speeds. When planning an approach-end cable
engagement or the possibility of a departure-end cable engagement exists
(wet runway), compute the maximum cable engagement ground speed
from the chart in the emergency section of the checklist (Figure D-12).
When flying an approach for an approach-end cable engagement, it is good
technique to have ground speed displayed on the HUD and to consider the
effect of surface winds on calibrated airspeed in anticipation of cable
engagement ground speed.

OPS-3


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_36.jpeg:
Rule of Thumb:

Heavy weight landings begin with full weights in excess of 10,000 lbs. For
a transition configured aircraft, plan to dump fuel to 7000 lbs or less for
an approach-end cable engagement. This will allow an engagement below
160 knots ground speed.

Climb/Cruise Charts

These checklist charts are dual-purpose, with a climb section at the top,
and four different optimum cruise sections below based on the fuel
remaining. Each chart is based on a specific drag index and engine type.
Recommended climb schedules are also included on the charts.

For training, use the DI = 40 chart for transition and air-to-air missions,
and the DI = 60 chart for surface attack missions. For combat
heavyweight loads, compute the DI and use the chart with a DI equal or
higher, if available, or you must use the charts in

TO 1F-15E-1-1.

Climb Section

This section of the chart is used to determine time, distance, and fuel
remaining to reach the desired altitude. Preclimb data and assumptions
are included at the bottom of the chart.

Notes: 1. Climb charts are based on a sea level takeoff. Takeoffs
from a higher altitude will result in actual time/
distance/fuel numbers slightly lower than those computed.

2. The checklist charts all assume military power climbs. For
maximum power climbs use the climb charts in
TO 1F-15E-1-1.

3. Fuel for start, taxi, run-up and takeoff to the start climb
point are included in the checklist charts. However, the
assumptions made may be unrealistic. For precise data,
refer to the climb charts in TO 1F-15E-1-1.

OPS-3 D - 30


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_37.jpeg:
4. These charts are still based on JP-4 fuel. The starting fuel
will be about 1000 lbs greater with JP-8. Using the chart
numbers will be conservative.

5. Time to climb is in decimal format; 1.45 minutes is 1
minute and 27 seconds.

For optimum cruise data, select the section which corresponds to your fuel
situation. Normally, use the “at level-off pounds remaining” for the
majority of the mission; use the appropriate 2000/5000/10,000 pounds
remaining section for RTB or divert planning. If you select an altitude
below optimum cruise, data is provided for optimum airspeed conditions at

Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_41.jpeg:
Rule of Thumb:

With a drag index below 40, 100 pounds/minute is a conservative fuel
consumption at optimum altitude and airspeed.

Emergency Divert

To plan a maximum range divert in a fuel critical situation, refer to the
“Fuel Used to Divert, PW-220 Engine” chart in the emergency section of
the checklist. This chart provides fuel data for two “no-wind” divert
options:

1. Climb from sea level to optimum divert altitude, cruise and
descent back to sea level.

2. Cruise at sea level throughout the divert.

In all cases, the climb/cruise/descent profile uses less total fuel but over
diverts of less than 50 nm, the difference is negligible.

Note 6 at the bottom of the chart is critical. You must add landing fuel to
determine if you should attempt the divert. The minimum planned fuel at
the divert field is 2000 pounds for Seymour Johnson aircraft.

Note: For a given amount of fuel (1000 lbs) in JP-8, there will be a
smaller volume than if JP-4. However, thrust is based partly on
mass of fuel. Therefore if 1000 lbs is required by the chart and
you have 1000 lbs of JP-8 you will be able to go about the same
distance.

OPS-03-15

Figure D - 15.

The total fuel used to divert at 33,000 feet is 1700 pounds. The climb
speed (note 4) would be 350 KCAS/.88 M. Cruise at .80 Mach and descend
at 220 KCAS (note 5) when 57 nm from destination.

Notes: 1. 57% of your 100 nm divert is in a descent. It also took
about 25 nm to climb. Therefore, short diverts will include
very little cruise at optimum altitude.

2. Diversion at sea level will use about 700 lbs more. For a
diversion of 50 nm, you only save 200 lbs by climbing to
18,000 feet.

3. Do not forget to add landing fuel.

4. The divert chart is located in the last few pages of the EP
portion of the checklist.

Cruise Data Display

Cruise data is on the engine monitor display (EMD) (Figure D-16) to
provide the aircrew a recommended flight profile based on optimizing for
max range and comparing this range to the straightline ground range to
his base or other specified navigation point. These calculations are
computed using data for the P229 engines rather than P220 engines. This
will give you a slightly pessimistic fuel figure.

Figure D - 16. Engine/Cruise Data.

The aircrew enters the sequence point desired as the terminus by
scratchpad transfer from the UFC to PB #10. The system defaults to
BASE at power-up as the return point at power-up with weight on wheels.
The current straightline range to the selected point appears above the
entry.

D - 37 OPS-3


Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_44.jpeg:
The aircrew enters the desired ending (reserve) fuel by scratchpad
transfer to PB #8. The system defaults to 1200 pounds at power-up with
weight on wheels, and this is also the minimum allowable value. Values
less than 1200 pounds or more than the current fuel quantity will not be
accepted. At Seymour Johnson minimum fuel is 1900 pounds.

The max cruise profile is based on the aircraft performing a standard,
constant airspeed climb to the recommended altitude, cruising at that
altitude at the recommended airspeed, and making a standard descent to
the destination. Drag indices are implied from aircraft weight.

For weights under 55,000 pounds, the climb is a constant airspeed climb
at 350 KCAS to 0.90 M to the recommended altitude.

For weights over 55,000 pounds it is a 300 KCAS to 0.75 M climb.
The descent is based on idle power, 220 KCAS, speed brake retracted.

Optimum cruise altitude and airspeed are presented on the cruise data
display on the MPD engine display as “Command Altitude” and
“Command Mach.”

The system then subtracts the fuel used to ascend from the current
altitude to the cruise altitude, the fuel consumed during the descent from
cruise altitude to the destination, and the end (reserve) fuel from the fuel
available. The resultant fuel available for cruise is divided by the fuel
consumption rate to determine the max time at optimum cruise altitude.
Cruise time is converted to cruise range using nominal true airspeed and
current winds to calculate ground speed.

Time to climb, time to cruise, and time to descend are summed to give
total time in max cruise profile, which is displayed to the aircrew.

Distance covered during climb, distance covered during cruise, and

distance covered during descent are summed to give total range in max
cruise profile, which is displayed to the aircrew.

Divert Rules of Thumb:

While determining precise divert data, you can save fuel by using the
following ROTs as soon as you determine a divert is needed.

1.

2.

7.

Put your divert base on the nose.

Climb in mil power at 350 K/.88 Mach (DI < 40)

. Climb to 1/8 the divert distance (maximum of 47,000 ft)

Example: Divert Distance = 90 nm
Climb to 30,000 ft

(Do not use more than ‘% of your fuel in the climb).

. Cruise at Max Range AOA:

14 units if below 25,000 ft
14.5 units if above 25,000 ft

. Begin your descent at twice your altitude in miles from

destination.

Example: Cruise Altitude = 30,000 ft
Begin descent 60 nm out

Based on “no-wind.” Decrease range for a headwind, increase for a
tailwind.

. Descend at Max Endurance AOA or 220 knots:

17.0 units if above 25,000 ft
18.0 units if below 25,000 ft

Enter data on the cruise data display on the MPD engine display and

compare to the checklist divert charts for precise data as soon as you are
able.

emergency diverts when some or all of the landing gear is extended.

For transition/air-to-air missions, the drag index will be about 123, with
all gear extended. Use the first chart (Figure D-17) for a constant altitude
cruise.

At sea level, the fuel flow is 120 pounds/minute.

70 nm at 250 KCAS = 17 minutes
120 pounds/minute X 17 minutes = 2040 pounds

At 15,000 ft, the fuel flow is 107 pounds/minutes.

Note: There is little difference made by climbing with a high drag
index and in this case you may actually use more fuel.

The drag index is again 123.

The airspeed is 209 KCAS at the closest drag index.

The fuel flow is 109 lbs/minute at sea level and 100 lbs/minute at 10,000
feet.

Note: The fuel used to climb exceeds the advantage of slightly lower
fuel flow at altitude. With turbine engines, there is little to be
saved by climbing for short periods of holding below 10,000 ft.

Stopping Distance Charts

Stopping distance charts were added with change 3 to the F-15E-1CL-1.
There is general agreement that the stopping distance charts are not as
useful as they could be. Data is incomplete and charts for aerobraking on
wet and icy runways are not provided. Another observation is that the
numbers are slightly in conflict with the landing distance charts. For
example, the landing distance charts all show that aerobraking is better
than max antiskid. The stopping distance charts show the opposite. (For
minimum run landings with all kinds of runway conditions, see

TO 1F-15E-1, pages 2-22 and 7-3.) The questions are “what is the
difference between landing and stopping distance?” and “when do crews
need to use both sets of data?” Current guidance and the AFMSS (Air
Force Mission Support System) only require aircrews to calculate landing
distance (normal and heavyweight, wet and dry runway) and landing
distance charts assume landing over a 50-foot obstacle, whereas stopping
distance charts only consider the distance required to stop.

Considering only the stopping distance charts, simple rule of thumb
conclusions would be:

Runway Condition

Dry Max antiskid braking as soon as possible*

Wet or icy Aerobrake until the nose falls through, then
max antiskid braking to a stop.

*According to the stopping distance charts, aerobraking on a dry runway
results in slightly longer stopping distances, but probably saves wear and
tear on the brakes. For maintenance reasons, you might want to
aerobrake anyway, but if you decide to use max antiskid you should
consider use of speed brake as another form of aerobraking.

Text from OPS-3_Performance_Data_page_52.jpeg:
Wind Shear and Microburst Activity

Wind shear is beyond the scope of this course and will sometimes be
addressed as a special topic in instrument refresher training. There is no
clear guidance in TO 1F-15E-1, but a good technique would be to compute
a reference ground speed (approach speed corrected for known winds),
have ground speed displayed on the HUD, and Data 1 displayed on the
UFC. Ifthe aircrew is in the habit of including displayed ground speed as
compared to reference ground speed in their cross-check, the need for an
immediate go-around due to unsuspected wind shear and microburst
activity would be more readily apparent. As was mentioned earlier in the
discussion on approach-end cable engagements, knowing your planned
versus actual ground speed on final and having the WSO cross-check the
UFC for winds can help for wind shear detection, cable engagements, and
landing distances.

Combat Planning

For combat missions, there are other factors that must be considered. As
mentioned earlier, with heavier gross weights, minimum go speeds
become important. In addition, the mission length may cause fuel
computations to be critical. You will need to run computations for each
phase of flight. You need to figure fuel used in a heavyweight climb and
cruise to the descent point; time, fuel and distance to descend; and the
higher fuel rates for low level ingress. You then need to refigure the
return portion of flight using the same charts, in reverse order at the
lighter weights following ordnance delivery.

There are a few charts in the checklist for high drag indices and fuel

configurations, but most of the time you will need to use a computer
program or go to TO 1F-15E-1-1.

GENERAL INFORMATION

This workbook is intended to be used with your Dash 1 checklist,
Performance Data with F100-PW-220 engines, using JP-8 fuel weights, to
familiarize you with the information available for the F-15E. However,
some data is only found in TO 1F-15E-1-1.

Although F-15E mission data may be computed using AFMSS or other
software mission planning programs (to be taught in other lessons), the
aircrew must be able to compute all required information using the
checklist and other charts when a computer is not available.

Aircrews are required to compute and have the following takeoff and
landing data (TOLD) on their mission data (lineup) cards: acceleration
check speed (N/A for F-15E until appropriate performance data is
incorporated in the Dash 1), refusal/maximum abort speed (dry/wet),
takeoff speed and distance, normal/heavyweight landing distance
(dry/wet), and single engine takeoff speed (SETOS). At present, this is an
Air Combat Command (ACC) requirement only.

Weight And Drag Index

Several charts require drag index (DI) and gross weight (GW) values.
Specific drag indexes and gross weight data for external stores are found
in the Station Loading charts, Part 1 of Appendix A of

TO 1F-15E-1-1.

The drag index for a specific configuration is found by multiplying the
number of stores carried by its drag index, and adding the drag index of
the suspension equipment. Always use a checklist chart of a higher drag
index than you have computed (i.e., round “up” to be conservative). Gross
weight computations are made the same as drag computations with JP-8
fuel weights.

AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_10.jpeg:
The automatic pitch trim feature and the relative stability of the F-15E
significantly reduce the problem of maintaining proper position. Proper
position can be maintained with relatively small throttle and control stick
adjustments.

The large wingspan, combined with a wing well aft of the cockpit, requires
the fingertip formation position to be flown well forward of the leader’s
wing line. The above references are established to provide wingtip
clearance and enable you to maintain a stable position. Since the fan lags
the core engine response, every throttle movement is followed by an
additional delayed thrust change. Anticipate this delayed thrust response
when making changes. Additionally, due to the nature of stick force
sensor, a “white knuckle” grip on the stick tends to cause jerky flight
control inputs. Use a relaxed grip.

Common Errors

@ Overcontrolling power.

Flying too close.

Overcontrolling roll and/or pitch.

Focusing on one reference, and not using all references to crosscheck
for good position.

Weather Position

Weather formation in the F-15E may require some adjustment in your
formation procedures. There are some considerations that are
particularly noteworthy. The flight control system produces excellent
handling qualities that enhance formation flying. When flying fingertip
formation in turbulent conditions, do not attempt to rapidly counteract
every gust with control inputs. Remember, your leader is flying in the
same patch of air and both your aircraft and his react in a similar manner
to rough air.

When flying formation in the weather, a little more of the lead or
reference aircraft is needed by the wingman. This position produces
significant wingtip overlap; therefore, if you lose sight, immediately
execute the applicable lost wingman procedure.

Echelon
Echelon formation is generally used in the traffic pattern for landing or to
get all wingmen on one side when the leader plans to turn away from the

formation.

Visual References

The relative position on the leader or preceding aircraft is the same as
fingertip. Avoid turns into the echelon, if at all possible. If making a turn
into the echelon, each aircraft maintains the same relative position as for
straight and level flight. On turns away from the echelon, maintain the
fuselages in the same horizontal plane (Figure D-5) to ensure the aircraft
is in fingertip upon roll out. Fore/aft position is maintained by keeping
the preceding aircraft's intake ramp leading edge on the pilot’s helmet.

Common Errors

@ A tendency to get behind initially by not matching lead’s rate of roll, or
pull and/or not adding power, and then adjusting too late and/or
overcontrolling.

@ Climbing at the beginning of the turn.

Route

Route (Figure D-6) is an extension of fingertip formation with up to
approximately 500 feet between aircraft. It allows the wingman increased
mission crosscheck time and enhances the ability to clear for the
formation when tactical formation is not practical. Route position is also
used for rejoins.

Visual References

@ Line up the anticollision light under the UHF antenna as in fingertip.

@ Fly out to a maximum of 500 feet.

@ When turned into, stack down as necessary to stay out of lead's
maneuvering plane and to keep lead in sight.

Cross-unders

The cross-under is an integral part of close formation. It is the disciplined
and safe way to change formation so that lead and the wingmen know
how, when and what to do.

Procedures

Some of these moves or procedures are done simultaneously. However, in
the learning stages each move should be perfected before combining.

After receiving the prebriefed voice or visual signal for a cross-under,
pull back power slightly.

Drop down slightly to be clear of lead’s jetwash, remembering your
aircraft’s tails are tall.

Establish nose-tail separation, and add power slightly to stop aft
movement.

Use a small bank angle to change heading 2-3° and add power to
cross-under to the same relative position on the other side and readjust
power to stop the overtake/closure. Align your heading with lead's
heading.

Add power slightly to move forward and up, with wingtip clearance,
into close formation, and stabilize.

D-9 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_16.jpeg:
If Number Two is required to cross-under in a flight of three or more,
Number Three must move out wider to make room for Number Two. Once
Number Two moves forward, Three reforms on Two’s wing.

When an element performs a cross-under, the element drops below and aft
for nose-tail clearance. Number Four also crosses Three during the

element cross-under.

Common Errors

@ Excessive power changes.

@ Too fast for conditions or proficiency.

@ Dropping too far aft or too low.

@ Getting tails (rudders) in lead’s jet wash.

@ Dishing out or moving too wide in the new position.

@ Element or Number Three moves too wide as Number Two assumes
new position.

Trail Formation Exercise
The purpose of the trail formation (Figure D-8) as described in this lesson
is to increase the student’s “heads-out” piloting skills in the F-15E and to

improve his/her skill in three-dimensional maneuvering with respect to
another aircraft.

Night Formation
The position is the same as Day Fingertip but the references are different.

Visual References

The fore/aft reference is placing the wingtip formation light one length in
front of the tail formation light.

The vertical reference is placing the wingtip formation light about 1/2 foot
above a line between the nose and the tail formation lights (Figure D-9).
For night weather formation position, slide back to put the wingtip light
halfway between the fuselage lights.

OPS-4 D-12


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_19.jpeg:
The vertical tail floodlights aid in maintaining formation position. When
in formation, lead has anti-collision lights off and position lights steady.
All others are lit the same except the last aircraft keeps the anti-collision
lights on unless briefed otherwise by lead.

Staring at one light can cause it to appear to move, thereby creating

confusion for the wingman and a dangerous situation. Keep eyes moving,

using all references.

Procedures

@ 3800 feet spacing for taxi on the centerline.

@ No visual signals at night except for no radio (NORDO).

@ Lead changes are called over the radio in wings level flight.

@ No lead changes below 1500 feet AGL unless on GCA downwind.

@ If the flight splits up, lead calls attitude, airspeed, altitude and
altimeter setting, and the wingman must acknowledge and confirm

good navigation aids.

@ Formation landings will only be made at night for safe aircraft
recovery.

@ When in positions other than fingertip, route, or tactical, aircraft
spacing will be maintained primarily by instruments, radar/AAI,
and/or timing with visual reference secondary. If aircraft spacing
cannot be ensured, altitude separation (minimum of 1000 feet) will be
established. At all times, aircrews will crosscheck instruments to
ensure ground clearance.

FORMATION TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS

Formation Takeoffs

Procedures

Fore/aft reference is head abeam UHF antenna.

Wingman lines up assuring wingtip clearance.

80% power is selected upon runup signal.

Brakes are released on lead’s head nod.

Power is advanced to full AB and adjusted as necessary.

Tap brakes (if necessary) to prevent overrunning lead.

Maintain lateral and fore/aft position and match lead’s rotation.

The flight leader will retract gear and flaps when the wingman is
observed to be safely airborne. If no visual signal is briefed, the
wingman’s cue to retract gear and flaps is when lead's nose gear door
opens.

Transition to fingertip references and assume that position after gear
and flap retraction. The WSO must devote primary attention to
monitoring the engines, warnings and cautions, and gear/flap

retraction since the pilot is devoting primary attention to formation
positioning.

Four-Ship Line-Up

For four-ship line-up (Figure D-10), it is important for Number Two to
line-up with his inside pylon on the runway centerline. This position
allows both Number Three and Four to move into position. Number Three
positions himself to the outside, aligning helmets. Four’s position is in
tight between Number One and Two, pulling forward of the tails far
enough to see both pilot and WSO in Number Three’s jet. This position
keeps Number Four out of the lead element’s jet wash during their
run-up. An alternative is a 2 + 2 lineup with 500 foot element spacing.

Takeoff Restrictions

Formation takeoffs will not be made when:

@ There are more than two ship elements.

@ Aircraft are more than 3000 lbs difference in weight.

e@ Aircraft are not symmetrically loaded.

@ The runway width is less than 125 feet.

@ There is standing water, ice, slush or snow on the runway.
@ The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.

@ Carrying live air-to-ground munitions.

@ Ferrying from contractor/AFMC.

@ Computed takeoff roll exceeds 70% of available runway.

Formation Takeoff Aborts

Formation abort procedures must be briefed and thoroughly understood
by all flight members. Ifa flight member aborts, the first priority is
aircraft control. A radio call should be made when control is assured to
alert the other flight members. Make every effort to maintain the
appropriate side of the runway.

OPS-4 D-16


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_23.jpeg:
Formation Landings

Wingman Procedures

Configure when signaled and use approximately 1/2 speedbrake as
briefed.

When VMC on final:

@ Stack level with lead. A good reference for stacking level with lead is
to position the aircraft so that the leader’s opposite MPD is visible.
Another vertical reference is lead’s helmet on the true horizon; you
should also be able to see 6-8 inches of the opposite engine hump.

@ Align abeam UHF antenna.
@ Maintain a minimum of 10 feet wingtip clearance.

Fly formation to touchdown, but crosscheck runway approaching flare and
touchdown. Anticipate power reduction and flare.

After touchdown, maintain your side of the runway and aerobrake as soon
as prudent (to approximately 13° of pitch with fully extended speed
brake).

If the wingman overruns the leader, accept the overrun and maintain the
appropriate side of the runway and aircraft control. Do not attempt
reposition behind the leader. The most important consideration is wingtip
clearance.

D-17 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_24.jpeg:
Landing Restrictions

Formation landings will not be made when:

There are more than two ship elements.

There is not a straight-in approach (precision preferred).
Combined fuel/stores weight is greater than 10,000 pounds.

There is more than 3000 lbs difference in weight.

Aircraft are not symmetrically loaded.

The runway width is less than 125 feet.

The runway is wet or icy, or there is slush or snow on the runway.
The crosswind or gust component exceeds 10 knots.

The wingman is not upwind with a crosswind greater than 5 knots.

Landing with hung ordnance or unexpended live ordnance, excluding
live air-to-air munitions.

The weather is less than 500 feet and 1.5 nm, or your weather
category, whichever is greater.

Common Errors

Flying too low or too far back.

Not maintaining proper wingtip spacing.

Making corrections too large or too fast, thus overcontrolling.

Not compensating for different handling characteristics at slow speed.

Not aerobraking or maintaining your side of the runway.

OPS-4 D-18


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_25.jpeg:
JOIN-UPS
General

Any join-up requires an accurate appraisal of position and closure. The
low drag nature of the airframe and relative effectiveness of the speed
brake requires some anticipation for throttle reduction. If desired, obtain
an auto acquisition lock-on and select GUN or SRM mode during the
rejoin to provide additional range and overtake information. (Note:
Reference TO 1F-15E-34-1-1 for information on the HUD gun display.
Remember that Vc includes angular closure, so watch your airspeed, too).

@ NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF LEAD.
@ Join in sequence.

@ Adhere to the weather restrictions of 1500/3 for day join-ups and
3000/5 for night join-ups.

Turning Join-Ups

Lead Procedures

@ Maintain airspeed of 350 KCAS, unless otherwise briefed/called.
@ Maintain a bank angle of 30° or less.

Wingman Procedures

Join on the inside of the turn. Number Two remains on the inside, and
Numbers Three and Four slide to the outside. Four crosses behind Three
as the element crosses behind the lead element. A radar lock-on will
provide range and overtake information.

Techniques to control overtake include:

@ Maintain approximately 400 KCAS = about 50-100 knots of actual
overtake (Vc).

@ Use bank angle control for fore/aft position.
@ Airspeed advantage and cut-off together provide the closure rate.

@ For vertical separation, keep lead slightly above the horizon.

D-19 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_26.jpeg:
Use bank angle to get inside lead’s turn.

Align with an extension of normal fingertip fore/aft position.
Superimpose lead's far tail over outside wingtip.

Maintain position with bank angle and G as necessary.

Strive to keep fuselage aligned with lead’s.

Maintaining airspeed advantage, cut off, and fuselage aligned with lead
provides smooth decrease of lateral separation. At approximately 3000
feet, start power reduction to control overtake. The overtake at 1500 feet
should be about 50 knots—do not stagnate here.

Stabilize in route, and then slide to fingertip. When the overtake is
excessive, initiate a controlled overshoot.

Reduce bank angle, keep lead (flight) in sight, ensure nose-tail
separation and pass behind and below lead. Slide to the outside of the
turn. Do not slide forward of lead.

Stabilize, smoothly cross back under, move back to route and then slide
to fingertip.

Both crew members should monitor the rejoin to prevent late
recognition of an overshoot situation.

Common Errors

Dropping too low.

Not establishing quick, proper cut-off.
Matching airspeed too soon and stagnating.
Fixation with radar and HUD.

Not recognizing, or properly accomplishing, an overshoot.

OPS-4 D - 20


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_27.jpeg:
Straight Ahead Join-Up
Lateral separation and overtake are very difficult to judge, and the F-15E
provides a fairly small visual profile from the rear. This requires planning

and attention when performing the straight ahead rejoin.

Lead Procedures

Maintain 350 KCAS unless otherwise briefed/called.

Wingman Procedures

@ Aim for a lateral position 200-500 feet from lead.

@ Closure of 100-125 knots at 6000 feet is controllable.

@ Reduce overtake to reach 3000 feet with 50 knots closure.

@ Stabilize in route and smoothly move to fingertip.

@ Use the velocity vector as an aid by placing it just to the side of lead.

The technique of obtaining a radar lock-on is even more important here to
judge overtake.

If a controlled overshoot is required:
@ Maintain a position slightly below lead and turn slightly away.

@ Keep lead in sight, stabilize, and move back to route and then proceed
to the fingertip position.

@ Don’t cross control to lose speed (throttles and speedbrakes should be
sufficient)

Number Two normally joins on the left wing and the element joins on the
right wing unless otherwise briefed.

D-21 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_28.jpeg:
Common Errors

@ Too much overtake.

@ Matching airspeed too soon and stagnating.

@ Not recognizing or properly executing an overshoot.
VISUAL SIGNALS

Radio discipline is essential for the conduct of safe and effective formation
flight; therefore, visual signals are used whenever the situation allows.
These signals are the same as those used in other aircraft and are listed in
AFI 11-205 and in section H of this workbook.

When using visual signals for changing radio frequencies, additional
information is required to determine whether the change is meant for
radio 1 or radio 2. This is often prebriefed before flight if visual radio
frequency changes are anticipated. In the situation where a flight
member becomes “lost” on a particular radio frequency drill, it should be
obvious which radio is referenced.

LOST WINGMAN PROCEDURES
General

Execution of lost wingman procedures is principally an instrument
procedure, which should be initiated upon losing sight of lead, or if unable
to maintain formation due to spatial disorientation (SD). Lost wingman
procedures listed below are extracted from AFI 11-2F-15E, Vol 3,

Chapter 7. Note that the procedures while operating with a tanker are
different (refer to TO 1-1C-1-25).

@ Review lost wingman procedures before any mission involving night or
IMC.

@ Practicing lost wingman procedures (only VFR) is a good idea to see
the spacing obtained.

@ Do not penetrate dense cloud conditions unnecessarily in close
formation. Try radar trail formation or separate clearances. If you are
flying as a two-ship formation, the wingman usually has an easier time
if he flies on the right side of the formation.

OPS-4 D - 22


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_29.jpeg:
When you are flying on the wing, keep up with the navigation and
listen closely to clearances. Crosscheck your attitude whenever
feasible. When you anticipate entering the weather on the wing,
selecting an ADI on the MPD in the direction of lead allows you to
easily crosscheck attitude while flying formation. Maintain “situation
awareness.” Anticipate going “lost wingman.” Trim the aircraft and
concentrate on smooth, relaxed throttle and stick movements.

Notify the other crew member and the flight leader if you are
experiencing spatial disorientation. They may be able to establish a
wings-level attitude to clear your head, or give you the lead to allow
you to fly instruments for a short time.

When you can no longer maintain visual reference with your leader’s
aircraft in the briefed formation position, go lost wingman without
hesitation.

When you execute lost wingman procedures, smoothly transition to
your instruments and make the radio call when conditions permit.
Establish lateral, vertical and nose-tail clearance in a prompt but
controlled manner, and then stabilize your aircraft under instrument
flight conditions. Once you initiate the procedures, carry through until
you have control of your aircraft. Do not attempt to rejoin without
clearance from your flight leader!

Lead or aircraft with operational radio will obtain a separate clearance
for the remaining formation.

NORDO lost wingman will fly previous clearance and turn IFF/SIF to

NORMAL code 7600. If an emergency arises with radio failure, turn
the IFF/SIF to EMERGENCY for the remainder of the flight.

TACTICAL FORMATION
General

The standard combat formation employed by tactical fighters is the four-
ship flight. Within this formation, the two-ship element is the basic
fighting unit. The purpose of tactical formation is to combine firepower in
a disciplined, coordinated unit while providing mutual support against
threats. The various elements of the combat arena (weather, threats,
mission, flight size, etc.) determine the optimum position and role of each
flight member. The formations described here are applicable to both A/A
and A/S operations. As the tactical situation changes, positions,
responsibilities and maneuvering techniques change as well.

Formation Selection

Several criteria are addressed when selecting the best tactical formation
for a given mission.

@ Role/mission objectives

@ Threats-air and surface

@ Flight size

@ Flight leader/wingman capabilities

@ Ordnance capability versus air threats

@ Ordnance/fuel load—maneuvering capability
@ Tactics—low or medium altitude

@ Surface attack tactics/timing

@ Terrain

@ Weather-ceiling, visibility, TFR and FLIR
@ Support assets-GCI, EW, SEAD

@® Communication ROE-comm out, comm jamming

Visual Lookout

Formation Design

A tactical formation provides an offensive capability against enemy
aircraft while maintaining security against attack. The formation
selected, therefore, must allow flight members to detect and maneuver
against an attack before the attacker can achieve a lethal position.

Search Responsibility

The number of aircraft and their position within the formation is designed
to cope with the expected threat. In all tactical formations, each flight
member has a definite visual search responsibility. Even though each
pilot/WSO concentrates on a different area, this does not preclude
searching other areas when tasking, threats or the environment requires
it.

Visual Search Techniques
Limiting Factors

The threshold of visual detection depends upon factors such as aspect
angle, atmospheric conditions (haze, smoke, moisture), background, and
the condition of the helmet visor and canopy. Detection of threats at
maximum distance requires an efficient visual search pattern. Focus at a
distance of approximately 5 miles. With this focal point, the depth of FOV
approximates a range of 1 mile to infinity.

Focus Technique

Focus by initially viewing an object at the approximate detection range,
usually the ground. Once focused, various search patterns are used
(vertical, horizontal, etc.) depending upon individual preference.

However, no more than a 30° segment of the search area is scanned at one
time. After 20 to 30 seconds of searching empty sky, the eye focal distance
drifts back to a point less than 10 feet away. Before this occurs, refocus
and search another segment. Using these techniques, the aircrew can
establish a definite visual search pattern instead of random gazing.
Reference to canopy code and F-15E cockpit visibility charts can also
improve visual lookout techniques (Figures D-11 through D-14).

Basic Lookout Rules

@ Each crew member searches the entire FOV around his aircraft with
special emphasis on briefed areas of individual responsibility (See
Figure D-15).

@ The particular formation dictates the areas of responsibility (including
moving the aircraft to search blind spots).

@ Do not concentrate lookout near the horizontal plane of the formation.

© Do not forget the requirement to search 12:00, especially with the
advent of all-aspect enemy weapon systems. The HUD drives visual
concentration to the TD box. The F-15E pilot must guard against
channelizing visual attention on the TD box; instead the pilot must
search the full forward spectrum.

@ The use of a dark helmet visor or sunglasses may reduce visual
acquisition and detection range.

Two-Ship Tactical Formation

General

When planning the mission, the flight lead selects the best formation
(lateral spacing, vertical stack and wingman position) based on the threat,
tactics and maneuvering considerations. Different flight leaders brief a
given formation differently. Only the general concepts are described here.
Each unit has its own standards for tactical formation, and individual
flight leads add their specific requirements to meet the mission or training
objectives.

Maneuverability

Maneuverability is dependent upon:
@ Position and flight members’ ability.
@ Type of formation:

e Line abreast is best for visual mutual support, but it sacrifices some
maneuverability.

e Wedge formations are more maneuverable with the wingman
protecting lead, allowing lead to maneuver aggressively, but it
sacrifices some mutual support. Wedge is good in poor visibility
and at low altitude, where terrain blocks the bandit’s approach
avenues.

Two-Ship Line Abreast

Wingman is 0-30° back (Figure D-16) with 6000-12,000 feet lateral
spacing as briefed or locally prescribed/restricted.

Stack vertically at 2000-5000 feet or as briefed or locally
prescribed/restricted.

When a trend toward a parameter limit is detected, use power/altitude as
necessary to correct.

@ If high approaching aft limit, unload and trade altitude for airspeed to
reach fore/aft position with enough power to allow slow climb back to
altitude parameter. Converse to move aft.

@ If too close or too wide, use small heading changes. Keep track of

lead’s heading by listening, accurately noting new heading to turn to
and relative position of your fuselage to lead’s.

Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_44.jpeg:
Advantages

Line abreast formation provides both aircraft optimum visual
cross-coverage and good position for rapid maneuvering and mutual
support to counter an attack. It diminishes the opportunity for a ground
threat to be alerted by the leader’s overflight and carry out a successful
engagement of the wingman. This formation also makes it easy for the
leader to check the wingman’s position and status.

Disadvantages

If the flight leader does not keep relatively strict formation parameters
(heading and airspeed), he/she forces the wingman to devote excessive
time to maintaining position instead of visual/radar search.

At low altitude, more of the responsibilities of maintaining formation
position shift to the WSO, reducing his/her ability to operate systems and
check six. At very low altitudes, line abreast formation is impractical to
fly because the position of the wingman does not allow adequate terrain
avoidance and maintenance of the assigned formation position.

OPS-4 D - 38


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_45.jpeg:
Two-Ship Wedge

Wingman is 30-70° aft of lead's 3/9 line (Figure D-17) and 4000-9000 feet
out.

This formation provides enhanced maneuverability at the expense of
visual and firepower support for the wingman.

Wingman is in a more flexible position to cover lead’s six.

Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_46.jpeg:
Advantages

The primary advantage of wedge formation is both the leader and
wingman are free to maneuver aggressively. This is an extremely
offensive formation lending itself to a split-plane entry into a visual fight.
The wingman has more flexibility in maintaining position and also has
more time to employ the radar. The formation can be flown at very low
altitudes because the wingman keeps lead in sight, while adequately
scanning approaching terrain.

Disadvantages
A disadvantage of wedge formation is the wingman has little help in
clearing six. There is less flexibility in reacting to attacks aft of the 3-9

line, and, because more time must be devoted to checking six, other
wingman responsibilities may suffer.

Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_47.jpeg:
Two-Ship Fluid Formation

Fluid formation is defined as the wingman positioned within a cone 30° to
70° aft of the leader’s 3/9 line, with lateral spacing normally 1000 to 4000
feet (Figure D-18). Arenas for use include holding in a tactical
environment or maneuvering around obstacles or clouds. This formation
is employed by elements when flying fluid four.

Advantages

This formation allows the element to maintain flight integrity while
holding, under marginal conditions, or in rough terrain.

Disadvantages
A disadvantage of fluid formation is the poor to nonexistent mutual

6 o'clock visual coverage. This formation allows for easy detection by a
single threat.

Tactical Turns

Basic maneuvering requires check turns, delayed 90°, 45° and in-place
180° or cross 180° turns. Turns may be signaled by lead’s turns, wing
flashes or called on the radio. All flight members must maintain a
disciplined visual search.

Check Turn

A check turn is a simultaneous turn by both fighters to a heading 45° or
less from the original heading (Figure D-19). This turns a flight in a
desired direction, or regains line abreast positioning when a specific
heading is not important. A check turn is usually used to signal a turn
when at low altitude below 5000 feet. At medium altitudes, a wing flash
may be used by some flight leads. At medium altitude, after a check turn
in which line abreast positioning is lost, the vertical is used to regain line
abreast. At low altitude, the aircraft in front maneuvers as required to
regain line abreast.

OPS-04-19

Figure D - 19. Check Turn.

OPS-4 D - 42


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_49.jpeg:
Line Abreast Turns

The general contract for line abreast is:
@ The wingman always strives for line abreast.
@ The wingman stays within 90° of lead’s heading.

@ Turns are made in MIL power and airspeed is maintained. Four G
turns at low altitude or buffet onset at medium altitude may be used
for the duration of the turn.

@ All turns are assumed to be 90°.
Delayed Turns

The delayed turn is used to turn a line abreast formation while
maintaining maximum mutual support and lookout. It allows both the
new and old 6:00 areas to be searched. Visual cross-coverage and mutual
support are momentarily degraded as the outside F-15E is crossing in
trail, but are regained when the turn is complete.

The leader initiates the delayed 90° turn using a prebriefed signal,
generally a radio call or a wing flash.

At low altitude, lead may substitute a 30° check turn for the wing flash to
signal turns away from the wingman. The check turn is at 3-4 Gs to
preclude it being mistaken for a belly check or minor navigation
correction. If the turn is into the wingman, lead initiates a 3-4 G turn to
the new heading, the same as at medium altitude. The wingman checks
30° away, maintains heading until lead crosses six, then completes his
turn to roll-out line abreast.

Turns Away From The Wingman: Lead initiates the turn. If check turns
are utilized, lead checks away from the wingman. The wingman turns
into lead (Figure D-21, Left and Right).

For 45° turns, lead turns back into the wingman as the wingman turns
approximately 45°. The wingman rolls out as lead turns into the
wingman. Lead crosses the wingman's flight path and maneuvers to line
abreast and/or the new heading. The wingman then maneuvers to correct
the line abreast formation.

For 90° turns, lead begins when the wingman is pointing at him, or if a
check turn was used when the wingman passes lead’s six.

Lookout Responsibilities During Delayed Turns: These turns allow the

The stabilized fighter checks the new six and the turning fighter checks

the old six. Nevertheless, visual cross coverage and mutual support is
momentarily degraded as the outside F-15E is crossing in trail.

D- 45 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_52.jpeg:
In-Place Turn

A turn away from the wingman does not require a call since lead keeps
turning. Generally, the in-place turn (Figure D-22) is used to quickly turn
a line abreast formation 180°. When the flight lead signals, both aircraft
simultaneously execute a turn at prebriefed parameters (power setting, G-
loading, airspeed) to the desired heading.

A radio call is usually made for a turn into the wingman, otherwise the
wingman would assume a delayed turn. If the turn is to the right, the
aircraft on the right leads the turn for 90°, with the fighter on the left
matching the turn and maintaining proper flight path clearance. At the
90° point, responsibilities switch as relative positions (right and left)
change.

NEW SIX

OLDISIX OPS-04-22

Figure D - 22. In-Place Turns.

In-place turns are also used for other than 180° heading reversals. For
example, they are used to convert to or from a trail/staggered position to
line abreast. If roll-out is to be other than 180°, a radio call is made and
the loss of line abreast positioning at roll-out is to be anticipated.

The primary advantage of an in-place turn is that it gets all aircraft
turned around in minimum time with the proper spacing.

The primary disadvantage is the loss of visual cross-coverage on the
trailing fighter during the turn.

OPS-4 D - 46


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_53.jpeg:
Cross Turn

This turn is another 180° reversal option. The fighters turn into each
other, with altitude split for flight path deconfliction (Figure D-23).
Maneuvering is also out of the horizontal plane to decrease effective turn
radius if the threat arena permits. At low altitude the wingman should
fly above the leader’s flight path.

NEW SIX

OLD SIX

OPS-04-23

Figure D - 23. Cross Turn.

Use of the vertical helps maintain proper spacing on roll-out, but in
general, some sort of follow-on maneuver, such as a check turn or a
shackle, is necessary to regain proper spacing. The formation is
vulnerable after the fighters pass due to the loss of visual cross-coverage
(belly-side) and mutual support potential. In a very low altitude
environment, the cross turn is difficult to perform due to the need for
vertical maneuvering to avoid excessive spacing and prevent collisions. In
all cases, the wingman deconflicts his flight path from the flight leader.

D - 47 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_54.jpeg:
Shackle

This maneuver is used to get the wingman on the required side or to
adjust for excessive spacing. It is often used after 180° turns (especially
cross turns), or to establish a new reference heading (Figure D-24). A
weave is a continuous shackle.

Weaving can be used on egress to help check six and can be prebriefed or
called as the situation dictates.

OPS-04-24

Figure D - 24. Shackle.

Procedures for a shackle:

@ Simultaneous turns by both aircraft toward each other within 30-45° of
reference heading.

@ Cross to maintain mutual support and lookout.
@ Delay turn back momentarily after crossing to obtain proper spacing.
If Number Two is in trail, a weave by lead would mean for Two to

maintain heading while lead restabilizes line abreast. A check turn by
lead with Two in trail would be a signal for an in place 90° turn.

OPS-4 D - 48


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_55.jpeg:
Wedge Turns

Wedge formations are more maneuverable since the wingman generally
has time to react to the leader’s maneuvers. The wingman uses fluid
maneuvering to stay in wedge formation as lead turns (Figure D-25).

A delay is required if the wingman is on the inside of lead’s turn.
Normally, this delay forces the wingman to switch sides.

During turns away, the wingman maneuvers as soon as he perceives a
heading change greater than 40°. When lead turns away from the
wingman and rolls out with the wingman at six, trail formation results.
For example, a 45° check turn away from a wingman in 45° wedge leaves
no maneuver options for the wingman other than to split altitude, or use
power to reposition.

INTO WINGMAN

AWAY FROM WINGMAN

OPS-04-25

Figure D - 25. Turns in Wedge Formation.

Visual search responsibilities during maneuvering require the leader to
check the old six area as lead turns. The wingman clears the new six area
of lead until stabilized on course.

The 180° turns from wedge formation require the wingman to use fluid
maneuvering and reposition in formation on the reciprocal heading.

D - 49 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_56.jpeg:
Formation positions are usually not rigid and the wingman may need to
close up spacing for weather or terrain clearance. If conditions require
rejoining to maintain the formation, wingmen request permission and are
cleared by lead.

Four-Ship Tactical Formation

This basic fighting formation concentrates firepower, increases mutual
support and multiplies options.

The four-ship formation is under control of one flight lead and is employed
as a single entity until forced to separate into two elements. An element
should never sacrifice element integrity attempting to maintain the four-
ship formation. Each two-ship element has its own radar and visual plan
so no changes are required if the four-ship is split into two separate two-
ships.

Visual Search

Each element maintains a visual lookout pattern as described under
two-ship fluid formation. Number Three positions the second element off
the flight leader.

Maneuvering

Number Three maneuvers off the flight lead as if in line abreast, and
usually stays high for deconfliction. Numbers Two and Four maneuver off
their element leaders, as in fluid, to maintain position on the outside of
the formation. Visual responsibilities remain the same. Flight path
deconfliction, especially in altitude, is more critical.

Advantages

Firepower is concentrated. This formation is well-suited for a mission

Disadvantage

This formation tends to be unwieldy and maneuvering is difficult if the
line abreast position is maintained. As a result, inexperienced flight
members spend too much time monitoring and maintaining formation
instead of working the radar, checking six, monitoring RWR, etc. This
formation is not well suited to most CAP missions.

Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_62.jpeg:
Advantages

Concentration of firepower.

The lead element is offensively oriented while the rear element
provides defensive coverage in addition to their offensive potential.

Formation maneuvering potential is good, with element spacing for an
attack built into the formation.

The formation potentially masks the actual number of aircraft from
enemy GCI/AWACS.

Disadvantages

The trail element must devote a significant amount of time to
maintaining visual contact with the lead element. A/A TACAN (if
emission control allows) and/or AAI are useful for the trailing element
to maintain desired spacing.

The trailing element may be momentarily mistaken as a threat. The
trailing element should not lock onto the lead element for ranging
information unless absolutely required, and then should give a “Buddy
Lock” call when this occurs.

Visual Search

Responsibilities are essentially the same as two-ship line abreast.
However, both elements need to remain aware of the other element’s
position.

Maneuvering

The elements use line abreast maneuvering with Number Three
maneuvering off the lead element. The trail element’s proximity aids in
mutual lookout, defensive reaction and coordination during the intercept
phase.

Other Tactical Formations

AFTTP 3-3 explains other tactical formations not covered in this
workbook. They include:

2-3 nm trail. Useful for TFR and FLIR operations.
Arrowhead (a variation of box).

Three-ship VIC, line abreast and trail.

Low Altitude

Fly line abreast at or above 300 feet AGL.

Below 300 feet AGL, wedge is recommended.

Below 1000 feet AGL, wingman (element) is no lower than lead.
Aircraft in front is responsible to get the element back to line abreast.
Crossing steep or hilly terrain, maintain positive G and use no more
than 120° of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1 G is limited to upright

bunting maneuvers.

Maintain a minimum airspeed of 300 KIAS or minimum TF, whichever
is higher.

If ever unable to devote sufficient time to terrain clearance tasks, climb
out of the low altitude structure.

D-57 OPS-4


Text from OPS-4_Formation_Procedures_page_64.jpeg:
Collision Avoidance

@ Collision avoidance is the responsibility of the wingman during
formation maneuvering. Unless directed otherwise by the flight lead,
wingmen maneuver to keep lead in sight and normally deconflict high
and to the outside.

@ There are times when the primary responsibility for deconfliction
transfers to the flight lead.

e When turn geometry forces a wingman to lose visual contact during
formation defensive reaction to a threat

e When a wingman calls “Blind”
e When a wingman calls “Padlocked”

@ Primary responsibility transfers back to the wingman after the
wingman regains a visual on lead. Although tactical formations are
spread generally to allow flexibility of wingman maneuvers, the
differences in responsibilities between the leader and the wingman
demand there be no confusion over roles. Lead changes are usually
made using the radio.

FORMATION INTRODUCTION
Requirement

Formation flying is required for the efficient employment of the F-15E in
the air-to-surface or air-to-air roles. During combat operations, formation
is required for coordinated offensive maneuvering, mutual support and
survivability; therefore, formation discipline is essential.

The Basic Fighting Unit

The basic fighting unit is the two-ship element (Figure D-1). The leader is
responsible for briefing, selecting tactics and employing the flight within
its capabilities to carry out the assigned mission. The wingman's main
duty is to fly the briefed formation and to support the leader at all times.

Approach End Cable Engagement a. Escorted: Extend tail hook. Escorting
aircraft with relay intent.
b. Unescorted: Fly parallel to the active
runway at 1000 feet above the field elevation
with tail hook extended. Rock wings until
reaching the departure end of the runway,
turn to downwind and check tower or mobile
control for light signals. If a straight-in cable
engagement must be flown, flash landing light
on final.

*Bailing Out or Ejection One or both clenched fists pulled downward
across the face to simulate pulling an ejection
face curtain.

Descend to Lower Altitude Hold hand at top of canopy, palm down,
fingers extended and joined, move hand
forward and down.

*Desire to Land Movement of the hand, flat, with palm down,
forward and downward, finishing the
movement in a simulated roundout. As an
alternate signal, lower the landing gear.

Electrical Failure Landing (No Assist Aircraft | Distressed aircraft will fly 500 feet over the

Available) tower or mobile control, then continue to the
far end of the runway and pull up into a wide
downward leg. Proceed with a landing and
pattern approach for the type of aircraft being
flown while watching the tower or mobile for
signals. The control tower will clear the area
of other aircraft and will call emergency crash
equipment to the scene.

I Must Land Immediately Close fist and hold it to top of canopy with
thumb extend downward, then move arm and
down rapidly. (Do not confuse with AGEAR
DOWNG signal, which is generally not used
with altitude.)

I Must Land on Your Wing Pat shoulder, palm down. To prevent
confusion with other signals, use right hand
and left shoulder or vice versa. To
acknowledge, other pilot must give the OK
signal; the basic signal indicates a jet
approach speed of 180 knots. If the distress
aircraft desires a higher approach speed, the
pilot must raise one finger for each 10 knot
increase desired. The distressed aircraft
lands and the escort executes a go around.

Table 2. (Cont=d)

Intercepting Signals The intercepting aircraft positions itself in
front of and usually to the left of the
intercepted aircraft and rocks its wings. This
is a signal that the interceptor wishes the
other aircraft to follow it. A responding
irregular flashing of all available lights in this
case indicates distress.

Radio Failure Tap microphone or earphone of helmet and
signal as appropriate:
a. Receive Failure: With palm of hand over
the ear position, move hand forward and
backward.
b. Transmitter Failure: With palm of hand
toward and in front of the face, move hand up

System Failures (HEFOE System) Clench fist and hold it at top of canopy, then
hold up the required number of fingers to
denote which system is involved (see a
through e below). If the clenched fist signal is
seen but no finger signal is seen or the
intercepting pilot is unable to understand the
signal given, the pilot will assume the aircraft
in distress has one or more systems
inoperable and should proceed with caution.

wing position. This signal indicates a jet
approach speed of 130 knots. If a higher
approach speed is desired, the pilot must
pause after the basic signal, and then blink
flashlight at the top of the canopy, once for
each 10-knot increase desired. The escort
pilot will lead to the nearest suitable field,
declare an emergency with the controlling
agency, then fly a straight-in approach with
the distressed aircraft on the wing. The
distressed aircraft lands and the escort
executes a go around.
NOTE: On a straight-in approach, the escort
aircraft turns the position lights to bright, or
dim and steady as appropriate, to alert the
wingman to prepare to lower flaps and
landing gear. The corresponding signal of
execution will be for the lead aircraft to return
position lights to the original setting.
However, if the aircraft is equipped with only
a steady-bright light position, the lead aircraft
will blink lights for alerting signal of
execution.

Approach End Cable Engagement Fly parallel to active runway at 1000 feet
above field elevation with gear down and flash
landing light. Turn downwind and check
tower or mobile control for light signal. Ifa
straight-in cable engagement must be flown,

Sidelobes

Unfortunately, the antenna cannot focus transmitted RF energy into a
precise beam. Some of this RF energy spills over and is also radiated from
the aircraft. As can be seen from Figure D-3, this energy (called sidelobes)
radiates all around the main beam. RF energy can be received in the
sidelobes and be processed by the receiver as a return. The sidelobe from
the antenna, which spills out directly underneath the aircraft and strikes
the ground, returns to the antenna where it is processed and displayed as
an “altitude line.” Its distance out the radar scope is a rough
approximation of aircraft altitude AGL.

SIDE VIEW TOP VIEW

Generally, sidelobes are not strong enough to interfere with actual returns
although they may mask a weak target return at longer ranges. They do,
however, increase the susceptibility to jamming because they can receive
RF energy transmitted from a jamming source.

Display

The fourth basic component of a radar system is the display. In older
aircraft an actual cathode ray tube (CRT) was used. In new fighters, the
CRT is replaced by a digitized video display that shows a computer
generated display of received radar energy that has been
“smoothed/filtered” by a signal processor. What all of this really means is
that on newer generation radar displays you see a very “clean” display
(i.e., no altitude line, etc.). Two types of displays are usually available:
the plan position indicator (PPI) and the B-scope.

PPI Scope

The PPI displays azimuth, elevation and range information. All objects
(target returns) are displayed in respect to their actual relationship
(azimuth and range) to each other and to the fighter. In most cases, the
PPI display shows only a portion of the area directly in front of the fighter
(+60° off the nose). The display is pie-shaped with the fighter’s position at
the vertex, which equates to zero range (Figure D-4). Range to a target is
measured from the vertex. Target azimuth is measured as an angle from
the centerline, left or right of the nose. Notice that at short range, targets
are displayed in their correct relationship to each other and to the fighter,
but correctly measuring their azimuth is difficult, hence the PPI scope is
more suited to ground mapping where close-in display is not critical.

B-Scope

The second type of display is the B-scope. It is rectangular in shape and
measures range in the vertical axis, where distance increases from the
bottom of the display. Azimuth is measured as a distance horizontally
from the centerline (as opposed to the PPI display where an actual angle
is used to measure azimuth). This type of display decreases the problem
of identifying two different targets at close range, but does cause
distortion. The B-scope can be thought of as a PPI-scope with the bottom
stretched out as shown in Figure D-5. The B-scope is commonly used for
air-to-air applications.

SCAN PATTERNS

Due to the narrow main beam of radar energy used on fighter aircraft,
detecting a target can be a real challenge (akin to looking for a target
through a soda straw). To enhance the ability to detect a target, various
methods are used to increase areas of coverage. Azimuth coverage is
enhanced by sweeping the antenna side-to-side (and hence, the radar
beam) to provide a wide angular coverage (+60°) off the fighter’s nose.
Other methods are used to increase antenna coverage in altitude: conical
scan, raster scan and track-while-scan.

Conical Scan

A narrow beam’s detection capability can be increased to provide
additional altitude coverage by offsetting the radar antenna feedhorn and
rotating the antenna in a circular pattern. This concept is called nutation
and has two effects: (1) increased antenna coverage in altitude (Figure
D-6) and (2) with some additions to the radar system, the ability to more
precisely track a target in azimuth and elevation.

Text from RDR-1_Radar_Introduction_page_14.jpeg:
Raster Scan

A raster scan (Figure D-7) uses a thin beam to cover a rectangular area by
horizontally sweeping the area while incrementally stepping up or down
the elevation angle with each horizontal sweep of the sector. The
elevation angle is reset to the original value after the sector is covered and
the process repeats.

BAR equals basic antenna raster. One horizontal (sometimes vertical)
sweep is called one BAR. Figure D-7 is displaying six BARS of sweep,
each at different elevations. The complete sweep pattern (six BARS in
this example) is called the frame. Frame time is the total time to sweep
the frame and return to the starting place.

Text from RDR-1_Radar_Introduction_page_15.jpeg:
Track-While-Scan (TWS)

Pure search radar modes display the targets detected on each scan. The
range, doppler and angle for each detected target may also be displayed or
available. Each antenna scan is independent of all others. No effort is
made to decide if a detection on one scan is of the same target as a
detection on a previous scan or if it is a detection of a new target.

On the other hand, track-while-scan (Figure D-8) combines search and
track features. The antenna scans a raster pattern (frame) similar to the
search pattern discussed earlier. However, unlike the search mode, the
radar computer decides automatically whether a detection belongs to a
target that was seen on a previous scan or if it belongs to a new target.
This means that sequential detections from the same target are processed
into measurements similar to a single target tracking mode and are
filtered to estimate the target’s position, velocity and acceleration. This
data composes part of what is called the target’s track file. TWS is
described more completely in later lessons.

PULSED RADARS

Radio frequency energy has several properties that must be understood to
grasp basic radar theory. Pulsed radars operate in the time domain and
are excellent at measuring range on all aspect targets at medium and
short range but are poor at long range or in look-down situations.

Propagation

Radar energy travels through the atmosphere in a straight line at the
speed of light, (i.e., cannot “see” through terrain or over the horizon), and
the amount of radar energy returned (or reflected) to the source radar is
influenced by the reflectivity of the object it strikes.

Radar energy travels at 162,000 nm/sec. For this energy to traverse 1 nm
takes 6.2 usec (usec = microsecond or 1/1,000,000 of a second). Since radar
energy must make a two-way trip it actually takes 12.4 usec to travel a
radar mile (1 nm out and 1 nm back). Another way to express how fast
radar waves travel is to say that RF energy goes approximately 984 feet in
1 usec.

The amount of radar energy coming back to the source radar is a function
of the target’s reflectivity. A target’s reflectivity is simply the term used
to describe the power that is reflected or scattered by the target. The
reflectivity of a target is determined by:

aspect

size

material

shape
engine/blade rpm

Anatomy of a Pulse

A radar pulse is defined by the amount of time the transmitter is turned
on. The transmitter must then shut down to allow the antenna to listen
for reflected energy. This ON/OFF cycle repeats many times a second.
The number of pulses present during the cycle (pulses per second) is
known as the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and is measured in hertz
(Hz) or cycles per second. Two successive pulses from a radar transmitter
are shown in Figure D-12. The time the transmitter is actually
transmitting (ON) defines the pulse width (PW). The time from the
beginning of one pulse to the beginning of the next pulse is called the
pulse repetition interval (PRI). The time from the end of the pulse
recovery time (RT) to the beginning of the dead time (DT) is known as the
actual listening time.

Maximum Range

Maximum range is dependent on listening time. Some of the possible
listening time is unavailable during the time the antenna is transferring
from transmit to receive functions and again when it changes from the
receive to the transmit mode. These unavailable times are referred to as
recovery time and dead time, respectively. Maximum practical detection
range (in nm) is then:

Actual Listening Time (usec)

12.4 (usec/nm)

Minimum Range

The recovery time immediately following transmission depends on the
design of the radar. Since the radar cannot see a target while it is either
transmitting or recovering, the minimum theoretical range depends on
these two times. The inability of a radar to process a return during these
times is referred to as eclipsing. For example, given a PW of 5.2 usec and
a recovery time of 1.0 usec, the total time that the radar cannot receive is
6.2 usec. Using 984 as the distance radar energy travels in 1 usec,
minimum range can be determined by the formula:

(PW + RT) x 984
—_—_—__—_—— = Minimum Range
2 (two-way trip)

Minimum range for the above example is determined by:

(5.2 + 1.0) x 984
2

= 3050.4

Therefore, in this example, a target must be more than 3050.4 feet away
to be seen.

Range Ambiguity

Ambiguous returns are associated with pulsed radars. As shown in
Figure D-13, ambiguity occurs when the reflected energy comes back in a
pulse listening period other than the one from which it was transmitted.
The radar sees the return but does not correlate it to the corresponding
transmitted pulse. This is called range ambiguity. Range is displayed in
relation to the immediately preceding pulse, which makes range
computation incorrect. In other words, the returned energy from pulse
one may be displayed at a range that equates to a return from pulse two
(Figure D-13). There is a maximum range measurement limitation in any
pulse radar and it is PRF dependent. This range is referred to as
maximum unambiguous range for a particular PRF. Low PRFs have a
long range measuring capability before ambiguity occurs. High PRFs
have a very short range measuring capability before ambiguity occurs.
Other more sophisticated ranging methods have been devised to overcome
range ambiguity.

Position Determination
Merely detecting a target is insufficient. Once you determine that a target

exists, you must then determine its position relative to you in range and
azimuth.

Text from RDR-1_Radar_Introduction_page_24.jpeg:
Determining Target Range

Remember that your radar uses a single antenna for both transmission
and reception of energy. This allows a ranging method using high energy
pulses. Range is determined by transmitting a small burst of energy and
measuring the time necessary for the energy to travel to the target and
return to the receiver. Distance can be computed directly.

As already stated, radar energy travels at the speed of light and since it
must make a two-way trip in detecting a target, it takes 12.4 usec to
travel 1 nm. Hence, range to the target can be found by dividing the time
difference between transmitted and received pulses by 12.4. The formula
for this is shown as:

Time Between Transmit and Receive (usec)
Target Range (nm) = —<§_ —---A
12.4 (usec/nm)

In a typical long range search radar, the transmitted pulse has a duration
of about 5 usec. RF energy travels at the speed of light (984 feet/usec) so
the leading edge of the pulse is about 4900 feet from the antenna when
the transmitter shuts off and the receiver begins listening for echo
returns. Therefore, as shown in Figure D-14, the incident pulse has a
length of 4900 feet.

The entire reflected pulse would travel back toward the receiver at the
speed of light, making the trip in another 62 usec (Figure D-16). It takes
124 usec for the pulse to complete a round trip from the antenna to the
target and back. Therefore, target range would be

124 usec
————— = 10nm

Determining Target Azimuth

The target’s azimuth could be determined by pointing a stationary narrow
beam at the target. If the beam width was 1° and an echo was displayed
on the scope, you would know the target azimuth within 1°. This is not,
however, a practical solution to azimuth determination because all targets
outside of the 1° beam width would go undetected by radar.

Continuously rotating the antenna through a full 360° (or portion thereof)

Text from RDR-1_Radar_Introduction_page_27.jpeg:
As the antenna rotates in a clockwise direction, it will eventually reach an
angular area wherein several consecutive transmitted pulses are reflected
by the target back to the antenna (Figure D-17). In this instance each of
these pulses will complete the round trip in 124 usec and generate a
bright spot on the display. The position of the spot will correspond to the
range and azimuth of the target.

Azimuth ambiguity of some returns is the result of the width of the beam
and the distance of the object. A 1° beam is only 17-1/2 feet wide at 1000
feet from the antenna. At 20 nm from the antenna, that same 1° spreads
to include over 2000 feet as shown in Figure D-18. In other words, there
may be two bogeys out there even though you can only see one.

Text from RDR-1_Radar_Introduction_page_28.jpeg:
Resolution

When a pulse radar operates, each transmitted pulse has some physical
properties that cause problems in resolving azimuth and range.

Azimuth Resolution

The ability to differentiate targets in azimuth depends on the width of the
beam at the target range. The larger the beam width, and the greater the
range, the more area the beam covers. From trigonometry you know that
the length of an arc of 1° at a distance of 60 nm covers 1 nm (or 6000 feet).
This is also known as the 1-in-60 rule. From this you can see that a radar
with a 1° beam width covers 6000 feet at a distance of 60 nm. With this 1°
beam width radar, two targets at a range of 60 nm would have to be at
least 6000 feet apart to show as separate targets. As range decreases, less
distance between the targets is required to display as separate targets (at
20 nm, 1° = 2000 feet; at 30 nm, 1° = 3000 feet etc). Figure D-18 shows
that at 20 nm, two F-15Es flying with a 1500-foot wingtip spread appear
as a single contact to a 1° beam width radar.

Multiple targets must be separated by at least the width of the beam at

separated from target C by 2400 feet.

At a range of 30 nm the width of the beam covers all three targets
simultaneously and only one target is displayed on the radar scope. As
range decreases to 20 nm the beam covers both target A and B, but as the
trailing edge of the beam leaves target B, the leading edge of the beam
has not yet arrived at target C. As the leading edge strikes target C, the
trailing edge has left target B and thus the radar displays two targets.
The radar would not be able to differentiate three separate targets until
range decreases to less than 6 nm.

Range Resolution

Since a pulse of radar energy has a physical length, multiple targets at
different ranges also present resolution problems. In this case, however,
the ability to resolve targets is only a function of the pulse length (PL). As
a pulse of radar energy strikes a target, the leading edge of the pulse
begins to reflect back to the sending radar. As long as two targets are
separated in range by more than 1/2 the PL, they will resolve into two
distinct targets. For a 1 usec pulse width, two targets must be separated
by 500 feet in range to show as distinct targets.

Resolution Cell
If both azimuth resolution and range resolution are considered, a

resolution cell (volume) may be constructed (Figure D-20) with boundaries
defined by beam width at target range and by half the PL.

Pulse Spectrum/Clutter Theory

One problem associated with pulse radars is that radar energy is not only
reflected from targets of interest, but from other objects, including the
earth's surface. Sometimes these unwanted returns are referred to as
noise. Some noise is internal to the radar set due to leakage of RF energy.
Some noise comes from energy returned in the antenna sidelobes and
some noise results from main beam contact with the ground.
Unfortunately, some of this noise masks true target returns. Figure D-21
depicts an airborne pulse radar with the main beam striking the ground
at some range. At all the points where sidelobes strike the ground, energy
is reflected back to the radar (ground return). These returns show up on
the radar display as an altitude line, sidelobe clutter and main beam
returns, which may be stronger than other target returns. Sidelobe
clutter (SLC) is all types of sidelobe energy clutter on the radar display
that interfere with the true target return. Main beam clutter (MBC) is
clutter on the radar display that comes from main beam contact with the
surface (ground return).

If the amplitude of returns is graphed as a function of range, as shown in
Figure D-22, it can be seen that target amplitude must exceed MBC and
SLC to be seen. Hence, target B will not be seen, while target A will show
on the radar as a target. This happens because target A has a higher
amplitude than the sidelobe clutter at the same range. A disadvantage of
pulse radar is poor look-down capability because main beam clutter from
ground returns mask real target returns.

DOPPLER RADARS

Doppler radars exploit frequency changes of the transmitted radar signal.
Doppler radars operate in the frequency domain (compared to the time
domain for pulse radars) and are excellent at detecting front aspect
targets even in look-down situations. They are poor for accurate range
measurement.

Doppler Shift

A pure doppler radar uses a continuous wave (CW) of radio frequency
energy with the transmitter turned ON and left ON (as opposed to a
pulsed wave where the transmitter goes through an ON/OFF cycle). A
pure CW radar uses two antennas: one for transmitting and another for
receiving. No timing scheme is used in this CW operation; however, small
changes in frequency can readily be seen. This change in frequency is
called doppler shift.

In essence, doppler shift occurs due to the closing (or opening) velocity of a
target in respect to the transmitter. If the transmitter is stationary and
sends out a radar signal at a fixed frequency, it is reflected from other
objects.

D-27 RDR-1


Text from RDR-1_Radar_Introduction_page_34.jpeg:
If this signal is reflected back from another stationary object, the received
signal is at the same frequency as the transmitted signal. If the second
object is moving toward the transmitter, the object reflects and
“compresses” the wavefront of the CW signal. This compression of the
wavefront causes the transmitted signal to come back at a higher
frequency. Conversely, an object moving away from the transmitter
“stretches” the wavefront and the signal returns at a lower frequency.
This shift of the transmitted frequency is the doppler shift (see Figure
D-23). Knowing that the frequency is shifted higher tells us that the
target is moving toward us; by knowing how much the frequency is
shifted, we can calculate the target's velocity using the factor 1 KHz =
30 knots.

Figure D - 23. Doppler Shift.

Obviously the same phenomenon applies to an airborne radar versus a
stationary radar. However, in the case of an airborne doppler radar, the
host radar is moving and stationary targets appear at a frequency shift
equal to the fighter’s velocity. In other words, all closure is due to the
fighter's speed. Additionally, targets with no frequency shift would be
those going directly away at the same speed as the host radar.

Doppler Spectrum/Clutter Theory

Just as the pulse radar receives returns from the main beam and
sidelobes, so does a doppler radar. However, in a doppler radar, the
effects of ground clutter are different. The line across the center of the
chart depicted in Figure D-24 represents velocity.

Text from RDR-1_Radar_Introduction_page_36.jpeg:
The same axioms that were examined in pulse radar clutter can be
derived from the chart. However, the altitude line, sidelobe clutter and
main beam clutter appear at positions relating to a certain velocity
(frequency shift), rather than range. The altitude line is at the same place
that a return from a target with no opening or closing velocity would
appear. Any targets being overtaken at a speed greater than zero from
the stern would appear in the sidelobe clutter region. A beam target is
competing with the main beam clutter since the doppler shift from both is
equal to the groundspeed of the fighter. Doppler radars usually lose
targets that move into main beam clutter. Targets that are head-on or
front-aspect appear in the clear region beyond main beam clutter; doppler
radars are optimized to detect these targets.

FM Doppler Ranging

As has been pointed out, CW radars cannot provide range information;
but, there is a technique that allows range estimation by modulating the
radar frequency. This technique is called frequency modulated ranging
(FM ranging or FM ramping). Transmitting a constant frequency for a
short period of time, then changing the frequency (ramping) for a short
period of time, and then returning to the original frequency produces the
effect of short bursts of “coded” frequencies. As the signal returns it is
possible to correlate a returned signal to its codified (ramped) transmit
frequency. This allows the radar to use a timing system and provide a
range estimation on a target (see Figure D-25).

Text from RDR-1_Radar_Introduction_page_37.jpeg:
Pulsed Doppler

Some fighters utilize a “pulsed doppler” radar. This system combines both
the characteristics of a pulse radar and a doppler radar by transmitting
bursts (or pulses) and measuring the return from a target utilizing both
the time and the velocity domains. In other words, it uses timing of pulses
for ranging and doppler for velocity. This is accomplished by transmitting
at a very high PRF, which can be thought of as “near” continuous wave
(Figure D-26). By combining both pulse and doppler techniques these
radars take advantage of both long-range detection of front-aspect targets
(even in a look-down environment) and accurate range measurement on
all aspect targets. A pulse doppler radar is essentially an all-aspect
doppler radar.

TARGET TRACKING

The two major functions of fighter radars are searching and tracking. The
process of searching finds the target and has been discussed. Tracking is
used to gain more information on the target (e.g., heading, airspeed,
altitude, etc.); but, more importantly, tracking allows the aircrew to focus
on a primary target for air-to-air weapons delivery. This section deals
with various methods used to track a target: range/velocity tracking,
conical scan, monopulse and phase comparison monopulse.

Range/Velocity Tracking

After target returns come back to the receiver they are sent to the
processor. Range information is obtained by timing. Target returns are
then placed in range bins (i.e., a “storage” bin that’s size is determined by
pulse width). The operator signifies the desire to track a target by
manipulating some radar display symbol at the target location (i.e.,
acquisition symbols). This action identifies a specific return in the range
bins and “gates” it. As the return changes range, the gate moves along
with it and “tracks” the identified target. As range changes over time, a
rate of change is computed and displayed as overtake (Vc).

Velocity trackers work in much the same manner by using frequency (or
velocity) bins to identify a specific target. It is then tracked using a
velocity gate. No calculation is required to compute overtake since
velocity is already known from doppler shift.

Angle Tracking
It is necessary to track a target in azimuth and elevation to keep the

fighter’s radar pointed at the target, especially for certain types of
air-to-air missiles (i.e., the AIM-7).

RDR-1 D - 32


Text from RDR-1_Radar_Introduction_page_39.jpeg:
Conical Scan Tracker

As previously stated, a conical scan (conscan) pattern is the result of
offsetting the antenna feedhorn and rotating the assembly. Altitude
coverage is increased, but also an overlapping pattern in the center of the
conscan pattern is developed. The radar measures the amplitude in each
of the scanned quadrants as shown in Figure D-27.

Text from RDR-1_Radar_Introduction_page_40.jpeg:
When the antenna boresight is pointed at the target the amplitude of the
return is equal in all quadrants. If the target moves in azimuth/elevation,
then the amplitude will be higher in one quadrant and lower in others.
This action generates an error signal that results in the antenna slewing
back over the target and thus equalizing the amplitude in each of the
quadrants. Note that the illustration depicts only four quadrants; in
reality there are many quadrants as the antenna scans the target.

Monopulse Tracker

Monopulse trackers get azimuth, elevation, range and velocity information
from each single pulse (hence monopulse) of returned energy. Azimuth
and elevation errors are generated to equalize the sum of the quadrants as
shown in Figure D-28.

AZIMUTH ERROR = (A + C) - (B + D)

A phase comparison monopulse antenna uses a hybrid monopulse
technique. Azimuth, elevation, and range, as well as doppler information
are received from a single pulse of returned energy. A sum/difference is
computed for azimuth and elevation tracking. Additionally, the wave
front of returned energy is checked for phase angle (6) difference. Ifa
phase difference is found, an error signal is generated to reorient the
antenna in azimuth/elevation (Figure D-29).

Figure D-1 depicts the relationship of these basic functional components.
Transmitter
The transmitter generates a high powered radio frequency (RF) signal
that is radiated by the antenna. This signal is generated by a high-power

magnetron oscillator. The details of transmitter function are not essential

remember detailed information regarding the receiver. Remember that
the receiver listens for the echoes of the waves previously transmitted by
the antenna.

Both the transmitter and receiver share a common antenna. Since only
one antenna is used, it is important to note that the radar cannot send
signals out (from the transmitter) and receive signals back (to the
receiver) at the same time. It must be either a transmitter or a receiver.
Additionally, the antenna must focus the RF energy into a narrow beam to
aid in azimuth and elevation determination of detected airborne targets.

RDR-1 D-2


Text from RDR-1_Radar_Introduction_page_9.jpeg:
Main Beam

The narrow beam of energy, which is transmitted along the centerline of
the antenna, is referred to as the main beam. It is defined by the points
where the transmitted power drops from maximum strength (along the
centerline) to one-half power (known as the half power points). The size of
the main beam is called the beam width and is measured in degrees (see
Figure D-2). The narrower the beam the more accurate the azimuth and
elevation measurements of the radar. Note that the antenna is swept
side-to-side in a 120° pattern (or portions thereof) to measure azimuth,
which is referenced to the fighter’s nose.

Removes all power from the radar.

Initiates a three-minute warm-up period. A radar BIT is
performed during power up. At the end of that period, all
radar functions are operational except for transmitter high
voltage and RF transmissions. AIM-120 missile BIT is
performed (does not BIT training PACS missiles).

Full radar operation except on the ground (weight on
wheels [WOW] switch engaged). TUNE appears on the
MPD/MPCD until all AIM-7 missiles tune or the
120-second timer expires, whichever occurs first. If the
operator bypasses the STBY position, radar operation is
inhibited until the three-minute warm-up timer expires.

This position provides full radar operation. It bypasses all
protective interlocks, except the WOW switch, the
transmitter coolant flow interlocks and the three-minute
warm-up timer. Activation requires pulling the switch out
and rotating it to EMERG. Going to EMERG sets a white
flag to the right of the switch that requires maintenance
action to reset.

NOTE

Use of EMERG is not authorized for peacetime training missions.

MPD/MPCD Controls

As with any MPD/MPCD, you cannot control the display unless you are
‘in command” of that display. Display of “in command” lines on the
bottom of the MPD/MPCD and solid acq symbols indicate system control.
A “system in use” message indicates the other crew member is moving the
acq symbols or has locked-up/designated a target.

Elevation (EL) Scan Control

PB #2 controls the number of elevation bars (Figure D-4/D-5) that the
antenna covers during its raster search pattern. The bars have 1° spacing
in 40, 80 and 160 nm ranges. They have 2-1/2° spacing in 20 nm and 3.4°
spacing in 10 nm ranges. In TWS, elevation bar spacing is always 1.5°.
Current bar sweep (e.g., 3 for third) and PRF (HI or MED) appear on the
lower left corner of the display.

Frame Store (FS)

PB #8 (Figure D-5) specifies the number of old frames that a target
continues to appear on the screen. With frame store set at 3, a fast
moving target might appear as three old targets in trail, reduced in
intensity, along with the brightest current frame target. If displayed on
the MPCD, the most recent hit is white, the next blue and the last green.
Track-while-scan (TWS) frame store is automatically set at one.

Ground Moving Target Rejection (GMTR)

PB #4 (Figure D-5) allows selection of a 45 to 95 knot filter around main
beam clutter in medium PRF (i.e., RWS-M). LO provides +45 knots of
moving target rejection as long as the antenna elevation is less than +3°
lookup. (For angles greater than +3° look up, clutter rejection is + 10
knots with GMTR LO selected.) GMTR MED provides +63 knots of target
rejection, and GMTR HI provides +87 knots of rejection. Each setting
successively reduces the possibility of ground moving targets causing
unwanted returns on the display. GMTR CHAF selects a special MPRF
mechanization, which provides 95 knots of GMT rejection and an airborne
beam notch of +95 knots.

The RGH mode at PB #7 (Figure D-7) employs an intermediate PRF
between MPRF and HPRF and allows detection of both front and tail
aspect targets with good ranging accuracy and sorting capability. It
reverts back to INLV when aircraft altitude is less than 4000 feet AGL.
RGH is boxed when selected.

VS

Pressing PB #8 (Figure D-7) selects VS (velocity search), a pure doppler
HPRF mode. There is no ranging available in this mode and the display
format is azimuth and velocity. With VS selected (boxed), pressing PB #8
again brings up and boxes VCTR (vector scan). Vector scan also uses
HPRF, but with FM ranging. The VCTR display format is azimuth and
range. VCTR changes the antenna scan rate to facilitate detecting small
radar cross section (RCS) targets.

ENTER

Enter at PB #10 (Figure D-8) presets certain air-to-air search parameters
based on MRM or SRM selection. To use this feature, first select MRM or
SRM at the weapon select switch, and then choose the parameters you
desire for that mode. Selectable radar parameters are bar scan, range and
radar mode (e.g., INLV). After selecting the desired radar parameters,
press ENTER. Selecting MRM or SRM on the weapon select switch
(forward or aft on RCP castle switch) will initialize the radar to those
specific parameters. Other radar parameters such as frame store,
azimuth and GMTR are not programmable with PB #10, but will be as
last selected. The MC/DTM may also be used to program radar
parameters.

FLOOD

Selecting Flood at PB #13 (Figure D-8) is a MPRF ranging only mode that
provides gun LCOS track funnel ranging out to 2 nm as long as the target
is maintained in the flood antenna beam (16° wide/40° vertical, centered
on W). Other flood modes will be covered in subsequent lessons.

Acquisition (Acq) Symbol

The acq symbol is a pair of vertical lines with space between them (Figure
D-10). The crew member moves the acq symbol with the TDC; the acq
symbol is used to position the lock-on gate (volume) on the radar display
or to sample/highlight targets in search/TWS. Manual lock on is obtained
by placing the acq symbol over the target and depressing and releasing
the FCP TDC or the RCP trigger. This lock on is called single target track
(STT).

D-11 RDR-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_18.jpeg:
The acquisition symbol is available during STT when medium range
missile (MRM) is selected on the weapon select switch. The acquisition
symbol is not available in STT when short range missile (SRM) or gun is
selected on the weapon select switch.

Besides using the acq symbol for lock on, the crew member can use the acq
symbol to command azimuth or range “bumping.” Bumping the side of the
display changes the azimuth scan between 60° and 120° (azimuth
bumping not available in STT). Bumping the top of the screen changes to
the next higher range. Bumping the bottom changes to the next lower
range. Range bumping is available in STT; however, once range bumping
is used, automatic range scale change is no longer available (auto range
scale change will return when MRM is deselected in STT). Also, once in
STT with MRM selected, the CC will not honor a range bump to a range
scale smaller than the STT target’s current range.

A slow/fast cue (target speed greater than or equal to 1.1 Mach, or less
than or equal to 0.4 Mach) will appear to the right of the target in STT or
to the right of the acquisition symbol when the target is sampled with the
acq symbol in TWS. Acquisition symbol sampling of the target will also
recall NCTR data.

C Altitude Searching

The two numbers shown to the right of the acquisition symbol
indicate the altitude block being searched. The altitude block
numbers represent the coverage at the range of the acq symbol. The
numbers represent the top and bottom of the coverage in thousands
of feet MSL. Altitude coverage circles are also displayed on the left
edge of the grid for a graphic depiction of the top and bottom of the
elevation coverage. The center of the scale (0° or level) corresponds to
0 feet. The top of the scale (60°) corresponds to 60,000 feet. When
the acq symbol is placed over a target in search, a digital MSL
altitude is displayed left of the acq symbol and an altitude "coffin"
appears within the altitude coverage circles, both more precisely
defining the target's altitude.

D_ Range Displayed

The range of the display (10, 20, 40, 80 or 160 nm) appears at the top
right corner. The inscribed lines represent 25%, 50% and 75% of the
total range.

on the air-to-air radar display in search if it is within the radar sweep
area. If a destination symbol and the bullseye point are at the same
location, then both will be displayed and super-imposed. A digital
readout of bearing and range from the bullseye point (whether
symbol is on A/A radar display or not) to either the STT target or acq
symbol (if not in STT) is shown to the right of the F-15E ground speed
readout on the A/A radar display. Bullseye data may be blanked in
some radar modes (e.g., Flood).

I Display of Bearing, Range and Altitude (BRA)

In addition to existing altitude information (coffin in search or digital
altitude readout in search and track), bearing and range information
from the F-15E to the acquisition symbol/tracked target is available
to the aircrew. This information is a digital readout in the upper left
corner of the A/A radar display (to the left of channel-band selection).
Bearing is above range and is in degrees (5 degree increments)
relative to Magnetic North, with leading zeroes. Range is in one
nautical mile increments without leading zeroes.

HOTAS Controls
FCP Stick

The auto acquisition switch (Figure D-16) is the only switch on the FCP
stick that controls the radar. It is spring loaded to center and has three
other positions: forward, aft and down. From radar search, the switch
commands radar auto acquisition supersearch (SS), boresight (BST), long
range boresight (LR BST) and vertical scan (VTS). When in search, the
down position (mode reject or return to search (RTS)) can be used to clear
the radar display (erase the targets). In radar track, the switch
commands TWS variations. Forward selects high data TWS (HD-TWS)
and aft selects normal TWS (N-TWS). In TWS, forward alternately cycles
(toggles) HD-TWS/N-TWS. Aft from any TWS mode toggles STT/N-TWS.

Elevation (EL) Wheel

The elevation wheel is a spring-centered, round switch located on the left
side of the left throttle. The wheel allows control of the vertical pointing
angle (space stabilized relative to INS horizon) of the radar antenna in
search. Moving the wheel from center causes the radar antenna vertical
angle to move up or down. The farther the switch is held from center, the
faster the antenna vertical angle changes. Rotating the front of the wheel
upward causes the radar antenna to move upward. Down on the wheel
moves the antenna downward. Since radar elevation coverage is
determined by the vertical pointing angle of the antenna, the control
switch is called the elevation wheel instead of some other name. Vertical
pointing angle remains centered on the target upon exit from STT or TWS
back to search. However, the vertical pointing angle is initialized to zero
(INS horizon) upon exit from SS, BST, LR BST or VTS search patterns to
normal search patterns by RTS (mode reject). During GUNS auto acq
search pattern, mode reject will return the scan pattern to the INS
horizon centerline.

D-19 RDR-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_26.jpeg:
TDC

The TDC positions the acquisition symbol on the radar display. The acq
symbol moves in the same direction as the TDC moves. Depressing and
releasing the TDC commands target lockon from search (FCP only).
Depressing the TDC for greater than one second commands the narrow
azimuth scan sort mode from search or track. The TDC also positions the
radar's scan center in either supersearch or gun mode. If in radar search
with less than full gimbal azimuth sweep, the TDC will adjust the sweep
center left and right (the sweep center is centered on the acq symbol).

Coolie Switch

This switch (Figure D-17) is at the right front corner of the right throttle.
In addition to the spring loaded neutral position, it has the following four

positions:

UP

DOWN
INBOARD

OUTBOARD

RDR-2

This quick steps (moves) from one designated TWS
target to the next (other TWS actions covered later).
If gun is selected and a radar lock is achieved, it
cycles between GDS and GDS funnel modes. It
selects highlight and combined modes.

This is a missile boresight/gunsight stiffen position.
This activates the EID/EWWS/NCTR.

This activates the AAI.

Castle Switch

In addition to a spring-loaded neutral position (off), this switch has
five-positions: left, right, forward, aft and down.

LEFT Undesignates a track-while-scan target.

RIGHT Rejects the missile currently selected.

FORWARD Initiates LRS (MRM) programmed radar search
parameters/mode.

AFT Initiates SRS (SRM) programmed radar search
parameters/mode.

DOWN Quick steps from one TWS designated target to
another (other TWS actions covered later). Selects
highlight mode.

TDC

This controls the acquisition symbol, just like the FCP TDC. When used
with half action on the trigger, it controls the elevation coverage of the
radar by adjusting the antenna vertical pointing angle.

Interrogate Switch

This is a three-position button on the outboard side of the right hand
controller (Figure D-19) spring loaded to the center-off position. It
activates AAI when moved forward, and EID/EWWS/NCTR functions
when moved aft.

Countermeasures Dispenser (CMD) Switch

The CMD switch is located on the outboard side of the left hand controller
(Figure D-20). Forward starts the Manual 1 program and aft starts the
Manual 2 program. The switch is spring loaded to the center (off)
position.

Coolie Switch

This switch scrolls and takes command of the displays in the RCP.

Auto Acquisition

Pressing down on the auto acq button returns the radar to search.
Antenna elevation remains that of the target from STT and TWS. Auto
acq forward or aft for less than 1 second may be used to return the
antenna vertical pointing angle to the INS horizon (elevation caret to zero)
and the azimuth to centerline. All other positions control specific track
functions. The radar auto acquisition modes cannot be commanded from
the rear cockpit. When in search, the down position (mode reject) clears
the radar display (erases the targets or birds). TWS functions are
identical to those described for the front cockpit auto acquisition button.

F-15E BIT CHECKS
Initiated BIT (I-BIT) Checks

Normally, the aircrew should accomplish an I-BIT (with track test) on the
radar before every flight. After the I-BIT, the aircrew will be fully aware
of radar system status and its capabilities. If the radar does not work
properly in flight, include the results of an airborne

I-BIT in the maintenance write up.

Procedures to start an I-BIT on the ground or airborne are displayed in
Figure D-23. The radar power knob must be in STBY or ON with the
radar warmed up. Display the radar on a separate MPD/MPCD. When
the radar is warmed up, the azimuth caret will ~ sweeping.

ensure the integrity of the WOW switch. I-BIT is started as mentioned in
Figure D-23. The aircrew BIT matrix will be displayed on the radar
display. If GND appears at the bottom right of the aircrew BIT matrix
display (Figure D-24), the aircrew can be confident that the radar will not
transmit while on the ground when the radar power is turned on.

The aircrew BIT matrix remains displayed until you proceed to the
maintenance BIT matrix, or until you reject it by pressing down on the
auto acq switch.

The aircrew BIT matrix (Figure D-24) lists those radar functions that
failed the BIT and shows any RF channels that are bad. The

After the STBY I-BIT matrix pages have been checked, place the radar
power knob to ON, wait for the AIM-7 tune cycle to finish and the radar
display to begin azimuth sweeping. At this point, start another I-BIT.
SELECT OPTION appears after starting the radar I-BIT (Figure D-26).
Moving the auto acq switch forward or aft once starts the radar’s track
test. Failure to select track test during the time SELECT OPTION is
displayed allows the radar to continue the initiated BIT without a track
test.

During track test, check the radar's tracking functions. You should lock
on to both medium and high PRF targets to check out the tracking
circuits. Also check manual and auto acquisition modes.

The I-BIT takes approximately 90 seconds by itself. The track test may be
maintained as long as desired, and when terminated, the I-BIT continues
to completion. Normally, all of the radar BIT procedures can be
accomplished in 3-4 minutes.

F-15E RADAR SEARCH MODES

During radar surveillance, there are three operational phases: detection,
acquisition and tracking. In the search or detection phase, the
fundamental concern is optimizing radar parameters to detect both long
and short range targets. Common terms for these conditions are long
range search (LRS) and short range search (SRS). These are also referred
to as MRM search and SRM search. By presetting the APG-70 radar,
detection sensitivity to long range, front aspect target detection is
optimized. Likewise, in the SRS, detection capability is optimized by
presetting the radar mode for short range maneuvering targets.

PB #6 on the MPD selects the LRS or SRS radar modes normally used.
These are INLV and MED. These RWS modes can be preset to coincide
with the selection of either MRM or SRM on the weapon select switch.
For example, normally the aircrew programs the radar to initialize in
MED when selecting SRM or INLV when selecting MRM. Once
programmed by the aircrew (or MC/DTM), LRS or SRS parameters can
also be selected by toggling the RCP castle switch forward (LRS) or aft
(SRS) while in command of the A/A radar display.

Long Range Search Mode (Primary)

Range While Search-Interleaved (INLV)

During normal LRS conditions, INLV is the basic air-to-air surveillance
mode. In INLV the radar operates in an interleaved (alternating high and
medium) PRF. For example, the first bar of the radar's transmission is
high PRF (radar bit window reads “HI”) and the second bar is medium
PRF (radar bit window reads “MED”). Alternating PRF maximizes target
detection capabilities under most tactical conditions. In other words,
interleaved gives maximum capability to detect front aspect targets at
long range and all-aspect targets at short range.

Although INLV is normally high and medium interleaved PRF, the radar
employs only MPRF (radar bit window reads “MED”) waveform with

10 nm range selected. With 160 mile range selected, the radar employs
either HPRF (radar BIT window reads “HA”) or interleaved PRF
waveform (radar BIT window alternates “HI” and “MED”), selectable by
alternate acq symbol range bumps against the top of the A/A radar
display.

D- 35 RDR-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_42.jpeg:
Advantages

Interleaved combines the advantages of both high and medium PRF. It
gives the capability to detect long range high aspect targets. It also gives
the capability to detect all-aspect short range targets.

Disadvantages

INLV is a poor sort mode. Because of the different methods used to
determine range (either HPRF or MPRF), it is possible to see different
ranges for the same target.

Limitations

At maximum ranges, there are FM ranging limitations. MPRF detection
is not available at long ranges.

Short Range Search Mode (Primary)

Range While Search-Medium (MED)

This mode is good for a short range, look-down, cluttered environment. It
will detect both opening and closing velocity targets by using an all MPRF
waveform. Compared to INLV, this mode provides better breakout
capability. However, long range performance is less than that in LRS
modes (160 nm range not available). Target sort capability and range
resolution is better when compared to those in HPRF.

Advantage

The biggest advantage of this mode is its all-aspect target detection
capability.

Disadvantage

There are blind zones in the detection pattern.

RDR-2 D - 36


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_43.jpeg:
Limitations

The limited range against small targets is the biggest limitation of MED.
The max range for a small target is approximately 40 nm.

Other Search Modes

Range While Search-HIGH (HI)

Unlike INLV, HI transmission is all-HPRF waveform (radar BIT window
reads “HI”). This mode, under certain tactical conditions, allows longer
detection ranges than does INLV. Basically, these tactical conditions are
look-up and look-down for front aspect targets. The HI mode will
normally not detect tail aspect targets. This means that detecting a
maneuvering, long range target, is best done in INLV not HI.

Advantage

The greatest advantage of this mode is long range pickup. It aligns more
with a doppler mode than other RWS modes.

Disadvantage

The disadvantages of this mode are similar to the disadvantages of
doppler radars. HPRF search is not normally usable against beam and
tail aspect targets.

Limitations

The limitation of this mode is FM ranging.

Range-Gated High (RGH) Mode

The RGH mode employs an intermediate PRF falling between MPRF and
HPRF and allows detection of both frontal and tail aspect targets with
good ranging accuracy and sorting capability. A slower scan rate
(50°/second) and long pulse waveform are used in the 40, 80 and 160 nm
range scales. The 10 and 20 nm range scales use a 70°/second scan rate
and short-pulse waveform to increase target breakout capability.

D - 37 RDR-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_44.jpeg:
INLV is automatically invoked when F-15E altitude drops below 4000 feet
AGL and special mode E-1 is selected in order to reduce false targets.
When F-15E altitude is increased above 4500 feet AGL, normal RGH
operations resume.

Advantage

Longer range all aspect contacts.

Disadvantage

Detection range for front aspect targets is less than HPRF. Tail aspect
performance is limited on cospeed or tail closing targets. A slower scan
rate increases the time to search a volume of airspace.

Limitation

Aircraft altitude must be above 4000 feet AGL to use RGH mode. Target
maneuvering is difficult to see due to the slower scan rate.

Velocity Search (VS) Mode

The third LRS mode, velocity search, is the only pure doppler mode found
in the F-15E. The operator selects VS by pushing PB #8 on the MPD. The
VS mode is a nonranging HPRF waveform and is strictly for long range,
front aspect detection. The waveform in VS is more sensitive than the
waveform found in the HI mode; therefore, initial target detection should
be greater using VS. Presentation of target information on the display is
in terms of target relative ground speed (radial velocity) versus azimuth
(Figure D-28). Target relative ground speed (TRGS) is that component of
the target ground speed directly toward (away) from ownship.

In VS, the target must be a front aspect target with 80 to approximately
2400 knots of positive TRGS. For example, VS is the best search mode to
use for high, fast flyers like the Foxbat. Once a VS lock on is achieved, the
radar will continue to attempt to resolve range. When it does, the VS
track will automatically transfer to normal STT.

Advantage
It provides very distant radar contacts.
Disadvantage

There is no range information. Normal search is not available while using
VS. There is no detection of targets without a positive TRGS.

Limitation
The system requires at least 80 knots of positive TRGS before it displays
any targets on the radar scope. The steering dot and circle provide pure

pursuit steering.

Vector Scan (VCTR) Mode

The fourth LRS mode, vector scan, is an all-HPRF RWS that changes to a
slower antenna scan rate. It is mechanized for small RCS target
detection, but will normally give longer range contacts than HI on any size
target.

Advantage

The main advantage of vector scan is longer range pickups.

Disadvantage

Vector scan has poor beam and tail-on acquisitions, and due to its slow
scan rate, takes a much longer time to search a volume of airspace.

Limitation

FM ranging is a limitation. Also, due to the slow scan rate, target
Maneuvering may go undetected or create false targets.

Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_47.jpeg:
Highlight Mode

A special highlight mode can be entered from search with the MRM
selected, which provides track-like data for a target in search. To enter,
bracket target with acquisition symbol and select quickstep (front cockpit
coolie switch up for less than 1 second/rear cockpit castle switch depress
for less than 1 second).

NOTE

Highlight provides track-like information and symbology; however
the radar mode remains search. Launch of a missile from this mode

will result in a flood AIM-7 or visual AIM-120 shot.

When a target is highlighted, the radar enters a series of mini-rasters
about the selected target. Once vector status is achieved on the target,
mini-raster is exited. The radar then returns to the search bar, which was
interrupted for the highlight and completes the current scan.

Upon entry into the highlight mode, the acquisition symbol will stay
latched to the highlighted target until moved to another location. The
acquisition symbol will relatch if placed back over the highlighted target.

A 3/4 intensity diamond is placed over the highlighted target on the
display. The diamond receives a long heading vector if vector status is
achieved (sufficient hits to determine heading information). While the
highlighted target is identified, target data (true airspeed, aspect angle,
and mag heading) is displayed at the top left of the A/A radar display.
The highlighted target's altitude is displayed as a digital readout on the
left side of the display, and a range caret and Vc (combined overtake) are
displayed on the right side of the display. Target altitude, aspect angle,
the range caret (with Vc) and the TD box are displayed on the HUD
(Figure D-29). The weapon steering dot and weapon employment cue are
displayed on the HUD and radar display; the ASE circle and break X are

Periodic Doppler Mode

Although the INS is the main source of the radar's velocity data, the
aircrew should be aware that HPRF search modes will periodically enter a
doppler update mode. During this update, doppler GS updates the radar's
velocity data and positions the radar's main lobe clutter (MLC) filters.
There is no effect on GS or INS present position data. The update
requires approximately 3 seconds to complete. During the update, as the
display freezes, the aircrew will notice the azimuth and elevation carets
move to 0°. During the 3-second period, the antenna drives down 15°
below the INS horizon and alternately left or right 45°.

The doppler update is fully automatic and occurs approximately every
7 minutes. The only aircrew action that can prevent the update is to
operate in an all medium PRF. The update mode is automatically
inhibited in TWS and during the presence of jamming (AOJ). If the
seven-minute timer expires during STT or HOJ extrapolate, the
three-second update occurs 32 seconds after RTS.

F-15E RADAR INTRODUCTION
Description

The F-15E radar is a high frequency, pulse doppler, attack radar. Its
design is optimized for both air-to-ground and air-to-air combat. In the
air-to-air mode, the radar provides target range, range rate and angular
rates to the CC for attack computations. The CC digitally produces and
displays radar targets on the MPD based on radar information. Radar
controls are available on the MPD/MPCD and HOTAS. The radar
operates with utility A hydraulics and main generator power.

Multifrequency

The F-15E radar is a multifrequency radar. The capability exists to
spread the operating frequency across a wide band of the electromagnetic
spectrum. This reduces mutual interference and enhances jamming
avoidance. The radar's band is selectable on the MPD/MPCD with PB #20
(Figure D-1). The channel is selectable with PB #19. The combination of
band/channel selection determines the radar operating frequency in
search.

D-1 RDR-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_8.jpeg:
Interference

Mutual radar interference is likely with F-15E radars operating on the
same frequency (Figure D-1). To prevent mutual interference (MI), widely
separated bands and channels will be assigned during the premission
brief.

AIM-7 problems due to mutual interference are a potential problem within
an individual flight. Ifthe flight's frequencies are too close together, one
radar can degrade the AIM-7 performance of another. You can reduce
potential problems by selecting radar channels as widely separated as
possible.

Multi PRF

The APG-70 uses different PRFs to perform its various functions. Specific
aspects and ranging functions have their own assigned PREF.

Aspect

High PRF (HPRF) provides the high aspect, nose-on capability of doppler
radar. Medium PRF (MPRF) improves the all-aspect capability.

RDR-2 D-2


Text from RDR-2_APG-70_Introduction_page_9.jpeg:
Ranging

High PRF ranging in radar search is done in accordance with the FM
ranging process discussed in the RDR-2 lesson. Medium PRF ranging is
done by the pulse method of timing. The radar uses multiple PRFs to
reach an accord on the exact range before displaying the target.

Search

In addition to HPRF or MPRF search, the F-15E is capable of a
combination PRF search. This interleaved PRF uses both high and
medium PRF waveforms. Multiple PRF search improves the all-aspect
detection capability, but at a price. Often the same target appears at
different ranges on the display (range ambiguity). This is due to the type
of PRF (high or medium) at the time of acquisition.

Phase Comparison Monopulse

The F-15E radar is a phase comparison monopulse tracker (Figure D-2).
It is very similar to the monopulse radar discussed previously. The sine
wave phase comparison of the reflected energy determines azimuth and
elevation errors.

GUNS auto locks in MPRF out to 15 nm. SS, BST and VTS auto lock in
MPRF out to 10 nm. Long range boresight auto locks in interleaved PRF
out to 40 nm. The minimum range for the auto acq modes is 500 feet,
except for GUNS and LR BST, which is 3000 feet due to a longer pulse
width.

It is necessary to be in search or to reject any previous target lock before
selecting an auto acq mode. Weapons select switch position has no effect
on selecting SS, BST, LR BST and VTS with the FCP auto acq switch.
Forward and release once within one second on the FCP auto acq switch
selects supersearch. Forward (in less than one second) twice and release
selects boresight. Forward and hold on the auto acq switch for one second
or longer selects long range boresight. Aft for less than one second on the
auto acq switch selects vertical scan (Figure D-4, left). The pilot activates
the GUNS mode by selecting it on the throttle weapon select switch
(Figure D-4, right). Auto acq modes selected on the FCP stick (auto acq
switch) have priority over the GUNS mode and over any other radar
search mode. When selecting auto acq modes from the FCP stick, the scan
patterns continue until target acquisition or mode rejection. The GUNS
auto acq scan pattern will continue until target acquisition, initiation of
another auto acq mode or movement of the weapons select switch out of
the GUN position. Once lock on occurs from any mode, the pilot may
select any air-to-air weapon/attack steering display.

Supersearch

When activating supersearch, the radar searches a 20° x 20° area depicted
in the HUD by a 20° reference circle (Figure D-5). The scan is an aircraft
stabilized, six-bar pattern centered 4° below the waterline symbol and is
used to enhance lock-on capability during F-15E target maneuvering. The
first target detected within this pattern is automatically acquired and
tracked. It is difficult to selectively lock a particular target when multiple
targets are in the FOV of supersearch.

The SS scan center initializes in the HUD center (-4° below waterline) and
can be elevated/depressed up/down center to +28° or -19° via a full
up/down action on the FCP TDC. There are no intermediate positions.
This results in a corresponding scan shift that provides “vertical scan”
capability with the benefit of SS area coverage (Figure D-6).

Figure D - 6. Positionable SS.

The SS half circle down picture in the HUD represents the radar scan
coverage fairly accurately. However, the half circle up picture can be
misleading. 28° up center from the waterline places the radar scan
completely above the HUD. In fact, think of the up center scan pattern as
“sitting on top of the canopy bow.” This creates a SS blank area of +6° to
+18° (effectively from the top of the HUD to the canopy bow) that cannot
be used for acquisition.

Boresight

BST slaves the antenna to the radar boresight line (RBL)(W) and
initiates an auto acquisition range search along the antenna LOS. The

4° BST reference circle on the HUD (Figure D-7) allows the pilot to
maintain the target within the BST scan pattern and provides a rapid and
highly discriminating lock on capability.

Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_14.jpeg:
Long Range Boresight

Long range boresight auto acq mode acquires long range targets located
along the RBL (pilot sees a contrail and wants to lock on with an auto acq
mode). Once again, the radar slaves the antenna to the RBL and initiates
an auto acq range search along the antenna LOS from 3000 feet out to

40 nm. The radar continues in auto acq search until it acquires a target
or the crew commands return to search. A 2.5° reference circle is
displayed on the HUD to approximate search pattern coverage (Figure
D-8).

When entering LR BST from SS, the radar enters BST at initial actuation
of the auto acq switch and then enters LR BST when the pilots holds the
switch for 1 second or longer. When entering LR BST from any other
mode, the radar enters SS and then goes to LR BST when the pilot holds
the switch for 1 second or longer. If the radar achieves track before the
pilot holds the switch for 1 second or longer, it remains in STT.

During LR BST, the radar range scale changes to 40 nm. Ifthe crew exits
LR BST to search (mode reject), the radar returns to the selected range
scale.

Vertical Scan

In VTS, the radar searches from 5° to 55° above RBL and 7.5° in azimuth.
The vertical scan reference line on the HUD (Figure D-9) provides the
pilot with an aiming reference to help bring the target within the radar
scan pattern. This scan pattern starts at the top of the HUD (top of the
line) and goes up to +55°. This mode affords fairly rapid and selective
auto acquisition of visual targets positioned along the aircraft’s lift vector.
As an example, to auto lock a bandit spotted at about 1-2 o’clock level,
thumb aft and release on the auto acq switch, and roll 90° right to place
him above the HUD and on an imaginary extended VTS line of the HUD
(above the center mirror is a useful reference (Figure D-10)).

GUNS Mode

The GUNS auto acq radar scan pattern covers a large volume of airspace
(60° in azimuth, 20° in elevation) and is space stabilized to the INS
horizon (Figure D-11). When initialized by selecting GUN on the weapon
select switch (not in STT or DTWS), the scan centers on 0° AZ

(aircraft W )/EL (INS horizon), but the pilot may slew via the TDC to the
AZ/EL limits of the radar. Displayed altitude coverage data on the radar
display is based on a fixed 7.5 nm range. The pilot changes elevation and
azimuth angles by moving the acquisition symbol up/down and left/right,
respectively, on the A/A radar display. Excessive look angles (i.e.
acquisition symbols well above/below the center of the scope) give a false
picture of actual radar coverage. After selection of GUN but prior to
acquisition of a target inside 15 nm, the radar displays targets detected
between 15 and 20 nm. These targets cannot be acquired with manual or
auto lock while still in GUN. The pilot can select all other auto acq modes
during the GUNS scan (i.e., they will take precedence over GUNS scan).

Mode reject reinitializes the scan center to 0° AZ (aircraft w= / EL (INS
horizon) while in GUNS search. If the radar locks and the pilot then
selects mode reject, the radar initiates “bump” acquisition. During bump
acquisition, the radar breaks lock, positions the scan center 5° right and
1.7° down from the original target, and resumes the GUNS scan.

SINGLE TARGET TRACK (STT) AND PRF TRACK TRANSFER

The primary function of single target track is to provide target data
required for accurate weapon delivery. The STT mode utilizes three
semi-independent tracking loops in its calculations: one for angle, one for
velocity and one for range. The radar tracks the target in angle and
velocity during HPRF. In MPRF, the radar tracks the target in angle,
velocity and range. MPRF ranging is more accurate than the FM ranging
employed in HPRF; however, AIM-7s require HPRF illumination of the
target for proper guidance.

If acquisition occurs in HPRF (“HI” in radar BIT window), the radar
attempts to switch to MPRF. At target ranges beyond the MPRF
capability, the radar performs FM ranging every % second (using the
HPRF waveform) to provide an approximate target range. Inside 40 nm,
the radar attempts MPRF ranging every 3 seconds. When MPRF ranging
is successful (target is detected in MPRF), the radar stops FM ranging,
but continues to track in HPRF. Inside 30 nm, the radar transfers to
MPRF track (“MED” in radar BIT window). The exact range is a function
of target size and signal strength. Selecting MRM and MASTER ARM
does not prevent the transfer to MPRF, unless maximum AIM-7 launch
range is outside of 30 nm. This may be the case if the F-15E is at medium
or high altitude, or the target is extremely high and fast.

While tracking a target in MPRF with master arm (ARM, MRM selected
and an AIM-7 in priority), the radar attempts to transfer back to HPRF
when target range is less than 1.2 Raero (Raero is based on MRM
aerodynamic range) for frontal aspect targets and 1.05 Raero for rear
aspect targets. HPRF track transfer from MPRF final track takes 1.5 to
2 seconds. However, it may never occur against a beam aspect or co-speed
tail aspect target. Maneuver to move the target out of the main beam
clutter, or accelerate/decelerate to shift its doppler away from the altitude
line. This may allow the radar to upgrade to HPRF final track for AIM-7
launch. With an AIM-120 in priority, the radar continuously attempts to
transfer to MPRF when target range is less than 30 nm.

TRACK DISPLAYS

In STT, the radar provides target range, range rate, velocity, antenna
angles, and angular rates to the central computer (CC) for computation of
weapon attack mode parameters. Once lock on occurs (either manual or
auto acq), the track display presented is a function of the weapon select
switch position. The parameters displayed include: target true airspeed,
aspect angle, magnetic heading, altitude, heading vector, range and range
rate (opening/closing velocity between fighter and target, or Vc).

Figures D-12 through D-19 depict a sequence of track displays from initial
lock through break X (weapon select switch: MRM/SRM/GUN). Aspect
angle (AA) is the angle from the tail of the target measured around to the
radar line of sight from the fighter and is displayed in degrees divided by
10 (15 aspect angle equals 150°). An L or R following the aspect angle
indicates which side of the target you are seeing. Altitude appears
adjacent to the antenna elevation caret and above the star in thousands of
feet. At the elevation caret, the dash between the first digit(s) and the
last digit represents a decimal point; thus, 20-1 represents 20,100 feet. A
caret on the right side of the display indicates range. Vc appears left of
the range caret. The vector stick indicates target heading relative to the
center scribe line (fighter heading) and will move if the target maneuvers.
Bearing and range to the tracked target from the selected bullseye point
appears to the right of fighter ground speed.

NOTE

The heading vector oscillates 10° to 20° (or more) in STT when there are
multiple targets in the radar beam.

ASE Circle/Steering Dot

The ASE circle and steering dot relate lead angle error (LAE). The circle
represents the maximum steering error that is normally acceptable for
missile launch. The pilot should maneuver the aircraft to position the
steering dot inside the circle.

MRM Range Symbols

The Raero, Ropt, Rpi, Rmnvr, Rtr and Rmin symbols display when radar
track exists in MRM. Your aircraft velocity is assumed constant
throughout the pickle to separation time for computation of all zones.
Steering dot centered is assumed for computation of the displayed Raero
and Ropt; actual (current) steering limited to the maximum size of the
ASE circle is used for all other zone calculations. Refer to

TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1 for additional parameters used in determining missile
ranges.

Raero (Maximum Aerodynamic Range)

Raero, indicated by a triangle, is the absolute maximum missile launch
range and is calculated using optimal ownship steering, including lofting.
This zone assumes that the target executes no maneuver (i.e., current
velocity is assumed constant).

The first time a target intercept can be computed taking into account
Raero constraints and current steering errors is known as Raero (current).
The presence of the shoot cue indicates that Raero (current) has been
reached.

Ropt (Maximum Range Probability of Intercept with Optimum Steering)

Ropt, indicated by a circle, is a special case of Rpi calculated assuming
steering dot centered in the ASE circle (optimal steering) and is the same
as Rpi in other respects. This zone assumes that the target executes no
maneuver (i.e., current velocity is assumed constant with no acceleration).

For AIM-7s, Ropt cannot be greater than the calculated dynamic seeker
range. DSR is not displayed.

Rpi (Maximum Range Probability of Intercept with Current Steering)

Rpi is the maximum launch range with current steering that assures a
high likelihood of success. This zone assumes that the target executes no
maneuver (i.e., current velocity is assumed constant with no acceleration).
As the pilot optimizes the steering by centering the dot in the ASE circle,
current steering closely approaches optimal steering, and Rpi approaches
Ropt. With the dot centered, Rpi and Ropt are the same.

For AIM-7s, Rpi cannot be greater than the calculated dynamic seeker
range. DSR is not displayed.

D-15 RDR-3


Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_22.jpeg:
Rmnvr (Maximum Launch Range Against a Maneuvering Target)

Rmnvr (indicated by the sideways golf tee shaped symbol) represents the
maximum launch range against a target executing a constant speed, level,
4-¢ turn towards the tail at launch, to a designated aspect angle as
entered on the ARMT (Top Level PACS Menu, PB #16) display or via
MC/DTM. Ifthe current target aspect is less than the entered target
aspect (i.e., closer to tail aspect), then Rmnvr equals Rpi. Entering 180°
aspect (OFF displayed at PB #16) inhibits computation and display of
Rmnvr since it is impossible to turn towards the tail and be at a head
aspect when the turn is complete. Refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1.

Rtr (Range Turn and Run)

Rtr indicates the maximum launch range against a target executing an
evasive turn and run maneuver at launch and is calculated assuming
current ownship steering. A vertical line connects Rtr and Rmin. The
target turn capability is based on F-15E specific power (Ps) curves under
the following conditions.

F100-PW-229 engines
Clean aircraft

50% fuel remaining
Maximum power
Standard day

This zone assumes that the target executes a maximum g level maneuver
with instantaneous g onset in the shortest direction to tail aspect; target
speed is assumed constant until the target reaches tail aspect, and then
increases per the capability in the conditions listed above.

RDR-3 D-16


Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_23.jpeg:
Rmin (Minimum Launch Range)

Rmin is the minimum launch range that assures any likelihood of success.
Target accelerations are assumed constant for the Rmin TOF. Your
aircraft velocity is assumed constant throughout the pickle to separation
time.

MRM Digital Maneuvering Cue (DMC)

The DMC appears just below the target Vc when the target range is less
than or equal to Rpi and greater than or equal to Rtr. The cue indicates
the maximum number of degrees the target can turn in the shortest
direction towards the tail without defeating the priority missile for the
current conditions. The target maneuver is a level 4-g turn initiated at
pickle; target speed is constant. The radar displays a T when:

e the target aspect is tail, or
e a target turn to tail will not defeat the priority missile.

TOF/TTA/TTI

Predicted TOF/TTA displays between Raero (current) and Rmin with the
steering dot inside the ASE circle. TOF/TTA updates for changes in target
radar angle and range. For AIM-7 missiles, the letter “T” precedes this
TOF to indicate time to impact. For AIM-120, time without any preceding
letter indicates time to active after launch. If the letter “H” or “M”
precedes this time, then the AIM-120 missile is already inside active
range.

If target azimuth exceeds 45° right or left in STT, the radar goes into an

TRACK-WHILE-SCAN (TWS)

TWS is a mode that affords a near all-aspect, multi-target detection and
track capability within a selected area. TWS can provide the “big picture”
via rapid altitude sampling between targets, wide volume search and a
plan view of target formations with heading vectors. Track data is made
available with reduced effect on target RWR. In addition, TWS furnishes
a situational picture for high confidence final sorts.

There are two different TWS rates and two different TWS modes
available. The TWS rates are normal rate TWS (NTWS) and high data
rate TWS (HDTWS). In NTWS, frame time varies from 2.2 to 2.6 seconds,
and three scan patterns are available: 2 bar, 60° azimuth; 4 bar, 30°
azimuth; and 6 bar, 15° azimuth. In HDTWS, two scan patterns are
available: 3 bar/30° and 2 bar/30°. Frame time is 1.5 seconds in 3 bar
HDTWS and 1 second in 2 bar HDTWS.

Designated TWS (DTWS) mode or nondesignated TWS (NDTWS) mode
can use either of the two rates. Designated TWS ties the scan pattern
around a primary designated target (PDT), which provides detailed
information on that target, and also maintains track files on other targets.
In NDTWS, the scan pattern is not tied to any target. (The search pattern
can be positioned to the radar and elevation scan limits).

TWS selection is inhibited if GUN is selected on the weapon select switch,
an AIM-7 launch is in progress, and/or an AIM-7 is in flight.

TWS Rates

From search, depress and release the FCP TDC or go full action on the
RCP trigger, and thumb aft on the FCP auto acq/RCP mode reject switch
to select NTWS or auto acq forward for greater than or equal to 1 second
or less than 1 second selects different versions of HDTWS (see Figure
D-20 and D-21). From STT, thumb aft on the auto acq/mode reject switch
to enable NTWS. To enter HDTWS from STT, thumb forward greater
than or equal to 1 second or less than 1 second on the auto acq/mode reject
switch. To enter STT from either HDTWS or NTWS, thumb aft on the
auto acq.

TWS Modes

Whenever the crew enters TWS from search (or if all targets are manually
undesignated), the radar operates in NDTWS mode. If the crew initiates
TWS from STT (or if the crew designates a track file in NDTWS by placing
the acq symbol over the track file and pressing the FCP TDC/RCP
trigger), the radar enters DTWS operation with a track file established
from the designated target (STT) data. Thus it is possible to alternate
between NDTWS and DTWS.

Positioning the weapon select switch to GUN (in DTWS) also causes the
radar to enter STT. When the pilot selects GUN during NDTWS, the
radar enters the auto acq GUNS mode. Note, depressing the auto acq
switch (except in GUNS) eventually returns the radar to search.

Scan Patterns

Normal TWS (Designated or Nondesignated)

When the crew initiates NTWS, three AZ/EL scan parameters are
selectable: 2 bar, 60°; 4 bar, 30°; and 6 bar, 15° TWS patterns respectively
(Figure D-22). Az bumping is available to select between 2 bar, 60° and

4 bar, 30°. To select 6 bar, 15° position the acq symbol into the radar BIT
window. The word “NARROW” will then appear in the BIT window.
When “NARROW?” is present, designate by pressing FCP TDC/RCP
trigger, the scan becomes 6 bar, 15°. Az bumping changes from 6 bar, 15°
to 4 bar, 30°. When the radar is in TWS, the radar BIT window reflects
the number of bars of the elevation scan (2, 4 or 6) followed by the
acronym “TWS,” followed by the PRF in which the radar is operating

(H for HPRF, M for MPRF, blank for interleaved PRF). As an example, if
the radar is in 2 bar, 60° azimuth scan, medium PRF track-while-scan,
the BIT window would reflect “2TWSM.” Range scale switching also
operates the same as in normal search (via the TDC).

The el wheel controls the elevation scan center in NDTWS. The
acquisition symbol position determines the azimuth scan center. As the
crew moves the scan pattern off the NDTWS targets, the track files go half
intensity. If the files enter track memory (i.e., begin flashing), moving the
search pattern back to cover the target AZ/EL position before or during
flashing should update and retain the track files.

In DTWS, the radar automatically controls the elevation and azimuth
scan center to accommodate the designated target(s) and other track file
targets. Lower priority targets are deleted when all detected targets
cannot be maintained within the elevation or azimuth coverage.

The crew can override DTWS azimuth scan logic by positioning the acq
symbol left or right. Once the crew shifts the scan position in this
manner, the radar automatically maintains only the primary designated
target. The radar automatically recenters the az scan center with any
subsequent target redesignation or azimuth bump.

DTWS elevation scan logic may be biased up or down in 4 and 6 bar TWS
by normal antenna elevation HOTAS. The radar BIT window will
indicate “UTWS” for up bias and “DTWS” for down bias. Designated
targets will be retained in coverage.

patterns. The faster data gathering (frame time) provides an increased
capability against maneuvering targets. AZ bumping in HDTWS will take
you to 2 bar/60° NTWS. When in HDTWS, the radar BIT window reflects
2 HDT and 3 HDT to indicate 2 bar or 3 bar respectively.

Target Processing

The radar maintains track files (in terms of range, angle and rate) on up
to 10 targets and supplies this data to the CC for correlation and update
on an end of frame basis. The first hit produces an observation target (up
to 20 of them) at the end of that frame. Observation targets are deleted if
they do not receive a second hit within the next two frames (NTWS), or
the next three frames (HDTWS). Targets that receive 4 hits become
established track file targets, and are displayed with a relative heading
vector.

All established track file targets abide by the following logic:

e Targets at ranges greater than 20 nm or less than 10 nm that have not
been updated for 10 seconds are deleted (full intensity for 6 seconds,
and then flash for 4 seconds).

e At ranges between 10 nm and 20 nm, a 15 second timer is used (11
seconds full intensity, 4 seconds flashing).

When track file range is beyond (not more than 10 nm beyond) the
displayed range scale, these track files are maintained unless outside of
radar coverage. If all the designated targets are deleted, the radar enters
NDTWS.

Once a target has an established track file, it remains on the display and
moves in a predicted direction based on the latest target hit. Thus, TWS
can provide increased situational awareness through continuously
displayed target information compared to the intermittent display of
normal search.

Target Displays
NDTWS

The NDTWS display (Figure D-24) is similar to the standard A/A search
display. The bar number readout indicates the number of bars in the
selected scan pattern, rather than the current bar number as in normal
search. When the crew selects HDTWS, HDT (i.e., HDTWS) follows the
bar number. TWS track files begin as observation targets (half intensity
symbol).

Other target symbols are unique to the TWS display. Full intensity
symbols with a relative heading vector indicate those targets for which the
radar has sufficient correlation to maintain a track file and are inside the
current scan coverage. Target altitude displays above track files with
vector status. During NDTWS, the radar computer ranks the track file
targets based on first merge criteria (aspect, range and velocity). The
target determined to be the first merged target is called the radar priority
target (RPT). A strobe of six open box symbols denotes angle only (AO)

track file targets. (Further discussion of AO and jamming targets will be
provided in RDR-6.)

Placing the acquisition symbol over a short vector target (in NDTWS or
DTWS) moves the altitude readout to the left of the acq symbols and
target Mach number (if Mach <0.4 or 21.1) displays to the right. The
vector stick will increase in length to a long vector.

DTWS

The crew may designate up to eight TWS targets (track or observation)
via normal lock-on procedures. One designated target will be the primary
designated target (PDT). The seven other TWS designated targets will be
secondary designated targets (SDTs). After entry into DTWS (at least one
target is designated initially), auto designation of all targets with vector
status is possible by boxing “AUTO” at PB #10. Once designated, a target
receives a long heading vector (Figure D-26). If you observe a high
interest track file, and 8 targets have already been designated, one of
those targets must be undesignated prior to designating the new file. To
do this, slew the acquisition symbols over a lower priority designated
target, and thumb aft on the FCP boat switch, or thumb left on the RCP
castle switch (Figure D-25). (If the crew undesignates all targets in this
manner, the radar enters NDTWS.)

The crew can move the PDT status to other SDTs via quick step.
Momentary activation of quick step moves the PDT status to other SDTs
in this order (you cannot quick step to nondesignated TWS targets):

e The SDT next farther out in range

e Ifthe current PDT is farthest in range, then the left most AO SDT,
and then left to right through the designated AO SDT

e Ifthe current PDT is an AO track target farthest right in azimuth
(i.e., lowest ranking), then the shortest range SDT becomes the PDT

Any SDT can be made the PDT by quick pick. Quick pick is accomplished
by redesignating (less than one second) an SDT. That SDT then becomes
the PDT.

When the crew removes the PDT status from a designated target by quick
step or quick pick, the target reverts to an SDT.

Dual Target Track (DTT)

This TWS mode allows a two-target track capability of two widely spaced
targets—a PDT and SDT. Independent scan patterns (2 mini frames) are
used to track these two targets. These mini frames consist of two mini
rasters of 4 bars with 4.5° azimuth, and 1.5° elevation bar spacing each.
To enter DTT from DTWS, redesignate a secondary designated target for
longer than 1 second. There are several options for exiting DTT. For

SEARCH SORT

Sort is a 30°, space-stabilized search scan (Figure D-27) that assists in
rapid detection of closely spaced targets. The acquisition symbol and scan
pattern stay pointed at the proper volume of space (within gimbal limits)
to reduce crew workload during maneuvers. If the antenna reaches
gimbal limits during this process, the 30° search continues at that limit.
Azimuth bumping does not occur without moving the TDC. Elevation
bars used are changed automatically according to radar range scale
selected, and are not as selected at PB #2, “EL” control.

Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_48.jpeg:
Sort is selectable during search or STT. The scan centers at the
acquisition symbol when entered from search. The crew selects sort from
search by depressing the FCP TDC or going full action on the RCP trigger
for more than one second. It is not possible to enter sort via azimuth
bumping, or from auto acq or flood. When the crew selects MODE
REJECT from auto acq lock, flood or STT, the radar initializes to the sort
mode.

If the crew initiates sort while in STT, the radar breaks lock and the scan
centers on the tracked target. If the crew initiates sort while in HOJ or
HOJ track extrapolate, the radar enters sort scan centered on the
jammer’s az/el position. Sort scan locus is adjustable through normal
controls for azimuth, elevation and range. The radar automatically
controls bar spacing and the number of bars as a function of the radar
range scale.

This sort mode is not the same as the TWS SORT mode presented earlier
in this workbook.

FLOOD
Manual Selection-MPRF

If lock on by the preferred methods cannot be obtained, MPRF flood mode
can be manually selected via PB #13 on the MPD/MPCD. The FLOOD
command from PB #18 is ignored in STT, TWS, or BIT. The main
antenna drives to a 60° look-down angle (to clear the path for the flood
antenna) and the flood antenna output is energized (MPRF). The FLOOD
cue appears below PB #19. This mode can provide backup air-to-air gun
ranging (out to 2 nm) for the nearest target within flood range and flood
antenna beamwidth. MPRF flood ranging is used with the LCOS track
funnel gunsight display in the HUD.

Manual Selection—-HPRF

If the radar is in STT or DTWS, the pilot can manually select HPRF flood
illumination at AIM-7 missile launch by holding the FCP coolie switch
down prior to and while pressing the pickle button.

The crew can also manually select HPRF flood illumination after an
AIM-7 launch in STT by pressing aft on the auto acq switch for greater
than 1 second.

Automatic Selection—HPRF

Flood horn HPRF radiation is automatically provided at certain times
during AIM-7 operations. HPRF flood is automatically provided at AIM-7
launch if the radar is in search. Auto flood also occurs during HPRF track
extrapolate (memory) operations if the target is inside of flood antenna
range and FOV, or if HPRF track is not achieved within 1 second of
launch initiation from STT, or 3 seconds from DTWS.

The radar attempts a confirmed HPRF track upgrade within % second of
launch initiation from MPRF final track or HPRF probationary track. If
unsuccessful, HPRF flood illumination activates. The launch-to-eject cycle
is not delayed.

The launch cycle delays for up to 3 seconds when the MRM fire signal
occurs during DTWS operation. If the radar does not achieve HPRF STT
within this 3 second period, the radar initiates flood illumination for
missile launch. The radar does not delay HPRF FLOOD at launch when
targets are within the FOV at less than 5 nm in the front and 3 nm in the
stern.

HPRF flood illumination is effective to approximately 8 nm, depending on
target size. As in manual HPRF flood operations, the HUD is the primary
attack reference. The pilot steers to maintain the target within the 12°
MRM reference circle during the AIM-7 fly out.

Any activation of the auto acq switch suspends automatic flood ops and
commands the selected mode. (GUNS scan does not interrupt flood.)

Refer to TO 1F-15E-34-1-1-1 for additional information.
Velocity Search Boresight (VS BST) Mode

The VS BST mode provides HPRF AIM-7 illumination similar to the

TEXT

The APG-70 is a coherent, multiple PRF, multi-mode attack radar. It has
the capability to search for, acquire and track airborne targets as well as
provide air-to-ground mapping and ranging. The radar set, in concert
with TEWS indications, provides the aircrew with the options of threat
avoidance, engagement and air-to-surface mission accomplishment.
Several operational modes and multiple radar features assist in air-to-air
weapons employment.

(To enhance readability, some information has been omitted from the
radar and HUD displays throughout this workbook. Switchology
presentations assume crewmember is in command of the air-to-air radar
display.)

TARGET ACQUISITION
Manual Acquisition

Manual radar lock on (target designation or acquisition) is typically
employed in an intercept environment at medium to long range. In
search, use the TDC to bracket (enclose) the target with the acquisition
symbol (Figure D-1). This is done by pressing the TDC left/right/up/down
to move the acquisition symbol, likewise on the radar display.

Text from RDR-3_Air-to-Air_Modes_Switchology__Displays_page_8.jpeg:
Depressing and releasing the FCP TDC commands the radar to enter a
+8° azimuth acquisition scan (miniraster) centered on the acquisition
symbol in azimuth and search the selected bar pattern in elevation. (Two
bar initially and then the selected bar pattern after 1.5 seconds.)
Releasing the TDC allows manual lock on or acquisition (STT), if the acq
symbol is bracketing a target. Full action and release on the RCP
handcontroller trigger commands miniraster. Releasing the trigger allows
lock on, if the acq symbol is bracketing a target (Figure D-2). Ifthe pilot
does not release the FCP TDC (WSO/RCP trigger) within one second, the
radar enters search sort mode. Normally for a single target, depress and
release the TDC/trigger in one action (< 1 sec) with the acquisition symbol
on the target.

If the radar does not achieve lock on (no target within the acq symbol or

scan selected (never less than two). Push down on the FCP/RCP auto
acquisition switch (mode reject) to return to search and attempt to
reacquire, if desired (Figure D-3). If the radar achieves lock on, mode
reject also returns to search. Mode reject also clears the radar display of
false targets (“birds”).

Auto Acquisition (Auto Acq)

There are several radar auto acq modes: supersearch (SS), boresight
(BST), long range boresight (LR BST), vertical scan (VTS) and GUNS.
These modes are only selectable from the front cockpit (assumes the pilot
has command of the A/A radar display). These modes place the radar into
a specific scan pattern, prepared for auto acquisition. When the pilot
points the aircraft so that the target enters the radar scan pattern, the
radar automatically acquires (locks on) the target. The pilot will normally
point the aircraft by visual reference to the target. Additionally, SS, BST,
LR BST and VTS are aircraft stabilized, while GUNS is INS horizon
stabilized vertically and aircraft stabilized horizontally.

AAI/Radar Compatible Modes

All radar search and track modes are compatible with AAI, except narrow
(six-bar/15°) TWS, guns search and velocity search. AAI is operative and the
appropriate reply symbology will be displayed with the radar in STBY or
SNIFF (but only if interrogation is performed in noncorrelated fashion). AAI
reply symbology will also be displayed on the A/G radar display. When the
radar is functioning in the A/G RBM mode, interrogations are performed in
the correct code mode, regardless of UFC settings, thus deleting any
requirement for correlation. AAI is also functional with weight-on-wheels.

UFC/AAI INTERFACE
UFC AAI/EID Submenus

For the purpose of this text, the mechanics of the AAI/EID submenus are
almost identical. Aircrew HOTAS switchology will determine whether an
interrogation sequence is based on the AAI submenu settings or EID
submenu settings. The direction the aircrew moves the interrogation switch
will determine which settings are used (AAI or EID).

UFC Menu 1

The modes selected for interrogating on both the AAI and EID submenus are
displayed on Menu 1 at PB #8 (Figure D-1) with the A and/or E followed by
the modes selected for interrogation. If the number of selected modes results
in more characters than can normally be displayed, the legend at PB #3 (IFF)
is shortened to just “I.” If the AAI/EID are slaved to the IFF, “S” is displayed
as the last character. (More about slaving later in this text.)

Text from RDR-4_AAI_EID_Employment_page_14.jpeg:
The modes to be utilized during an interrogation sequence are alternately
selected (asterisk)/deselected (no asterisk) by depressing the appropriate push
button. The codes and N (for interrogating mode only) or C (for interrogating
mode and correct code) are selected via scratchpad entry as is selecting codes
A, B or AB for mode 4. The code and/or N or C can be entered separately (i.e.,
11 or C) or together (i.e., 11C, AN, BC, etc.). Changes (either to the AAI/EID
submenu or through UFC Menu 1) cannot be input while an interrogation is
in progress. A mode 4 interrogation uses the mode 4 codes (A, B, or AB)
keyed into the IFF mode 4 system (door 3R) by maintenance personnel. Mode
4A is the current day’s mode 4 code; 4B is the next day’s code. 4B (or 4AB)
should normally only be interrogated after midnight Zulu to prevent
compromising the next day’s codes. If the mode 4 is not keyed (has been
dumped or zeroed) then there is no mode 4 interrogation capability because
mode 4 interrogations are always performed as correct code (regardless of the
N or C displayed on the UFC adjacent to the mode 4 legend). The mode 4
switches on the FCP left console have no effect on the AAI system (except
zeroing the mode 4 codes, which prevents mode 4 interrogation replies from
being evaluated by the IRE).

Toggling PB #9 on the AAI or EID submenus alternately selects 2 or 4. Each
selected mode will be interrogated for the number of radar sweeps selected (2
or 4).

The AUTO ID feature on the AAI or EID submenu cycles among the following
options:

@ OFF - AUTO ID feature is off.
@ STT - AUTO ID feature is active when the radar enters STT.

@ PDT - AUTO ID feature is active when the radar enters a track mode,
including STT, DTWS, DTT.

@ AUTO ID-EID (on the AAI submenu) or AUTO ID-AAT (on the EID
submenu) signifies that AUTO ID is active, but the selections on the other
submenu will be utilized, when the AUTO ID feature initiates an
interrogation sequence.

The AUTO ID feature automatically starts an interrogation sequence (with
no further aircrew action required), cycling through all selected modes when
the radar enters STT (AUTO ID-STT), or track (AUTO ID-PDT), and the STT
target or PDT does not already have a valid interrogation ID associated with
it. In other words, the target has not been ID’d since current track on it was

achieved. AUTO ID-PDT includes radar entry to STT. When an
interrogation sequence is commanded by the AUTO ID feature, it is the same
that would be commanded by a manual interrogation via aircrew HOTAS
action to initiate the AAI or the EID programmed sequence. The AUTO ID
feature is not applicable in the Highlight radar mode. For this purpose,
Highlight is treated as a search, vice track mode.

INTERROGATE SWITCHES

The FCP coolie switch on the right throttle (right multifunction switch)
(Figure D-4) is used to manually start or stop interrogations. Outboard
deflection interfaces with selections on the UFC AAI submenu, while inboard
deflection interfaces with selections on the UFC EID submenu. Command of
the radar is not required.

Text from RDR-4_AAI_EID_Employment_page_17.jpeg:
An interrogation sequence is initiated with switch deflection (FCP or RCP),
while there is no interrogation in progress. If the switch is held for less than
1 second, the interrogation sequence stops when the switch is released. If the
switch is held for longer than 1 second, the interrogation sequence is latched
and continues until each mode selected on the appropriate UFC AAI or EID
submenu has been interrogated for the selected number of radar sweeps.
Given that the modes are selected, the interrogation sequence follows the
order: mode 4 first, mode 1, mode 2 and then mode 3.

The interrogation sequence stops when any of the following occur.

@ All selected modes have been interrogated (each for the selected number of
radar sweeps).

@ The crew member initiating the interrogation stops the interrogation by
deflecting the cockpit switch for greater than 1 second while an
interrogation is in progress. The pilot cannot stop a WSO-initiated
interrogation and vice versa. Kither crew member can stop an AUTO ID
initiated interrogation. The interrogation switch can be deflected in either
direction. (An AAI deflection will stop an EID interrogation and vice
versa.)

@ Ifthe radar isin STT or DTT, the interrogation sequence stops once the
radar STT or DTT target is correlated with a friendly interrogation reply.
(Important concept!)

An AAT interrogation sequence cannot be initiated while an EID
interrogation is in progress and vice versa. Changes to the interrogation
parameters through the UFC cannot be made while an interrogation is in
progress. If the aircrew stops an interrogation sequence, the next
interrogation begins at the beginning of the UFC programmed sequence, not
where the previous interrogation was stopped.

RADAR/HUD INTERROGATION CUES
Radar and HUD Cues

A circle (high confidence mode 4 reply) or diamond (low confidence mode 4 or
a mode 1, 2, 3 reply) can be displayed on the HUD and radar (A/A radar
display or A/G radar display). The determinator of high confidence/low
confidence for the mode 4 reply is, in simplified terms, a threshold ratio of
total interrogation pulses versus valid replies.

HUD Cues

In the A/A, NAV and INST master modes and with the radar in a track mode,
interrogation reply symbology (circle or diamond) is displayed in the HUD TD
box commensurate with the last valid ID of the STT or current PDT (Figure
D-6). The ID symbology appears where the TD box is commanded,
independent of whether the TD box is actually being displayed. For example
in GUNS track when the TD box and gun sight are coincident, the TD box is
removed, but the interrogation reply symbology is still displayed. The circle
or diamond is displayed while the interrogation sequence is in progress plus a
few seconds of overrun after the sequence is complete. The overrun is usually
2 - 5 seconds depending on what track mode the radar is in.

Deflection of the AAI interrogation switch twice within 1 second will change
the first BIT window character between “A” and “IT” to influence the
requirement for correlation (Figure D-7). In STT/DTT, only the “T” will be
displayed (STT always requires that the interrogation reply be correlated
with the STT target). If a “C” is associated with any mode (on the UFC) the
“T’ or “A” has no meaning and the interrogation, for that mode, will not
require correlation with a radar target (except when the radar is in
STT/DTT). For those modes with an “N” assigned on the UFC, including
mode 4, the “I” will impose the requirement for correlation, while the “A” will
delete the requirement for correlation (again except in STT/DTT).

Text from RDR-4_AAI_EID_Employment_page_21.jpeg:
If correlation is not required (and not accomplished), the reply symbology (an
open circle or diamond) is displayed at the range and azimuth of the replying
aircraft. Range is determined by the IRE alone, azimuth is determined by a
radar/IRE interface. If correlation is not required, but is achieved, the
correlated reply symbology is displayed at the radar target location (azimuth
and range). If correlation is required, only correlated reply symbology will be
displayed.

If during the same interrogation sequence a valid reply is followed by a valid
reply for another mode, the new symbology will replace the old, until replaced
by another valid reply, or until the interrogation is complete. For example, a
high confidence mode 4 reply symbol (circle) would be replaced by a mode 1, 2
or 3 reply symbol (diamond). A diamond replacing a diamond actually occurs,
but may not be discernable to the aircrew.

For search targets, correlated replies replace the radar target only for the
remainder of the duration of the interrogation sequence. In STT, the reply
symbology replaces (or more likely mipples with) the STT target symbol for
about 5 seconds. An important point is that in STT or DTT, and only in STT
or DTT, once correlation is achieved, the interrogation sequence stops. If you
were to have the radar in STT or DTT and attempted to interrogate your
leader’s mode 1 discrete correct code, the system would never look at mode 1
if it kept getting a correlated mode 4 reply. With all friendly aircraft
squawking mode 4, interrogating in STT or DTT would never provide you
with the discriminator that the STT or DTT target was indeed your leader.

In TWS, uncorrelated replies and replies correlated with search targets are
displayed as previously discussed. The PDT symbol mipples with the
correlated interrogation reply symbol for the duration of the interrogation
sequence plus 2 seconds overrun. In DTWS the interrogation sequence does
not stop with a correlated reply (like STT or DTT) but rather continues
through the UFC selected sequence. SDT symbols are replaced by reply
symbols for as long as they remain SDTs.

D-15 RDR-4


Text from RDR-4_AAI_EID_Employment_page_22.jpeg:
In STT, DTT and DTWS, the current ID status of the STT target or PDT is
displayed in the radar upper left corner, below the bearing/range information
and to the left of the target track data (TAS, aspect, heading) as a circle or
diamond. If the PDT is stepped to an SDT, which is already correlated with
an interrogation reply, the new PDT symbol mipples with its current ID
symbol and the upper left corner of the radar displays the new PDT ID
status. If the new PDT is not correlated with an interrogation reply, the
AUTO ID process (if selected) will initiate an interrogation sequence (or the
aircrew can manually initiate an interrogation sequence).

If a radar target is correlated with an interrogation reply (in other words it
has a current interrogation ID), placing the radar acquisition symbol over the
radar target symbol will recall the ID. (The ID symbol will replace or mipple
with the radar target as long as the acquisition symbol is coincident with the
radar target.)

EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS

The AAI/EID system seems complicated, more so than it really is, largely
because it provides so much flexibility in the cockpit.

Consider the following points:

@ Plan and brief how the system is to be used during a sortie. The Air
Tasking Order (ATO) for combat or a combat exercise will likely be very
specific on what is required from the system before a target can be
declared hostile and ordnance can be employed. Generally some other
criteria besides AAI will be required. Obviously, we would not shoot
circles or diamonds, but generally the absence of circles/diamonds plus
some other measure(s) (TEWS information, “Bandit” declaration by GCI,
etc.) would be required to shoot. A common set-up technique is to use the
AAT for station keeping (i.e., looking for codes within your flight/package),
and EID for lack of friendly.

@ During a trail departure/systems check, interrogate the preceding

aircraft’s IFF squawks to ensure both his IFF and your AAI are working.
It is best to interrogate the squawks one at a time and in correct code.

RDR-4 D-16


Text from RDR-4_AAI_EID_Employment_page_23.jpeg:
@ Ifyou have multiple modes selected for interrogating, consider selecting
only 2 bars. With all 4 AAI modes and 4 bars selected, the radar would
have to sweep 16 times to complete the interrogation sequence. In 120°
sweep (70°/sec scan rate), this would require almost 30 seconds. (With a
head aspect target and 1200 knots closure, the fighter-to-target range has
decreased by 10 miles). Two-bars per mode would cut the time in half.
STT or a narrower azimuth sweep will also reduce the time required to
complete an entire sequence. (Remember, in STT the interrogation
sequence stops with the first correlated reply.)

@ Ifyou are looking for a particular discrete squawk (correct code) consider
selecting just that mode. With multiple modes selected, it is often difficult
to tell which mode is giving you the reply symbology. Obviously, a circle is
a high confidence mode 4. But a diamond could be a mode 1, 2, 3 or low
confidence mode 4. Particularly in narrow sweep and two-bar
interrogation, the modes are interrogated quickly and it is often difficult
to match the reply with the information in the BIT window. In STT, the
interrogation is very fast. Each mode in 2-bar takes about 1.3 seconds.
The UFC and radar readouts for the mode currently being interrogated
change too fast to be useful.

@ The system not only helps you discriminate friendly from enemy or one
friendly from another friendly, but in the uncorrelated mode it also helps
you find the range and azimuth of a replying aircraft, so that you can use
a narrower azimuth scan and just concentrate on elevation to obtain a
radar target. You probably cannot overuse the system.

@ In STT or DTT, once the system correlates a valid reply with the radar
target, interrogation stops. If you were interrogating to get a mode 1
reply (probably correct code) to positively ID your flight lead and the STT
aircraft was replying to your mode 4 interrogation, you would never obtain
the desired mode 1 reply. In STT or DTT, even more than in other radar
modes, it is probably best to interrogate only the one mode if you are
looking for a discrete reply.

D-17 RDR-4


Text from RDR-4_AAI_EID_Employment_page_24.jpeg:
@ As you and your crewmate manipulate the interrogate switches, it is easy
to inadvertently change the A/I logic. Check the BIT window frequently
during interrogation sequences to ensure the appropriate A or I is
selected.

@ As well as the other purposes we have discussed, use AAI/EID for “see and
avoid.” For example, on a low level route, you could set the AAI to
interrogate mode 3-4000C (special use airspace military traffic) and the
EID to interrogate mode 3-1200C (VFR traffic; and special-use airspace
military traffic who forgot to change their squawk from M3-1200 to
M3-4000).

@ The AAI system has a big correlation window, and provides no correlation
in altitude/elevation. Just because the radar symbology shows an
interrogation reply symbol is correlated with a particular radar target, it
does not mean that the radar target and the replying aircraft are
definitely the same. It just means that they might be. Multiple
interrogations, from the time an intercept begins until just prior to
employing ordnance reduces the likelihood of a big mistake. Over time,
the aircraft providing the false ID would likely move out of the correlation
window. It is important to remember the absence or presence of
interrogation replies for a single interrogation does not complete the task.

Slaving

Slaving the AAI and EID settings to the current IFF settings is accomplished
by a scratchpad entry (“S”) into AAI (PB #8) on UFC Menu 1 or toggling AAT
SLV (PB #7) on the IFF submenu. Slaving can only be deselected on the IFF
submenu. When slaving is selected, “S” follows the selected AAI modes
displayed on UFC Menu 1. When slaving is selected, each time the IFF
system changes to a new phase (IFF phasing), both the AAI and EID (modes
1 through 3) change to mimic the IFF (which modes are selected and the
codes associated with modes 1 and 3). Slaving does not affect mode 4 and
does not affect the mode 2 code, only whether mode 2 is selected or
deselected. When slaving is selected, an aircrew manual change to the IFF
(modes 1 through 3) causes the AAI and EID selections to mimic the changes
made to the IFF. When an IFF change (phasing or manually) is implemented
to the AAI/EID system, it changes the affected mode to correct code (C). If
the aircrew desires mode-only interrogation [(N) for modes 1 through 3] or
correlated-only interrogation [(N) for modes 1 through 4], the AAI/EID
settings would have to be reset following the change (phasing or manual).
Hence, although slaving has value in some situations, the aircrew must
realize the impacts.

TEXT
INTRODUCTION

The F-15 air-to-air interrogator (AAI) set hardware is largely unchanged
since the Eagle’s inception. However, due to software changes, AAI system
capabilities have evolved significantly over the years. The current F-15E AAI
system software (and radar software) provides significantly improved
flexibility and ease of use/interpretation.

However, the overall system still exhibits characteristics and anomalies,
which, if not fully understood by the user, can adversely affect results and
aircrew interpretation. The consequences could range from rejoining on the
wrong aircraft to fratriciding a friendly aircraft in combat.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

The aircrew utilizes the UFC to select how the interrogation is to be
implemented, and switchology (both A/A radar and AAI) to influence the
conduct of the interrogation. The progress of the interrogation is displayed
on the UFC and A/A radar and the results are displayed on the A/A or A/G
radar and the HUD. The AAI provides the radar with interrogation
information and the radar is responsible for processing the AAI hardware
inputs, so that they are visually displayed to the aircrew (on the radar
display and HUD).

AAI Components

The IFF reply evaluator (IRE) is the main unit of the system. It is located on
the right side of the aircraft’s nose (in door 3R). It provides generation of
interrogations (based on aircrew selections), reply evaluation and radar
interface functions. The radar provides the IRE with information required to
produce interrogation and process replies, including radar mode, scan rates
and antenna azimuth position. The IRE monitors AAI system failures and
LRU (line replaceable unit) status and provides inputs to the aircraft BIT
system.

The IFF interrogator receiver/transmitter (R/T) is also located in door 3R. It
contains a power select switch, which is a holdover from previous versions.
(The R/T represents the only significant hardware change). The F-15E R/T
always uses maximum power, regardless of the switch setting. There are two
separate receivers.

D-1 RDR-4


Text from RDR-4_AAI_EID_Employment_page_8.jpeg:
The Interrogator Computer (KIR) produces mode 4 interrogations, decodes
mode 4 replies and determines their validity. It is also located in door 3R.

The AAI dipole array is part of the radar antenna, composed of ten L-band
dipoles mounted on the antenna face and cabling/hardware on the back of the
main radar antenna.

OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS
Normal (N) Versus Correct Code (C) Interrogations

Whether interrogation is normal or correct code is determined by aircrew
selections on the UFC (an N or C adjacent to the selected mode/code on the
AAI/EID submenus), and whether the interrogation is for modes 1 thru 3 or
for mode 4. For modes 1 thru 3, the aircrew can determine, through the UFC
selection, whether only replies that are correct in both mode and code will be
displayed on the radar (C), or whether mode replies will be displayed, even if
the code does not match the UFC code setting (N). For mode 4, the N or C
next to mode 4 on the UFC has no meaning with respect to normal or correct
code interrogation; mode 4 always requires a correct code (4 A or 4 B) reply,
or the reply symbology will not be displayed. The mode 4 selection of N or C
does have meaning, however, with respect to correlated versus noncorrelated
interrogation.

Correlated Versus Noncorrelated Interrogation

The aircrew can select to have interrogation replies displayed on the radar
that are not correlated with a radar target (symbol). The advantage of this
method of interrogation is that it provides the azimuth and range of aircraft
that might be of interest to the aircrew. The aircrew can then manipulate
the radar (azimuth scan volume, PRF, altitude coverage, etc.) to obtain the
corresponding radar target. Alternatively, the aircrew can select to have
interrogation replies displayed on the radar only if they are correlated with a
radar target (symbol). The advantage of this method of interrogation is that
the aircrew is not encumbered by replies outside the area of interest being
searched by the radar. For example, an aircrew flying at 500 feet may not be
interested in aircraft flying at 50,000 feet. The aircrew can select, via FCP
HOTAS/RCP hand controller switchology whether an I (Interrogate) or an A
(All) is displayed as the first character in the radar BIT window, while an
interrogation is in progress. By selecting “A” in the radar BIT window, the
aircrew deletes the requirement for correlation for all interrogation modes
with “N” selected on the UFC. By selecting “I” in the radar BIT window, the
aircrew imposes the requirement for correlation for all interrogation modes

RDR-4 D-2


Text from RDR-4_AAI_EID_Employment_page_9.jpeg:
with “N” selected on the UFC. All modes with “C” selected on the UFC do not
require correlation, regardless of the “A/I” setting displayed in the radar BIT
window. However, STT or DTT always require correlation with the STT or
PDT target, regardless of the UFC “N or C” setting. During interrogations
with the radar in STT or DTT, the radar BIT window will only display “I”
regardless of aircrew actions.

If an interrogation reply cannot be correlated with a radar target and the
aircrew selections require correlation (or the radar is in STT or DTT), the
reply symbology will not be displayed. Even if the aircrew has selected that
interrogation reply symbology be displayed without correlation with a radar
target, the system will correlate (and show correlated symbology) if able, but
will also display uncorrelated reply symbology.

Correlation Window

When correlation with a radar target is required for radar display of
interrogation reply symbology, the correlation requirements are normally +4°
(but possibly as much as +8°) in azimuth and +2 nm in range (for a HPRF
target) or +8000 feet in range (for a MPRF target). There is no correlation
requirement in elevation. Incidentally, although interrogation reply symbols
will be displayed only within the current radar display range and the
azimuth limits of the current radar sweep, the elevation capability of the AAI
dipole antennas is much larger than the elevation coverage of the radar’s
main antenna. The dipole antennas cover a 35° cone centered on the radar
main antenna elevation. For example, in six-bar RWS at 25 nm the radar
altitude coverage is 20,000 feet, but the AAI coverage is about 87,500 feet. If
correlation is not required, the interrogation replies from aircraft well outside
the normal radar altitude coverage will be displayed. Regardless of whether
correlation is required or not, a valid reply from an aircraft well above or
below a radar target (but meeting range and azimuth correlation
requirements) will be correlated with that radar target.

Although the radar and IRE work together to determine the azimuth of the
interrogation reply, the IRE alone determines the range of the reply and
neither the radar nor the IRE assesses the altitude. Again, even though the
aircrew has made selections that delete the requirement for correlation, if the
radar/IRE determine the interrogation reply meets the range/azimuth
correlation criteria with a target in radar memory, they will perform the
correlation and the aircrew will view correlated symbology on the air-to-air
radar. Because the correlation window is so large, it is commonly referred to
as the “correlation phone booth” and the aircrew must be keenly aware that
replies from one aircraft can be correlated with a different radar target.

AIR COMBAT COMMAND


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_10.jpeg:
Obviously, for any given scan rate, the frame time is inversely
proportional to the frame’s azimuth and elevation parameters. Sixty
degree azimuth scan provides one half the frame time of 120° azimuth
scan; 2-bar elevation scan provides one half the frame time of 4-bar. Let
us look at a few data points, remembering that for interleaved pulse
repetition frequency (IPRF) search, 2 frames are required to insure both
medium pulse repetition frequency (MPRF) and high pulse repetition
frequency (HPRF) coverage of the entire search volume.

Frame Time and Range Scale Selection

Range while search (RWS) provides a faster scan rate at short range (90°
per second on the 10 nm or 20 nm range scale) where a faster refresh rate
is more important. The longer display ranges (40,80 or 160 nm range
scales) provide a slower scan rate (longer dwell time). Six-bar/120°
azimuth on the longer range scales provides a frame time of about 10
seconds. Two frames (required for IPRF) take about 20 seconds. At the
shorter ranges you would likely be using 60° azimuth and MPRF (so that
only one frame is required). This situation provides a four second frame
time.

Frame Time and Mode Selection

Range gated high (RGH) and track-while-scan (TWS) use this same logic,
providing slower or faster scan rates, depending on range scale selection.
RGH uses a PRF lower than RWS HPRF, so it uses a slower scan rate (for
longer dwell time) and hence a longer frame time than RWS (for the same
search volume). TWS, at longer ranges, needs a slower scan rate (50°/sec)
because of the additional processing time it requires, but keeps the frame
time acceptable by using smaller search volumes. Note that HDTWS

(2- or 3-bar/30°) provides a fast frame time for quickly building track files
and refreshing maneuvering targets, attributes usually desirable during
the sorting process. Lastly, note that (search) sort (30° azimuth scan)
pairs elevation bar scans with ranges to provide appropriate altitude
coverage (more elevation bars on the shorter range scales) while it
provides fast frame times, desirable during the sorting process.

Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_12.jpeg:
In the search modes [(RWS, RGH, velocity search (VS) and vector (VCTR)]
the elevation bar selection is at aircrew discretion. The radar designers
provided for wider angular elevation coverage at shorter range scales (to
ensure sufficient altitude coverage) by increasing the bar spacing in all
modes except VCTR.

Although the radar altitude coverage (at the acquisition symbol range)
can be determined directly from the radar (digital readout at the
acquisition symbol and the altitude coverage circles), still consider the
following rules of thumb (RWS, RGH, VS, VCTR), based on range scale
selection.

Figure D - 4. Elevation Coverage Rules of Thumb.

Hence, during long range search with 6-bar elevation scan, the altitude
coverage at 25 nm from the aircraft would be 20,000 feet.

Another method for computing altitude coverage at a given range is:
e >40nm display range: (bars + 2 x range x 100)
e = [(6+ 2) x 25 x 100] = 8 x 25 x 100 = 20,000 ft

e 20nm display range: (bars + 2 x scribe number x 100)

Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_14.jpeg:
Even experienced aviators return to this concept over and over, albeit
sometimes subconsciously. With experience, the tasks become more
second nature. The beginner, however, should constantly ask: “What, at
this moment, am I trying to accomplish and am I using the appropriate
radar modes and radar options to best achieve the results I want, under
the current set of circumstances?” These tasks are commonly referred to
as the S’s for success. They are search, sample, sanitize, sort, shoot, and
short range. “Survive” is frequently added between shoot and short range.
Shoot, survive and short range will be addressed in great detail during the
air-to-air weapons (AAW) and air-to-air maneuvering (AAM) workbooks,
lectures and CBT lessons. For now, we will limit the discussion to search,
sample, sanitize and sort.

Search

This task involves finding an aircraft (target). In a patrol situation, the
aircrew searches a desired (or assigned) volume of airspace. In a multi
aircraft formation the larger volume of airspace is usually divided among
the aircraft as a function of altitude at a given range. For example,
members of a two ship formation may search surface to 20,000 feet at 25
miles and 18,000 to 38,000 at 25 miles. With no information about
possible targets, the search is generally performed in 120° azimuth scan
and 40 or 80 mile radar range scale.

Sample

The objective of sampling is to obtain all the information you can about a
particular target or targets so you can decide upon the best course of
action to achieve the desired results. Desired information includes
altitude, airspeed, heading and aspect. You will maneuver your
aircraft/formation based on this information. Sampling is generally
accomplished using a radar track mode, like single target track (STT),
dual target track (DTT), or designated track-while-scan (DTWS).
Highlight can also be used for sampling because it provides track
information, but it is generally considered a search (vice track) mode.

RDR-5 D-8


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_15.jpeg:
Sanitize

With the sampled target information in hand, use the radar’s search
capabilities to determine if there are other aircraft or groups of aircraft in
addition to the originally sampled target or target formation. Sample any
new radar targets. You may periodically resample previous targets, as
you need more information about target maneuvering or the progress of
the intercept. Deciding which target/formation is of primary concern is
referred to as targeting.

Sort

Sorting is the process of determining how many aircraft are in a formation
(group) and the spatial relationships of the targets to one another. In
classic terminology “the sort” involves ensuring members of your
formation employ ordnance against different members of the target
formation. “The sort” is generally accomplished at a range that is
mutually understood by members of the attacking formation (and just
prior to employing ordnance).

SEARCH

Range-While-Search (RWS)

RWS is the most widely used search mode because of the variety of
available options (particularly medium, high and interleaved PRF) and

the flexibility of elevation bar and azimuth scan, 120/60 and 30 (search
sort).

Figure D - 7. Search Cues in RWS.

Initially, the aircrew should ensure that the briefed (or appropriate) long
range search (LRS) is selected (40 nm or 80 nm range, INLV, 6-bar
elevation scan, 120° azimuth scan). The aircrew sets the acquisition
symbols at the briefed/appropriate range (commonly 25 nm) and sets the
antenna elevation to provide the desired altitude coverage. If the bar scan
does not cover the required altitude, the aircrew must manually move the
antenna elevation. For example, if surface to 30,000 feet coverage is
required while the 6-bar elevation scan covers only 20,000 feet, the
aircrew can alternate coverage of surface to 20,000 then 10,000 to 30,000.
While using INLV, two frames (20 seconds if 6-bar/120° sweep) are
required before changing the antenna elevation. As the radar searches,
the aircrew can use AAI/EID to detect the presence of a target. If GCI
calls a target, maneuver the aircraft so the GCI reference is within the
azimuth search volume. Using the GCI provided information, the aircrew
can decrease the elevation bars and azimuth scan and select MED or HI
PREF (if appropriate) to help the radar find the target more quickly.

RDR-5 D-10


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_17.jpeg:
Place the acquisition symbols at the GCI referenced (or AAI/EID) location
and center the elevation/azimuth coverage on the target location. Once
the radar target appears, even the search cues will provide a lot of
“sample information.”

Placing the acquisition symbols over the target provides a better idea of
target altitude (coffin and digital readout) and digital readouts of target
relative bearing/range and bullseye bearing/range. Further sample the
target, if desired, by entering a track mode, but regardless, when
returning to search, be sure to reset the search radar parameters.
LRS/SRS switchology will reset display range, elevation bar and PRF to
the memorized settings.

The aircrew must manually reset the azimuth sweep and reset the
altitude coverage by placing the acquisition symbol at the appropriate
range and resetting the antenna elevation.

As you review the search target symbology (Figure D-8) remember that
four radar hits are required for the radar to upgrade targets to vectored
track files.

RDR-5 D-12


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_19.jpeg:
In MED search or RGH, both hot or cold symbology is available and the
radial closure requirement is 200 knots (positive for hot symbology and
negative for cold symbology). In RWS and medium range missile (MRM)
selected with the FCP weapons select switch, upgraded TWS background
processing is available which can display upgraded hot/cold symbology in
the form of filled-in rectangles with short heading vectors, like TWS
nondesignated target symbols. If RWS, range gated high, or vector scan
search modes are entered from TWS or STT, the radar retains the TWS or
STT track files as background track files [the nondesignated
track-while-scan (NDTWS) symbology]. Up to 10 TWS background
targets can be displayed and are aged out using normal track file deletion
logic. In short, hot/cold search forces the radar to provide target heading
information faster than you might otherwise have it. Only two hits are
required for hot/cold symbology, but four correlated hits are required for
vectored rectangle symbology.

Range Gated High (RGH)

RGH is selected by boxing RGH at PB #7. It is designed to provide a
longer range all-aspect capability using smaller range bins and slower
scan rates than RWS for improved range resolution (even better than
MPRF RWS) and improved long range, all aspect tracking capability.
Overall, it is mechanized and utilized much like RWS (display ranges,
elevation bars, frame store, azimuth scans, target symbology, etc.) but
using a fixed PRF which is between RWS medium PRF and high PRF. It
works like MPRF, in that it provides both hot and cold target symbology.
Search cues and target symbology are like RWS (Figures D-7, D-8, and
D-9) except there is no range limited target capability. RGH ignores the
radar ground moving target reject (GMTR) setting and uses a fixed 88
knot beam notch (like GMTR HI). Range scale selections greater than 40
nm use HPRF-like power, long pulse and a 50°/second scan rate (for long
range detection). The 10 nm and 20 nm range scales use short pulse and
a 70° scan rate (for more accurate ranging and faster frame times for
maneuvering targets).

feet AGL (and reenters RGH when above 4,500 feet AGL). Against frontal
targets, RGH has a shorter detection range than RWS-HI, but longer than
RWS-MED. Detection range against tail targets with opening velocity is
comparable to RWS-MED, but shorter against tail targets with no closure
(or opening velocity). RGH might be beneficial if the radar has high or
medium PRF malfunctions or against low aspect targets at longer ranges,
but generally its liabilities outweigh its advantages compared to RWS.

If RGH is selected and the aircrew selects TWS, the radar continues to use
the RGH waveform. If a track mode (STT, DTT) is entered with RGH
selected, the radar returns to RGH search when the radar exits track
(breaks lock or the aircrew mode rejects to search).

Velocity Search (VS)

VS is entered by “boxing” PB #8 on the radar display. It presents targets
in an azimuth/radial closure format, instead of the normal azimuth/range
format.

VS provides no target altitude or target range information. It is very
susceptible to false targets (birds) particularly at low altitude or with
look-down situations. The scope range is provided only for assessing radar
altitude coverage (at the acquisition symbol range), and both the altitude
coverage circles and digital altitude coverage are provided. Hot/cold
target symbology and AAI/EID capability are not available, nor is bullseye
bearing and range (BBR).

By locking the target, the aircrew can obtain track capability with an
allowable steering error (ASE) circle and steering dot that provide pure
pursuit steering (to put the target on the fighter’s nose). In VS track, no
other track information including weapons cues are provided. When the
radar is able, it will enter full STT and provide normal STT track and
weapons information. The aircrew needs to remember that with a return
to search from track entered from VS (even STT) the radar returns to VS.
If the aircrew desires RWS, they must manually select it.

RDR-5 D-14


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_21.jpeg:
Although VS provides only minimal target detection range improvement
over RWS-HI, VS track along with GCI provided target information
(range, heading, altitude) can aid in the successful employment of
weapons against a very high and fast target.

This concludes our discussion concerning searching for a target.
RWS-INLYV is the most useful and most used search mode because of its
flexibility and all aspect capabilities. RGH, VS and VCTR [see the RDR-6
workbook or TO 1F-F15E-34-1-1-1 (classified) for VCTR] are less flexible
and generally less useful except under special circumstances.

MODES USED FOR SAMPLING

Although a great deal of target information can be determined in the
search modes, particularly RWS, by tracking the target in the sample
modes the radar provides more accurate target information plus
additional target information in the forms of target altitude, true airspeed
(TAS), aspect, heading, intercept steering and weapons employment
information (the weapons employment zone or “WEZ”). Sample (track)
modes include STT, DTT, DTWS and highlight.

Single Target Track (STT)

The advantage of STT is that it provides the best, purest and most reliable
information to the aircrew (and to medium range missiles—
AIM-7/AIM-120). Its disadvantage is that it renders the radar (and the
aircrew) blind to any other targets, and is the mode most likely to provide
the target with the best cockpit warning. Figure D-10 shows the track
cues available in most track modes.

Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_23.jpeg:
The acquisition symbol is available in all the track modes, but in STT it is
only displayed with MRM selected on the FCP weapons select switch. In
STT (MRM) the acquisition symbol allows the aircrew to bump out to
increase the range scale. In the other track modes the acquisition symbol
allows the aircrew to “bump” to change azimuth scan or range (in or out).

From STT, if the radar itself breaks lock or the aircrew returns to search,
last track data is displayed at the upper left of the grid scale, as altitude
and aspect (vice TAS, aspect and heading while in track). This last track
data is displayed for 10 seconds or until a track mode is entered,
whichever happens first. The new track data takes precedence over the
last track data. Whenever the radar exits track, the radar antenna
remains at the last track elevation until the aircrew manually moves the
elevation or returns it to level (FCP weapons switch to guns; RCP auto
acquisition switch forward or aft). An exit from STT to a search mode
clears the target. The radar must gather the information required to
display the previously tracked target (and any other targets) as
observation, confirmed, hot/cold, vectored track files or range limited
targets.

Track-While-Scan (TWS)

For a scanning radar, the target update data rate depends on the frame
time, which determines the time between consecutive illuminations of a
specific point in space. Tracking of several targets becomes largely a
matter of sorting target hits obtained in each radar frame and assigning
them to proper target tracks. These tracks form the basis of estimating
future target positions until the target data can be refreshed. The process
of tracking targets based on discrete radar information obtained while the
radar continues to scan a search volume is referred to as track-while-scan
(TWS) and is accomplished in the digital computer.

D-17 RDR-5


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_24.jpeg:
TWS offers the advantages of a hybrid search/track capability. In
nondesignated TWS the aircrew has the advantage of full range of motion
in azimuth and elevation of the selected TWS scan pattern. In designated
TWS (DTWS) the aircrew has the advantage of having the radar keep
track of a selected target [the primary designated target (PDT)], but the
aircrew has only limited ability to position the TWS azimuth scan pattern
and limited (and in some cases no) ability to position the TWS scan
pattern in elevation. TWS has less flexibility than RWS, because it
marries an elevation bar scan and an azimuth scan, rather than
elevation/azimuth being individually selectable by the aircrew. The
aircrew selected range, GMTR and PRF (including RGH) are utilized in
TWS, however the elevation bar setting is ignored until TWS is exited.
The TWS abbreviations can be confusing. “IT'WS” is understood as normal,
vice High Data (HDTWS). TWS and HDTWS can be nondesignated
(“ND’TWS/”ND”’HDTWS) although the “ND” is normally used only when a
distinction is required between nondesignated and designated TWS. TWS
and HDTWS can be designated (DTWS/DHDTWS). Finally, TWS sort can
be a submode of all the above (Normal/High Data - TWS Sort/HDTWS
Sort) and designated or nondesignated (TWS Sort, DTWS Sort, HDTWS
Sort, DHDTWS Sort).

TWS offers the following advantages:
e Multi target detection
e Multi target track (DTWS)
e Rapid target altitude sampling (DTWS)
e Possible reduced target RWR (vice other track modes)
e STT-like data on the Primary Designated Target (DTWS)

e Sets of scan volumes (elevation/azimuth): 2-bar/60°, 4-bar/30°,
6-bar/15°

e Plan view of target formations (DTWS)

e High data mode for maneuvering targets (HDTWS): 2-bar/30°
or 3-bar/30°

e Established track files beyond display range are maintained

e INLV PRF is mechanized based on display range in TWS or PDT
range in DTWS

RDR-5 D-18


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_25.jpeg:
TWS induces the following limitations:
e Track data is not STT (or DTT) quality

e Elevation/azimuth scan sets can limit search flexibility
(particularly in designated TWS)

e Slower AAI/EID capability versus STT/DTT (no AAI/EID
capability in Narrow—6-bar/15°)

e Susceptible to target maneuvering, particularly at closer target
range

TWS HOTAS

TWS can be entered from any search mode except VS, including visual
auto acquisition modes except guns search, and from any track mode
except VS track. If entered from a search mode, the radar enters
nondesignated TWS. If entered from a track mode, the radar enters
designated TWS (DTWS).

The following addresses TWS entry switchology:
e From search:

e miniraster (over space) + auto acquisition switch forward
enters HDTWS (forward < 1 second enters 3-bar/30°;
forward > 1 second enters 2-bar/30°)

e  miniraster + auto acquisition switch aft enters TWS

e From track (STT, DTT, or Highlight):

e auto acquisition switch forward enters DHDTWS
(< 1 second for 3-bar; > 1 second for 2-bar)
e auto acquisition switch aft enters DTWS

e InTWS:

e Auto acquisition switch forward selects HDTWS
(> 1 second/< 1 second logic)

e 3-bar HDTWS and auto acquisition forward < 1 second
enters 4-bar/30° TWS

e Azimuth bump to 2-bar/60° TWS or 4-bar/30° TWS

D-19 RDR-5


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_26.jpeg:
Figure D-11 shows nondesignated TWS symbology, which can be
displayed in either designated or nondesignated TWS [the radar priority
target (closed star) is applicable to nondesignated TWS only].

The aircrew selectable frame store and elevation bar selection are not
used in TWS; the aircrew selected frame store and elevation bar setting
will be used when TWS is exited to other modes where they are used.

Half intensity observation targets are deleted if they do not receive
another hit within the next frame (4 to 5 seconds) in TWS or three frames
(about 3 seconds) in HDTWS. Deletion of confirmed range (full intensity,
nonvectored symbols) occurs if an update does not occur within three
frames (6 to 8 seconds) in TWS or four frames (4 seconds) in HDTWS. For
observation or range only targets, there is no symbol flashing prior to
deletion.

Established vectored track file targets are deleted (if they are not
updated) using target range logic. Targets between 10 and 20 nm range
flash after 11 seconds, flash for 4 seconds and are deleted at 15 seconds.
Targets, at all other ranges flash after 6 seconds (for 4 seconds) and are
deleted at 10 seconds. The longer 15 second deletion times for 10 to 20 nm
range targets is for AMRAAM data link support and for maneuvering
target considerations.

Track files will not be generated beyond the selected range scale, but
existing track files will be maintained if the range scale is bumped to a
lesser range where they are not displayed. These range limited track files
will be maintained in accordance with the TWS track file update/deletion
logic. Remember, TWS does not automatically range in (or out) as the
target range changes (like STT does). The aircrew must bump the range
as required.

DTWS Symbology

DTWS target symbology (Figure D-12) is the same as NDTWS symbology
with the following exceptions. There is no radar priority target (RPT
closed star) in DTWS. Instead there is a primary designated target
(PDT—Open star). In DTWS there can be up to 7 secondary designated
targets (SDT—open box with long heading vectors). If DTWS is entered
from a track mode (STT, DTT) or Highlight the tracked target becomes
the PDT.

The aircrew can designate additional track files as SDT’s either manually
or using the auto designation feature by boxing auto at PB #10 on a TWS

radar display. The auto designation feature works only after the radar is
in DTWS.

RDR-5 D - 22


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_29.jpeg:
NDTWS to DTWS Switchology
The aircrew can enter DTWS from TWS (DHDTWS from HDTWS) by:
e Manually designating a track file Gncluding the RPT)

@ Quickstep (FCP coolie up/RCP castle depress < 1 second). The
RPT becomes the PDT.

NDTWS Versus DTWS

The advantage of NDTWS is that the TWS search volume can be
positioned to the radar elevation and azimuth limits. The disadvantage is
that any TWS targets (including the RPT) left uncovered will be lost if
they are not refreshed. The advantage of DTWS is that the aircrew
cannot move the search volume off the PDT. Obviously, the disadvantage
is that this limits the aircrew’s ability to position the TWS search volume.
AIM-120 AMRAAM launch requires DTWS; the missile is launched to the
PDT. Another advantage of DTWS is that via quickstep (less than one
second) the aircrew can step (range order) among the SDT’s making each
one the PDT, in turn. As the PDT is stepped to each SDT, the target and
missile information on the DTWS display is applicable to the current PDT.
Hence, the SDT’s can be quickly sampled for desired information.

TWS auto designation follows this logic:
e Auto appears at PB #10 when TWS is entered
e Itis unboxed at radar power up
e Itis nonfunctional until at least one target is designated

e Ifboxed, once DTWS is entered, up to seven track files will be
automatically designated

e Ifthe PDT (or any SDT) is manually undesignated, it will
remain undesignated until manually redesignated (or AUTO is
unboxed, then boxed again). The manual undesignating
switchology is (with the acquisition symbol over the target) FCP
boat switch aft/RCP castle switch left.

TWS Cues

In addition to the target symbology (observation targets, confirmed range
targets, hot/cold targets, track files, RPT, PDT, SDT’s) much of the same
type information available in RWS is available in TWS. (Figure D-12).

RDR-05-12

Figure D - 18. Nondesignated TWS (NDTWS) Target Symbology.

The digital altitude search volume is shown at the elevation coverage
circles, rather than at the acquisition symbol. A sampled target provides
an elevation coffin and the digital target altitude/ nonstandard mach on
the left and right of the acquisition symbol, respectively. (The PDT
altitude is displayed at the elevation caret, and is not displayed at the
acquisition symbol, when the PDT is sampled.)

In NDTWS, the BRA and BBR use search logic; both are to the acquisition
symbol. In DTWS the BRA and BBR are to the PDT.

RDR-5 D - 24


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_31.jpeg:
DTWS Elevation Control

In 2- or 3-bar DTWS the radar antenna elevation is locked to the PDT; the
aircrew has no control of the radar elevation.

In 4- or 6-bar designated TWS, full elevation deflection of the elevation
control up or down centers the PDT between the bottom two bars or top
two bars. While biased, a “U” or “D” replaces the selected elevation scan
in the BIT window (UTWS) to alert the crew to the up or down bias.
While biased, full deflection of elevation control returns the elevation scan
to normal logic by centering the target in the TWS elevation bar scan.
Selecting a new PDT also removes the bias. The elevation coverage circles
and digital altitude coverage change to reflect the up, down, or centered
elevation scan. When the radar determines that a TWS target is
approaching the vertical limits of the search volume, an up or down caret
will be displayed at the target location to tell the aircrew which way to
bias the search volume in an attempt to reacquire the target.

TWS Search Volumes and Parameters

The TWS search volume sets (2-bar/60°, 4-bar/30°, 6-bar/15°) and two
HDTWS sets provide volumes to quickly accommodate various formations,
particularly as formations close in range and greater altitude coverage is
needed. The FCP weapons select switch or RCP castle, when used to
select LRS/SRS parameters, do not change the TWS range. They do not
change the TWS elevation bars (but change the displayed setting). They
do function in changing the PRF to the LRS/SRS memorized settings.

TWS Elevation Coverage

Remember the previous discussion concerning altitude coverage in RWS:

>40 RANGE 20 RANGE 10 RANGE
2-bar 350 ft/nm 500 ft/nm 600 ft/nm
4-bar 600 ft/nm 1000 ft/nm 1300 ft/nm
6-bar 800 ft/nm 1600 ft/nm 2000 ft/nm

D - 25 RDR-5


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_32.jpeg:
While RWS varies the bar spacing for different range scale (1°, 2.5°, 3.4°),
TWS uses 1.5° bar spacing on all range scales, which provides the
following altitude coverages:

2-bar/60° 400 ft/nm ( 4°/nm)
3-bar/30° 500 ft/nm ( 5°/nm)
4-bar/30° 700 ft/nm ( 7°/nm)
6-bar/15° 1000 ft/nm (10°/nm)

At the target ranges that TWS is normally employed, a 40 nm range scale
is generally used. TWS provides about 15 to 25 percent more altitude
coverage than 40 nm RWS.

TWS provides the ability to rapidly transition among established search
volumes. If targets maneuver outside the current TWS search volume,
the aircrew can quickly and easily select a more suitable search volume by
azimuth bumping between 30° and 60° TWS, by “designating NARROW”
in the BIT window to enter 15° TWS or by using HOTAS to select HDTWS
(2- or 3-bar/30°).

High Data TWS (HDTWS)

HDTWS provides a 2- or 3-bar/30° scan pattern with a 65° per second scan
rate in all range scales which results in a one second frame time. The fast
frame time provides faster target updates, and therefore better capability
for maneuvering targets. The 2-bar 1.5° bar spacing provides 4° of
elevation coverage, the same as 2-bar/60° normal TWS, which gives us 400
feet per nm of altitude coverage, or about 8,000-12,000 feet at usual sort
ranges.

You will remember the switchology—entering TWS, auto acquisition

switch forward enters HDTWS (vice aft for TWS). As with TWS, auto
acquisition switch aft enters STT on the RPT or PDT.

RDR-5 D - 26


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_33.jpeg:
Dual Target Track (DTT)

DTT (Figure D-14) is really more applicable to the shoot phase than the
sampling phase. It was originally envisioned as a capability for employing
AIM-7 missiles at multiple targets. Once tested, it was found to be
incapable of providing enough information to the missiles at end game and
was subsequently fielded as an AIM-120 only mode. The aircrew enters
DTT by redesignating an SDT (for > 1 second) in any DTWS mode. DTT
does not scan, in the normal sense. It simply alternates a miniraster
between the two targets (the PDT and SDT). It can track targets
separated by as much as 45° in azimuth and 30° in elevation. The radar
will only see additional targets if they are inside the scan volume of one of
the minirasters. If the spacing between the two targets exceeds the DTT
limits (45° in azimuth or 30° in elevation) the radar exits DTT to DTWS
on the PDT. The aircrew can exit DTT as follows:

e Undesignate a DTT target - to DTWS with the remaining DTT
target as the PDT

e Auto acquisition switch forward - DTWS
e Auto acquisition switch aft - STT on PDT

e Mode reject (or designate space) - selected search mode

SANITIZE RWS

The only pure sanitize mode is RWS INLV, 120° scan and set to cover the

appropriate area of responsibility in altitude. Other modes, such as TWS

(particularly nondesignated TWS) and Highlight, offer some capability to

accomplish a degree of sanitizing, while the aircrew is performing another
radar task, but these modes should not be used, as a matter of course, for

sanitizing.

Highlight

Another of these multifunctional hybrid modes is highlight. The
advantage of highlight over TWS is that the altitude and azimuth scans
are individually selected by the aircrew, rather than mechanized in sets,
asin TWS. The major disadvantage of Highlight is a slow refresh rate
which induces inaccuracies in the track information.

Figure D-14 shows the switchology to enter highlight. No weapon
employment cues are provided until the target is upgraded to a track file.

Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_36.jpeg:
In essence, entry into highlight forces the radar to work harder to achieve
vector status (a track file) on the highlighted target. It performs as many
minirasters as required to achieve vector status (four updates). On initial
entry, if vector status is not achieved after 7.5 seconds, the highlight
attempt is aborted and the radar returns to RWS. Note that highlight can
only be entered from RWS with MRM selected on the FCP weapons select
switch.

While in highlight, the radar scans the aircrew selectable search volume.
If the highlighted target is not updated during the regular search scan,
the radar enters the miniraster as necessary to update the highlighted
target. The highlighted target and up to nine additional track files can be
displayed. Azimuth bumping is normal and the acquisition symbol
returns to the highlighted target. Highlight is exited to RWS if MRM is
exited, if the radar range is bumped to less than the highlighted target
range, or if the aircrew selects a search mode other than RWS. As the
radar enters search, no last track data is provided, and the radar targets
are maintained. The aircrew can enter RWS with mode reject, high data
TWS with auto acquisition forward, normal TWS (not STT) with auto
acquisition aft, or STT with manual lock on.

In summary, highlight can be used to get TWS-like information, including
target track data while searching a flexible search volume. Like TWS it
may deny RWR information. Highlight can be used to sample and search
with WEZ information to determine when to enter a weapons employment
radar mode. In highlight, AMRAAMs employ as a visual launch and
AIM-7s go FLOOD. Do not shoot from highlight. AAI/EID is available in
highlight.

SORTING

You will remember that sorting is the process of distinguishing individual
targets within a formation. The final sort is the process of entering a
track mode on a particular target for weapon employment on that target
(STT/PDT).

Sorting is often a compromise between maintaining big picture SA with
sufficient search volume to encompass the targeted formation (including
maneuvering targets) and consideration for fast frame time for quick
updates on maneuvering targets and radar time on target, sufficient to
break out closely spaced targets in azimuth.

RDR-5 D - 30


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_37.jpeg:
Sorting can be accomplished from search modes like RWS and RGH, and
from hybrid search/track modes like TWS. RWS, medium PRF with 60°
azimuth scan and the smallest elevation scan practical for the tactical
situation is the most commonly used option. This discussion will cover the
search sort and TWS sort modes.

Sort (Figure D-17) can be entered from all search modes or STT with the
action switch (FCP TDC or RCP trigger for > 1 second). Sort is entered
with a return to search from the visual auto acquisition modes (except
auto guns) or with a return to search from STT or flood, but only if these
modes were entered from sort. Sort entry from scanning modes initializes
the 30° scan centered at the acquisition symbol. Entry from STT
initializes the 30° scan centered at the STT target.

D-31 RDR-5


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_38.jpeg:
The scan is space stabilized so that as the aircraft turns, the scan
continues to search the same airspace volume rather than the same
relative bearing from the aircraft. If the scan pattern becomes antenna
azimuth limited, it remains there as azimuth bump does not occur. The
30° scan is aircrew slewable at all times and an aircrew initiated azimuth
bump causes entry to 60° search.

Figure D - 18. Sort Logic.

Where TWS marries elevation bars to azimuth scans, search sort marries
elevation bars to range scale selections (Figure D-18). A weapon select
switch change or rear cockpit long range search/short range search change
will change the PRF and range scale, but sort mode continues to use its
own elevation scan logic, rather than that programmed against the
switches. Once in the sort mode, the aircrew can override sort mode’s
elevation logic with a manual elevation bar change, but a subsequent
range scale change will reinitialize the sort mode elevation scan logic
(based on the new range scale). Note that the bar spacing and elevation
coverage on a 40 nm range scale is dependent on acquisition symbol
placement (another reason to put the acquisition at the range, or
suspected range of the target).

RDR-5 D - 32


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_39.jpeg:
Sort can be exited to the selected search mode, to TWS, to STT, or to the
visual modes with the same logic as from normal 120° or 60° search.
Azimuth bump in sort enters the 60° azimuth scan, in the selected search
mode.

Search sort is compatible with RWS, RGH and velocity search.

Figure D - 19. Sort Considerations.

Let us look at some sorting considerations (Figure D-19). Consider sorting
at 25 nm ona 40 nm range scale. First, use the smallest practical
elevation bar to decrease frame time. One benefit of faster frame time is
that from a meld, hits and track files are achieved quicker (and so is
AAT/EID correlation).

Second, the faster frame time is optimum for maneuvering targets and
targets near the beam. Sort mode’s 30° azimuth scan provides one-half
the frame time of 60° RWS, for a given elevation bar setting. However,
frame time benefits of 30° azimuth scan are not realized if sort mode’s
mechanized 4-bar elevation scan is used. Four-bar sort provides about
20,000 feet of altitude coverage at 25 nm. If 10,000 feet of altitude
coverage is sufficient, manually input 2-bar and achieve the full benefits
of our 30° azimuth scan frame time. Sort does not use the dual sliding
window processing for determining target range. If using sort to break
out targets closely spaced in range, particularly at longer ranges, RWS
might be the better option.

Last, as with sorting from any other mode, use MED if the target is being
refreshed with MPRF. In INLV and a high aspect target, if the target is
being refreshed only on HPRF bars, the target will only be refreshed on
every other radar sweep (Figure D-20, left). If the target is being
refreshed on both MPRF and HPRF bars (Figure D-20, right), then use
MED for sorting because of its improved range resolution over HI.

TWS Sort

The target sorting capabilities of TWS can be enhanced by selecting the
TWS sort mode. The raw radar hit symbology is displayed under the TWS
symbology. Whenever the radar is in TWS, the “SORT” legend is
available at PB #9. The TWS sort capability is selected by boxing the
legend. While in TWS, the aircrew can select or deselect SORT as desired.
The last selection is maintained when TWS is exited and reentered. TWS
sort is compatible with other TWS logic (DTWS or NDTWS, and all TWS
scan patterns, including HDTWS). HOTAS switchology for selecting
TWS/HDTWS, TWS scan volumes, and designating/undesignated targets
generally follows normal TWS logic, but there are a couple of exceptions.
If the auto acquisition switch is moved aft in TWS, the normal logic is
entry into STT on the PDT or RPT. However, in TWS sort, the radar
enters miniraster at the acquisition symbol location, not STT. To enter
STT, the aircrew must place the acquisition symbol over the desired target
prior to moving the acquisition switch aft. The advantage is that the
aircrew can lock any TWS track file (not limited to the PDT in DTWS or
the RPT in NDTWS).

SUMMARY

The designers of the APG-70 provided numerous modes, each with its own
capabilities. All the modes have characteristics which provide both
advantages and disadvantages. An advantage in one situation may be a
disadvantage in another situation. Your ability to use the appropriate
modes at the appropriate times for appropriate situations, quickly and
efficiently, is the essence of effective tactical radar employment. As you
proceed through the academics on air-to-air weapons, air-to-air
maneuvering and air-to-air intercepts, you will build on your
understanding of how to employ the APG-70 and the wealth of
information it provides, so that you can effectively execute your mission.

INTRODUCTION

The F-15E’s APG-70 radar is one of its most useful and versatile
capabilities. After all, they once built a light gray aircraft, very similar in
appearance to the F-15E, just to carry the APG-70’s grandfather (the
APG-63). The APG-70 supports a myriad of capabilities:

Instrument trail departures and recoveries

Radar trail formations beyond visual ranges (like night low
levels)

Rendezvous with other aircraft, whether it be a wingman
rejoining with his leader, a tanker rendezvous for air refueling
or marshaling with a strike package

Distinguishing one aircraft from another (including friendly/
hostile aircraft via AAI/EID capabilities)

Monitoring air-to-air weapons parameters against an adversary
and the required information to position the F-15E to a desired
positional advantage and weapons employment zone (WEZ)

Provides information to A/A missiles, including (but not limited
to) location of the target

From the original APG-63 to the current APG-70, the F-15’s radar
capabilities and its flexibility have been continuously improved. As you
study the F-15E/APG-70, you will understand that the designers really
have mechanized the system so that you, the aviator, can achieve the
desired outcome for the tasks at hand.

RADAR TASKS AND RADAR MODES

The APG-70 has a variety of search, track and hybrid (search and track)
modes. The use of these modes (when and how) is both situation and
aircrew preference dependent. Figure D-1 suggests which modes are
appropriate for which tasks. The assignment of modes versus tasks is
certainly open to debate. For example highlight could easily be argued as
a sample or sanitize capability and high data rate track-while-scan
(HDTWS) could be argued as providing both sample and sort capabilities.
We will return to this matrix later. But first, consider some APG-70
mechanization factors that influence the strengths and weaknesses of the
various modes and how you can influence the modes.

Frame Time

Frame time determines how quickly the radar can gather information
about a target, process the information, declare the target, and then
refresh its understanding of the target. Frame time is determined by the
azimuth scan rate (mode dependent), azimuth scan width, and the
number of elevation bars. Generally, scan rate aside, the larger the
volume of airspace the radar searches, the longer the frame time.

Larger search volumes (longer frame time) must be used when target
location is unknown, or not well-known.

RDR-5 D-2


Text from RDR-5_Air-to-Air_Radar_Employment_page_9.jpeg:
When the target location is better defined (AAI/EID symbology, GCI
information, etc.) smaller search volumes can be used to provide quicker
target detections (and faster AAI/EID). For longer range targets
(particularly small radar cross section targets) modes which provide
slower scan rates (longer “dwell time”) may provide earlier target
detection. At close ranges, smaller search volumes and faster scan rates
increase the number of radar “hits” versus time so that the radar, and
aircrew, are more aware of target maneuvering. For breaking out
separate, closely spaced targets during sorting, small search volumes and
slow scan rates are beneficial, but the search volume and scan rate must
also accommodate possible target maneuvering. Figure D-2 shows frame
times considering radar modes (scan rates) and search volume (azimuth
scan and elevation bars).

The time the previous aircraft’s weapon frag is in the air can be found in
the Maximum Bomb/Rocket Fragment Travel Chart in TO 1-1M-34. This
gives the maximum time any generic piece of frag should be airborne.
Using the maximum bomb fragment travel chart, the time of flight of frag
for all types of MK-82s at 5000 feet TDA is 25.9 seconds (Figure D-3).

The time required for a ripple release is computed using the formula

(N - 1) X INT, where N is the total number of weapon release pulses
(number of weapons for ripple single releases, number of weapons divided
by how many stations to be released from for ripple multiple releases) in
the string of bombs, and INT is the interval (in seconds) between releases.
INT can be found (listed as Ripple Interval) in the CWDS printout
(Figure D-4), or the impact spacing factor tables in TO 1-1M-34. Using a
ripple single delivery with 28 foot impact spacing the ripple release time is
0.33 seconds (11 X 30 msec).

Thus, the total time deconfliction required for frag deconfliction is
computed by adding these times (6.46 + 25.9 + .33), resulting in the total
time of 32.69 seconds. In other words, 32.69 seconds is the minimum
required spacing between aircraft to ensure #2 has time deconfliction from
the lead aircraft’s frag pattern.

D-5 TAC-2


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_12.jpeg:
Advantages / Disadvantages

Deconflicting by time allows aircraft in the element to overfly the same
target at lower altitudes. However, spacing by time may degrade mutual
support because the time delay between deliveries allows the enemy to
prepare for subsequent attackers. For this reason, predictability should
be reduced by attacking from different axes whenever possible.

Altitude Deconfliction

To avoid the fragmentation pattern using altitude separation, following
aircraft must stay above the maximum altitude of the fragment envelope
of the preceding aircraft’s munitions. Using the same example,

Figure D-3 shows that 2500 feet is the minimum altitude in order to stay
above the frag for a MK-82 delivery on a target with a TDA of 5000 feet.

For a diving delivery, the following aircraft cannot descend below the top
of the frag envelope. Therefore, altitude lost during the ripple release
(found in TO 1-1M-34 or the CWDS program) plus the altitude lost during
pullout (from the CWDS program) must be added to the maximum
altitude for the fragment envelope to compute a minimum release altitude
(MRA). For example, let us compute the altitude deconfliction required for
a wingman to stay above the frag if the flight lead drops MK-82 low drag
general purpose (LDGP) bombs on a target and the wingman needs to
stay above lead’s frag as he drops 12 MK-82 LDGP bombs from a 20°
diving delivery at 500 KTAS on a target with a density altitude of 5000
feet, then executes a 5 G climbing safe escape maneuver. First, the frag
altitude for lead’s bombs can be found in the Maximum Bomb Fragment
Travel chart (Figure D-3). This chart shows the altitude of the frag to be
2500 feet. To this, we must add the altitude lost during ripple release of
285 feet from the CWDS printout in Figure D-5. In addition, we must add
the altitude lost during dive recovery value of 730 feet from the CWDS
printout in Figure D-6. By adding these values (2500 + 285 + 730), we
find that the wingman must release his bombs no lower than 3515 feet
AGL. Thus, a MRA of 3515 feet AGL allows the wingman to release all 12
bombs with the planned release interval and recover from the 20° dive
while staying above lead’s frag.

TAC-2 D-6


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_13.jpeg:
A much easier way to do this is to use the “min recovery/release” option on
the delivery page of CWDS. In the example above, you would input 2500'
(or pad it) as the “min recovery/release” altitude and CWDS will calculate
your release altitude. The altitude lost during ripple release and dive
recovery are included in the CWDS computed release altitude. In order to
provide for a safe margin of error, the MRA is usually calculated for 5°
steeper than planned dive angle. For a planned 20° delivery, the MRA
calculations and dive recovery numbers would be based on flying a 25°
dive. This provides a reasonable margin of error for being off planned

parameters.

Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_14.jpeg:
Advantages / Disadvantages

Using altitude as the only means of deconfliction allows aircraft in the
element to attack a target immediately after the preceding aircraft.
However, the increased altitude may increase exposure time and place the
trailing aircraft in the lethal envelope of additional enemy defense
systems as he maneuvers for the weapons delivery.

Horizontal Deconfliction

To avoid the fragmentation pattern using horizontal separation, trailing
aircraft must remain outside the maximum horizontal range of the
fragment envelope for the preceding attacker’s munitions. Figure D-3
shows that 2900 feet is the minimum separation required for a MK-82
delivery on a target with a TDA of 5000 feet. Horizontal spacing assumes
parallel flight paths. For converging attack axes, the trailing aircraft
must remain outside the horizontal frag pattern of lead’s bombs in all
directions.

Another consideration when releasing weapons from the outer CFT
stations is the F-15E CFT lateral displacement (how far the bomb is
ejected sideways from the outer CFT bomb racks). This is listed on the
CWDS printout (Figure D-9, page D-11). You should add this value to the
horizontal range of the frag from the Dash 34 chart. It is usually a small
value that is fairly insignificant, but is a good reason to “pad” the
deconfliction required by rounding up the value (if it is not directly
known). This only applies when bombs are ejected from the outer CFT
racks due to their angle and cant away from the jet.

Computing the horizontal deconfliction for cluster bomb units (CBUs) is
slightly different (Figure D-7). The horizontal separation must be equal to
or greater than the larger of the following:

e Maximum horizontal range of the fragment envelope for an
intact cluster.

e Sum of the CBU pattern half-width plus the maximum

horizontal range of the fragment envelope for the submunition
as shown in Figure D-7.

Advantages / Disadvantages

Using lateral spacing for deconfliction allows aircraft in the element to
attack two targets simultaneously. This type of spacing is most commonly
used against area targets or targets with different designated mean points
of impact (DMPIs). When attacking one target/DMPI, horizontal spacing
can be taken in the form of standoff deliveries such as loft or low altitude
toss (LAT) allowing simultaneous attacks.

Fingertip Formation

If time, altitude, or horizontal deconfliction cannot be achieved during
simultaneous formation deliveries on the same target/DMPI, then the
wingman must be in close (fingertip) formation. In this type of delivery,
fragment protection is provided by the safe escape minimum release
altitude.

WARNING

The wingman must not drop back to
any type of route or trail position
during formation deliveries; doing so
will significantly increase the
probability of fragmentation.

There is very little utility in this type of delivery since it requires a target
with no significant threats and ROE liberal enough to allow a fairly
inaccurate delivery.

Deconfliction Summary

Fragmentation deconfliction has become easier in recent years by more
effectively taking advantage of standoff capability, often made possible by
the use of precision guided weapons and/or the increased accuracy of
aircraft systems.

In summary, each type of deconfliction has advantages and
disadvantages. However, on most occasions a combination of deconfliction
types is used. This is particularly true in a large composite strike force
where overflying the target is required. Further, when employing a
precision guided (smart) weapon, deconfliction is easily achieved through
loft/LAT/medium altitude delivery profiles.

TAC-2 D-12


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_19.jpeg:
ATTACK PROFILES

Element attacks are normally done with two to four aircraft which are
part of a larger composite strike force. However, the focus of this section
is on the basic fighting unit (two-ship) element attacks. Element attacks
fall into one of three profiles: the split, echelon, and trail attacks. These
attack profiles can be performed as either sequential or simultaneous
attacks.

Split Attack

The split attack option is designed for minimum exposure while splitting
the defenses. Sequential split attacks are achieved through time spacing.
However, other types of deconfliction can be used.

For time deconfliction, the second aircraft achieves separation by
traversing a greater distance over the ground. For example, at a
predetermined action point one aircraft turns either across or away from
the other element member and away from the target. After the planned
spacing is achieved, the aircraft turns back toward the target

(Figure D-10). This allows both aircraft to ingress, deliver their weapons,
and egress at lower altitudes.

Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_20.jpeg:
Against an area target, lateral separation enables you to accomplish a
simultaneous split attack. The attack sequence from the split point to the
egress point must be separated either laterally or vertically when used
against single DMPIs. Frag deconfliction can be obtained through
altitude (single DMPI) or by horizontally deconflicting the frag envelope
for separate DMPIs as shown in Figure D-11.

TAC-02-11

Figure D - 11. Simultaneous Split Attack.
Some advantages of the split attack are:

e It provides minimum exposure time in the target area.

e It splits the defenses and complicates their targeting plan.
Some disadvantages of the split attack are:

e Once the split occurs visual mutual support may be degraded.

e  Ifone fighter is engaged the other may not be able to bring
ordnance to bear on the attacker until after weapon release.

TAC-2 D-14


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_21.jpeg:
e Because of crossing angles, regaining mutual support when
egressing might be more difficult.

e If timing deconfliction is used, the first attack will alert the
defenses to follow-on attacks.

Echelon Attack

An echelon attack option is designed for maximizing mutual support and
the number of aircraft across the target in the least amount of time
(Figure D-12). For example, at a predetermined point, both aircraft turn
away from the target for angle-off pops. When lead turns back toward the
target, two follows. If a sequential echelon attack is desired, then the
tactical separation is maintained. If a simultaneous echelon attack is
desired, then the tactical separation is decreased. When lead turns back
toward the target, two can turn to the same target/DMPI, or to another
target/DMPI. If lateral separation is inadequate for frag clearance, then
the following aircraft can recover at a higher altitude than the lead
aircraft’s fragmentation, or use a standoff delivery to remain outside the
frag envelope.

Figure D - 12. Echelon Attack.

D-15 TAC-2


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_22.jpeg:
A simultaneous loft is one form of an echelon attack. Here, both aircraft
maintain tactical formation with the wingman slightly aft of line abreast
(approximately 15-30° aft) until approximately 10 seconds TPULL. The
wingman then turns to center the attack steering and executes the loft
delivery simultaneously with, or just behind, his leader. In this situation,
it is important that #2 does not get ahead of his leader or pull off in such a
way as to cross the flight path of lead’s ordnance. Also, the recovery
should be planned away from the wingman so lead will not have a
deconfliction problem with the wingman’s ordnance. Plan and fly the
recovery to ensure aircraft and munition deconfliction, to include the other
aircraft’s munitions if performing simultaneous deliveries.

Some advantages of echelon attacks are:
e Good visual support throughout the attack with good 6 o’clock
coverage for lead. However, the wingman’s 6 o’clock coverage is

degraded.

e  Itis easier for the wingman, since he flies visual formation off
lead which reduces his navigation requirements.

e The proximity of the two aircraft to each other decreases their
time in the target area and simplifies the egress geometry.

Some disadvantages of echelon attacks are:

e The proximity of the aircraft in the element makes it easier for
the enemy defenses to locate and engage both aircraft.

e AAAor SAM aimed at one aircraft may hit the other aircraft.

Trail Attack

The trail attack option may be useful when it is necessary to have both
aircraft overfly the target on the same axis with time deconfliction. This
may be driven by weather, terrain, target type, threat, or ordnance being
delivered. There are many ways of attaining this trail interval. One way
is for the following aircraft to execute an x number of degrees turn away
from lead and hold that heading for a preplanned number of seconds.
After the time has expired the following aircraft reverses back to course,
falling into trail. The delay prior to the reverse is driven by the desired
trail interval. Figure D-13 is an example of deploying to trail for
sequential level deliveries.

Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_24.jpeg:
Some advantages of the trail attack are:

Each aircraft’s maneuverability is maximized.

It provides an excellent SAM lookout as the second aircraft can
stay low and check for SAMs while the first aircraft is over the
target area.

On a hard-to-find target, the leader may be able to direct the
wingman’s eyes to the target or give a correction off his bombs.

Some disadvantages of the trail attack are:

TAC-2

It provides no visual mutual support for the second aircraft
during most of the attack.

The attacking aircraft may be in the target area for an extended
period of time, allowing gunners a longer time to acquire and
target the trailing aircraft. Attacking from the same axis also
makes acquisition of the trailing aircraft easier.

The lead aircraft’s bomb alerts the defenses increasing the
threats in the target area for the trailers.

SOLVING FOR DECONFLICTION

GIVEN: Number of aircraft - 2 F-15Es
Munitions - 4 MK-84 AITRs, FMU-139 4 sec arm
Delivery - level, 550 KTAS, 500 feet AGL, 100 msec spacing,
ripple multiple
2500 target density altitude (TDA)

Time Deconfliction

As mentioned earlier, time spacing required between two aircraft is based
upon the delivery TOF, the time required for a ripple release, and how
long the previous aircraft’s weapon frag is in the air. The amount of
separation, in a trail attack for example, must be equal to or greater than
the added values.

For this example, a level delivery of 4 MK-84 AIR (HD) at 550 KTAS and
500 feet AGL has a TOF of 5.89 seconds (Figure D-14). With an impact

spacing of 100 msec, the ripple release time is 0.10 seconds (100 msec X 1).

The 1 in this equation results from (N - 1) where N is the number of
release pulses (2 for ripple multiple of 4 weapons).

ELEMENT ATTACKS
Introduction

There are several reasons for accomplishing an element attack. One is to
provide mutual support against enemy defenses such as SAMs, AAA, and
Als. Second, element attacks allow compressed TOTs which reduce time
spent in the target area and/or near the threat. Third, maneuvering
elements employing various countermeasures complicate or disrupt the
enemy’s targeting plan, thereby delaying or denying engagement.
Element attacks enhance survivability; however, fragmentation
deconfliction must be planned.

FRAG DECONFLICTION

For a single aircraft attacking a target, frag deconfliction is provided by
the safe escape/separation planning charts and tables located in

TO 1-1M-34 and the tables option in CWDS planning software for specific
weapons and release conditions. Flying the depicted safe escape
maneuver provides protection for a one-in-a-thousand chance of being
struck by your own frag when releasing at the minimum release altitude.
When attacking as elements (and target overflight is required) the trailing
aircraft must be concerned not only with his own frag, but also with the
leading aircraft’s frag. Therefore, plan the attack so trailing aircraft avoid
the frag pattern for the required time, altitude, and/or horizontal distance.

TAC-2


Text from TAC-2_Element_Attacks_page_8.jpeg:
Figure D-1 depicts the frag pattern of a MK-82 general purpose (GP)
bomb. Given a target density altitude (TDA) of 5000 feet, the frag pattern
for a MK-82 remains a factor for 25.9 seconds, with a height of 2500 feet
and a 2900 foot radius. This information comes from the Maximum
Bomb/Rocket Fragment Travel Chart found in TO 1-1M-34, Chapter 6, a
portion of which is depicted in Figure D-3 on page D-4. The chart provides
information for both sea level and 5000 foot density altitudes (DAs).
Values may be interpolated or extrapolated to 10,000 foot DAs. The frag
pattern can be visualized as a cylinder and must be considered full of frag
for the entire frag time of flight (taken from the Dash 34 chart or CWDS
program) to ensure deconfliction.

Time Deconfliction

Time spacing required between two aircraft is based upon the delivery
time of fall (TOF) and how long the previous aircraft’s weapon frag is in
the air. The amount of separation must be equal to or greater than the
added values. In addition, if a ripple release is used, the time required for
all of the weapons to be released from the aircraft must be included.

Text from TAC-5_Mission_Planning_page_10.jpeg:
TARGET AREA PLANNING

Since the target is the focal point of the mission, working from the target
backward is the normal planning priority. Once a target is determined,
the following information needs to be collected.

Target Study Materials

A unit intelligence target specialist should be relied upon to get you the
best available information about your target. Figure D-1, for example,
shows an aim point graphic that contains WGS-84 coordinates (i.e., what
your INS uses), an overhead photo, a 1/250,000 and 1/50,000 scale map of
the aim point and its elevation.

Although HHQ (higher headquarters) and local planning staffs should
crosscheck the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) for target
and ordnance compatibility, do a simple logic test yourself. Going to the
target with the best available ordnance load the first time may reduce the
need to return a second time.

Target orientation is also important in some cases. Your ordnance may
dictate running down a runway rather than across it, for example. The
time of day, visual ID requirements, and surrounding terrain all play
some part in determining your attack profile.

Time of day and attack axis can significantly alter the IR characteristics

of the target area. This must be considered when planning attacks that
require an IR sensor for delivery or guidance.

Threats

While evaluating target orientation, consider terminal threats which, if
known, may be avoided with sufficient planning. If the terminal area
threats cannot be avoided or suppressed, they will dictate the use of
minimum exposure tactics, attack ingress and egress axis, and altitudes.

Attack Axis Selection

The threat and target-ordnance compatibility will dictate your attack axis.
If not, choose an approach to the target that best suits your delivery. For
example, if a long range loft delivery is the option of choice using radar or
laser ranging, you need to ensure that you have unobstructed line-of-sight
to the target in sufficient time to get valid ranging. An attack axis that
places terrain between you and the target during the delivery can produce
ranging errors that could cause excessive miss distances. For planned
visual deliveries, choose significant visual update points that allow you to
work big to small and lead you to the target.

For LGB deliveries choose an attack axis that will give line of sight to the
target for prerelease acquisition and throughout the planned designation
maneuver. Run-in heading or designation maneuver may have to be
altered to reduce podium affect for LGB guidance.

Weather

Target area weather can be a main determinant of how you plan your
attack. A low ceiling generally denies visual diving deliveries. If not
planned for, bad weather can directly affect mission success.

When coordinating with the forecasters, determine the expected ceiling,
visibility, freezing level, winds, target area altimeter setting, contrail
level, transmissivity and note other hazards. For sequential visual or IR
attacks, plan so that the smoke from the bomb explosion of the first
aircraft does not obscure the target area for following aircraft. This may
be complicated by the effects of wind. Develop a plan but be flexible
enough to adjust to the conditions actually encountered.

Sun azimuth and elevation can be used to your advantage. Attacking or
egressing using the sun can degrade enemy IR systems in the target area

and make you more difficult to acquire visually.

By the same token the sun can also degrade your ability to find the target,
particularly in low sun angle conditions. Pull-ups for loft and diving

TAC-5 D-6


Text from TAC-5_Mission_Planning_page_13.jpeg:
deliveries can also be a problem when running toward the sun. The HUD
presentation can, at times, be totally washed out.

Planned Ordnance

When fragged with unfamiliar ordnance or fuzes, make a thorough review
of preflight requirements in TO 1-1M-34 and TO 1F-15E-34-1-1. Set the
applicable laser code, ECM setting, spin rate, etc. Review the applicable
carriage, employment, and jettison limits contained in Chapter 5 of the
Dash 1. If JMEMs or experience tells you another munition would be
more effective, coordinate to change the fragged ordnance.

Frag Deconfliction

For element attacks you have to plan for frag deconfliction between
members of the flight. The basic approaches are to use time, altitude or
horizontal methods. Refer to TAC-2 and TO 1-1M-34 for a detailed
discussion. Specific safe escape maneuvers are found in TO
1F-15E-34-1-3. Escape maneuver execution should be briefed for each
delivery.

Attack Profile Selection

Attack profiles are chosen to survive the threat and achieve the required
accuracy and weapon effects. Level and diving deliveries require target
overflight and provide the crew the most time to correct for navigational
errors. The major problem is that a “show” target is normally required.
Terminal area threats, however, may dictate the use of standoff deliveries.
Low altitude toss (sensor designated or visual) and loft deliveries provide
some degree of standoff.

Once the profile is decided, an immediate reattack option should be
planned to deal with system degrades or threat reactions.

The reattack plan must be coordinated to provide deconfliction from other
aircraft in the strike package. This may mean flowing out of the target
area and reattacking during an alternate TOT, or a reattack within the
original TOT window. Time constraints imposed by support assets may
also alter/affect the reattack plan. You must ensure SEAD and other
support assets critical for success have the fuel/weapons to stay on station
for a reattack.

D-7 TAC-5


Text from TAC-5_Mission_Planning_page_14.jpeg:
Delivery Computations

Auto deliveries allow flexibility but ballistic computations still need to be
done to ensure that fuze arming and safe escape requirements are met.
Take the time to plan a manual back-up in the event of CC failure. TO
1-1M-34, TO 1F-15E-34-1-8, and/or the CWDS program are required for
this. The need to default to a back-up delivery may cause a change in the
ingress flow to the target.

Delivery

Use target study to develop the best attack axis and desired delivery type.
With this information, work backwards from the target to an initial point
(IP). Look for a routing that makes maximum use of the terrain for
masking and navigation updating. Since most targets worth hitting will
be defended and/or camouflaged you may need to use terrain and cultural
features to funnel yourself to find the target. Having a good idea of the
big things around the target enhances visual search and helps to acquire
the target in time to employ ordnance. For system auto and loft deliveries
the same planning discipline helps you to verify the designation prior to
the pull.

Sensor Integration

Sensor integration requires adequate preflight planning. Planning for the
air-to-ground radar and TGT IR is discussed in detail in a separate Sensor
Planning lesson. The considerations addressed there apply in the target
area as well.

Targeting IR planning begins with your inputs to the forecaster. The
Tactical Decision Aid (TDA) they supply will allow you to plan when to
take action and at what range to expect to have usable video. The second
requirement is to attain line-of-sight with the target or offset.

Real beam map (RBM) is also a viable alternative if it is properly planned.
If nothing else, have an idea of what the scope should look like prior to
commanding an HRM map. Targeting can also be accomplished using
RBM. The switch actions and flow are identical to HRM, but radar scope
interpretation is much more difficult.

TAC-5 D-8


Text from TAC-5_Mission_Planning_page_15.jpeg:
Target Designations

With proper planning you will get airborne with a NAV designation at a
minimum. To enhance designation accuracy, update the system at some
point prior to the target (the closer the better). With a tight INS, a
mission nav reset prior to the attack run may provide sufficient accuracy
for visual deliveries.

The procedures and planning considerations involved in getting a radar
designation were discussed in detail in A/G radar academics. To reduce
the errors induced by coordinate transformations, try to map target direct
whenever possible. Update the MN and then designate.

In determining the type of designation, always start with the most
accurate as the primary option. You should default down the hierarchy
only as required to handle system degradation, or to counter the threat.

In a composite threat environment, a good rule of thumb is to
update/designate early and often. This keeps you from missing the
planned opportunity due to threat reactions, degraded systems or switch
errors. Do not forget to evaluate and, if necessary, to update system
altitude. It is a vital component of the bombing equation and sensor
cueing.

NAV FLIR

If the navigation pod is loaded it can be used to see through some of the
smoke and dust that may be present in the target area. The FLIR may
not be used alone. Night/low altitude deliveries will normally use the TF
system. A nav pod boresight in this case is extremely important if a visual
delivery is planned.

Finalizing the Plan

Once the routing from the IP to the target is decided, start developing the
big picture of where all the other known players will be during the ingress
and egress. Within your formation, know where each flight member will
be throughout the attack flow and be attentive to where conflicts may
develop. The biggest problem is frag deconfliction. Review the plan in
detail to be sure that minor deviations do not cause unacceptable risk.

Attack Schematic

Now the ideas of how to get into and out of the target area need to be put
down on paper. In this case an attack schematic or stick diagram is a
useful tool. As seen in Figure D-2, show the intended route of flight,
emphasize significant terrain or cultural features, and show how the
formation flows out of the target. Placing the diagram on a 1:50,000 scale
chart works well, but at times the extensive detail can be distracting.
Techniques for putting additional information on the schematic vary. For
illustrative purposes, heading and distance from the IP to a pull-up-point
are included. Do not forget to include INS data on your schematic. With a
good update/designation, distance and heading information is extremely
accurate. This will help save the delivery when you have to jink for
threats and use a different attack axis. The final attack heading and
ballistic parameters are also available. The egress flow takes into
consideration each frag pattern, and a bugout heading to a clear area is
the first heading on the egress.

EN ROUTE NAVIGATION

Route of flight may be dictated in the ATO. If not, the choice of routing
should consider circumnavigating the threat, if fuel permits. Also look at
the intelligence situation and pick a routing that minimizes exposure. If
support assets like jammers or HARM platforms are working in a specific
area, approaching near their sector may be beneficial. Again, threats and
fuel are the biggest determinants in route selection.

Steer points along the route should be visually significant to aid in
navigation and system updates. Remember when choosing steer points or
a route of flight that a good visual point (e.g. bridge or major intersection)
may be heavily defended. A harder to identify but less heavily defended
point may be better. Work with intelligence to get the best possible
coordinate information for aim points and offsets along the route. Plan
several offsets/aim points on the friendly side of the forward edge of the
battle area (FEBA). Once in enemy territory, you may not have a chance
for another update. However, additional offsets/aim points should be
planned, and used if threats allow. When approaching the target area,
you want your system as accurate as possible.

Fuel Planning

Fuel planning, using manual charts from the TO 1-F-15E-1-1 or AFMSS,
has to include all expected dashes in the target area, crossing the FEBA,
and maneuvering defensive reactions. If carrying external tanks, decide
on a feed plan that allows survival. In a dense air threat environment,
you may consider feeding CFT fuel prior to external tank fuel to be able to
reduce gross weight quickly if defensively engaged. Make sure you always
plan enough to get to a divert base.

Remember that fuel planning is directly affected by your choice of altitude
and speed. Go only as low and only as fast as required. An immediate
transition from takeoff to 300 feet for a 250-mile trip to the FEBA is
probably not tactically required or prudent from a planning perspective.

Joker and Bingo fuel planning should be based on a best case, and a
HUNG ordnance worst case. Theater rules will dictate minimum fuel
requirements for recovery. Plan ahead for fuel divert fields and do not
press the issue; divert early and avoid the rush.

Rule of thumb: Use 2000-2500 lbs/min for AB.

TAC-5 D-12


Text from TAC-5_Mission_Planning_page_19.jpeg:
Formation Selection

The formation chosen is most influenced by the threat. Weather, terrain
and aircraft/crew capabilities will also influence the type of formation.
While going from one formation to another ensure the radar and visual
search responsibilities are commensurate with the threat. Radar sorting
plans may also need to be modified. See AFTTP 3-1, Volume XVII and
AFTTP 3-3, Volume XVII for more detail.

If running nonvisual parallel tracks with another aircraft or element, be
very specific about deconfliction rules and sort/commit criteria. Parallel
tracks work well when attempting to push a large number of aircraft
through an area simultaneously. This has application when attempting to
saturate the defenses but more so when taking advantage of suppression
efforts that have short influence times.

Low Altitude Considerations
Terrain

To help reduce the chances of being visually acquired, attempt to fly over
roughly textured terrain to break up the aircraft's shadow. Flying in the
shadow of a cloud or mountain can also help. When given the option, fly
around any body of water, dry lake bed, open field, or similar areas. They
provide easy line-of-sight and good fields of fire. Climbing to diffuse your
shadow over this type of feature may require an altitude of 4000-5000 feet
and is probably not tactically sound.

Avoid flying along lines of communication like highways, canals, rail lines,
power lines, etc. This applies on either side of the FEBA. On our side of
the FEBA you are relying on being rapidly identified as a friendly. This
may not occur. You may also be flying across the enemy's target area.
Cross these areas as close to 90° as possible to minimize exposure. Always
be prepared to defend yourself.

Altitude and Airspeed

Go only as low and only as fast as dictated by the tactical situation. Use
420 KCAS as an operational minimum at low altitude. Maximum speed is
determined by stores, systems (TF), ROE, other aircraft in the package or
basic aircraft limit. Use speed to compensate for timing to meet a TOT.
Planning a route correction (turning short or extending a turn point)
eliminates dramatic power changes. Techniques vary, but use of
command ground speed or ETA on the Data 1/2 page are the most
common.

FEBA/FLOT/FSCL Crossing

Front line defenses both on the ingress and egress have to be dealt with.
Conditions permitting, high altitude overflight of short range air defenses
is preferred. If this is not possible, a low level penetration option needs to
be planned. First, visually supportive formations should be used to
provide warning of short range stern engagements. AN/ALE 45
programming should be planned based on the expected threat, but use
should be driven by observed threats. AFTTP 3-1, Vol II contains a good
discussion of reactive and preemptive defensive maneuvering reactions for
both AAA and short range missile engagements. Review that section and
incorporate the appropriate reactions in your training scenarios.

Plan to cross the FEBA where there are minimal to no threats. The
enemy cannot be everywhere. When approaching the FEBA, align to cross
perpendicular if possible. This limits exposure by providing the shortest
path into the rear area. This desire needs to be tempered with some
judgment. A more oblique routing over terrain that is unaccessible to
ground forces may be a better option.

Prior to FEBA crossing, EMCON becomes a real factor in limiting the
enemy's engagement capability. Whether EMIS LIMIT or selective
shutdown of emitters is used, deny passive detection if able. If the enemy
uses passive detection to orient air defenses the first indication of
detection may be a missile in the air.

Threat Reaction

The first rule is to avoid the threat. Plan formations and route of flight to
optimize radar and visual search. Offset any known surface threat or
enemy CAP obtained in the pre-mission intelligence briefing. If engaged
en route, strive to maintain element integrity. When engaged by a surface
threat, establishing a flow away from the threat and toward the next steer
point will keep you from anchoring in a high density surface threat
environment. Under certain circumstances your ordnance can be used in
self-defense, such as in a bomb-in-face (BIF) maneuver.

Strip criteria and element threat reactions need to be briefed in detail and
a rejoin flow established to maintain/regain mutual support.

TAC-5 D-14


Text from TAC-5_Mission_Planning_page_21.jpeg:
Commit criteria for air threats need to be delineated. When tasked
air-to-surface, remember that the mission is bombs on target, on time, not
to become Ace of the Base. Engaging a threat may highlight you if the
bandit did not know you were there. Engage threats that will prevent you
from accomplishing your mission. Normally a commit range/alt is briefed
to help determine which air-to-air threats to engage. For instance you
might commit on all bandits within 20 nm or 10,000’ of your formation if
you believe the bandits are aware of your position. Bandit aspect angle,
bandit maneuvers and RWR may help you determine if the bandits are
“aware.” Establish a jettison plan that enhances defensive maneuvering
potential but retains some air-to-surface capability, if possible. The
jettison decision is an important one. Jettisoning early makes the bandit's
mission a success if you did not take out the target. As a rule of thumb, if
a turn of more than 180° is needed and you are still defensively engaged,
your BFM skills are now most important to the war effort. If your threat
reaction takes you below 400 kts and you are still defensive, now would be
a good time to jettison your ordnance to maintain airspeed.

Route Plan
Figure D-3 is an example of a basic route plan diagram consisting of steer

points, significant geographical landmarks, timing requirements and
major tasks to perform.

Actual clock times of arrival at each steer point can be computed by
current flight planning programs. This allows you to plan ahead for
timing corrections.

Speed corrections, like push-it-up points, should be clearly annotated.
Individual route leg MEAs can be life saving when dealing with
unexpected weather or equipment failures especially during TF ops.
Frequency changes, altitude restrictions, EMCON plan, and search and
formation position changes can also be annotated to get the entire plan in
graphic form. Another technique for managing this wealth of information
is to annotate it on the low level route book where it should occur (Figure
D-4). Be careful not to put too much information on your route diagram or
it may become cluttered and difficult to read, and act more as a hindrance
than a help.

RTB

Once you have expended your ordnance, you are only halfway done; so the
route study used in getting to the target applies to the recovery as well.
Additional considerations include unexpended/hung ordnance, fuels and
procedures, divert fields, safe areas, jettison, dump targets, safe passage
procedures, etc. Threats along the egress flow are just as dangerous as
ingress threats, and you also may have to face your own approaching
forces at high speed and low altitude.

GROUND OPS

It is just as important to plan for ground operations as it is to plan for
airborne ops. Poor ground ops can easily make a mission go awry.
Ordnance loads and the rest of the aircraft configuration must be
confirmed with maintenance. Check with maintenance to ensure that the
proper fuzing is used and that all settings are correct. This may be done
by the squadron supervisor or “ramp rat” but coordination should be done
with these individuals to ensure the aircraft and munitions are as
planned. Additionally, these individuals should have the parking spot
locations to aid in establishing a taxi and arming flow. Do not wait until
arriving at the aircraft because there will not be enough time to correct
the load. If a comm-out launch is planned, confirm key visual signals with
the maintenance super, along with the rest of the flight and ground/tower.
Know the taxi plan. Getting 24 jets to the active runway is a lot like a
ballet. Everyone has to be in the right place at the right time.

CONTINGENCIES
Go/No-Go Decisions

Certain abort decisions will be made for you. Some will be based on
systems and others on circumstances. Each unit normally operates with
an established minimum essential system list (MESL). If certain systems
are inoperative, the aircraft is not mission capable and you would not
expose it and yourself to needless attrition. Realize also that a
Commander's judgement may also come into play. He may be forced by
the importance of the mission to send you anyway. That is why they call
it war.

D-19 TAC-5


Text from TAC-5_Mission_Planning_page_26.jpeg:
Weather

The actual weather encountered en route and in the target area may vary
significantly from the forecast. This may affect both en route navigation
and the attack phase. Deliveries both above and below the weather
should be considered, depending on the threat.

Checks

System and fence checks need to be accomplished as early as possible in
the mission to be able to lead turn problems that may affect the primary
plan.

Losses

The mission may be aborted due to the loss of certain planned support
assets. Examples here may be SEAD assets, jammers, AWACs, etc.
Package and mission commanders should develop a minimum go package
configuration during planning.

IFF Procedures

IFF phasing and Mode 4 use need incorporation into flight planning. At
the same time, AAI mode changes are also required to help distinguish
friend from foe.

Departure and Recovery

Be prepared to defend yourself during the departure and recovery phases
of the mission. Flare-only on the CMD may be a prudent action in the
vicinity of the airfield. Attempt to use comm out procedures to the
maximum extent possible.

While on the ground, avoid staggered taxi at close intervals that would
make the flight a lucrative target. If conditions allow, arm and de-arm in
dispersal locations. Taxi should be single-ship straight to takeoff or back
to park as appropriate.

In the peacetime environment, throttle back a bit and take the required
time in arming and de-arming.

TAC-5 D - 20


Text from TAC-5_Mission_Planning_page_27.jpeg:
Battle Damage

The immediate priority after sustaining battle damage is to determine the
airworthiness of the aircraft. If able to remain airborne, put a safe area or
recovery base on the nose and monitor fuel status. Coordinate crew
ejection procedures.

Escort

The desire to escort a damaged aircraft needs to be balanced against the
risk of exposing that aircraft and yourself to detection by surface and
airborne threats. If close escort is planned, there are three simple options.
The first is a simple weave behind or offset from the damaged aircraft.
This pattern enhances visual lookout to 6 o’clock but can dramatically
increase fuel consumption if heavy maneuvering is required to maintain
sight. It can also highlight the damaged aircraft position. A second option
is a moving racetrack pattern. This allows flying longer legs straight and
level. It also points the radar to the damaged aircraft’s six for longer
range detection of enemy air. The disadvantage is that you may not be in
a position to immediately employ ordnance in defense of the escorted
aircraft. Fuel consumption may become a factor in continuing the escort.
Attempts to close escort in a dense surface threat environment may not be
prudent. The third option is to call AWACS or any F-15Cs in the package
and have them provide air escort to the damaged aircraft. This may
require some time and extensive radio coordination.

Rescue Operations (RESCAP)

Reaction to the downing of a comrade has to be tempered by the tactical
situation. In a densely defended target area, marking their position and
passing that information up channel may be the only option. On the
friendly side of the FEBA you may be able to establish a CAP over their
position and coordinate recovery efforts. If an air threat is still a
consideration, CAP at tactically appropriate airspeeds and set the bingo
fuel based on recovery at a suitable airfield.

INTRODUCTION

This course is designed to provide you with one approach to consolidating
information provided throughout the academic program, and applying it to
a specific mission, SAT-3.

Air Tasking Order (ATO)

The ATO is the vehicle by which an air component commander
communicates specific tasks to subordinate units. The format and actual
flow of the ATO vary with theater of operations and level of effort
involved.

In general, an ATO outlines air component efforts over a 24 hour period.
The ATO (also called a Frag) contains, at a minimum, the following

information:

Current Tactical Situation

This brief provides a general commander’s assessment of how well allied
efforts have achieved their objectives.

Air Component Objectives

This covers how forces have been allocated to different missions. It also
addresses where the main effort (which consists of CAS, OCA, DCA,
SEAD, interdiction, recce and airlift) will occur.

Rules of Engagement (ROE)

ROE can most easily be thought of as restrictions. They are generally
used to limit the scope of the conflict or collateral damage. ROE existed
during the Korean, Vietnam and Southwest Asian Wars. Failure to
comply with established ROE is normally punishable under the UCMJ.

In addition to specific mission ROE, each theater of operations normally
has a set of standing rules that you need to know and abide by. These
rules are outlined in applicable flying regulations and directives.
“Training Rules” are briefed prior to every flight in the FTU.

D-1 TAC-5


Text from TAC-5_Mission_Planning_page_8.jpeg:
Specific Unit Tasking

Unit tasking is normally by mission type. For an interdiction mission, you
are assigned a mission number, call sign, the number of aircraft in the
mission, time on target (TOT), the target location, IFF codes, a standard
conventional load (SCL) and remarks to include tanker, suppression of
enemy air defenses (SEAD), OCA CAP and AWACS support.
Coordination requirements are normally included as remarks following
specific tasking. Once you locate your tasking you can scan the ATO to
determine what other assets are tasked in the same area. Also see if the
same target area is assigned to another unit to get a feel for the planned
flow in the target area. Look for tasked targets along your ingress and
egress routing to avoid overflight of an active target site.

Airspace Division

An airspace coordination order (ACO) is normally included in the ATO.
The ACO defines tanker tracks, special use airspace (i.e., AWACS orbits),
special routing and geographical areas of responsibility. It establishes
safe passage procedures that limit the potential of being engaged by
friendly defenses en route to or from the target. The ACO may dictate
specific routes or altitudes to be flown or use such discriminators as
airspeed, IFF, formation size, etc.

Compliance with safe passage procedures does not ensure safety. Be alert
at all times and be prepared to defend yourself from takeoff to landing.

Command, Control and Communications (C*)

This section establishes a frequency deconfliction plan for the force.
Frequencies are allocated for each portion of the effort. COMSEC needs to
be considered and discussed when operating on unsecure nets.

This C’ section also contains any codewords to be used during the period
of the ATO. Other information such as bullseye points, authenticators,
and SAR information may also be included.

The ROE, Communications plan and IFF information is usually in the
Special Instructions (SPINs) section of the ATO. The SPINs are usually
organized by the time period covered by the instructions. Permanent,
monthly and weekly SPINs are most common. Sometimes daily SPINs
are also included.

TAC-5 D-2


Text from TAC-5_Mission_Planning_page_9.jpeg:
Mission Planning Responsibilities

Once your flight has received its tasking, it is important to have a plan for
dividing up planning responsibilities. Although not all inclusive, the
following is a list of areas that need thorough planning:

Breaking the frag (ATO)
Target area

En route navigation
Ground ops
Contingencies

Mission data

This workbook outlines these planning areas.

Mission planning requirements vary greatly between units based on
directed operational capability (DOC) statements, geographic differences,
and sensor and weapon capabilities. The aircrew must be able to predict
what will be useful and when to devote attention to the task of identifying
a particular point.

It is vitally important that all personnel involved in mission planning
coordinate with each other. There is nothing worse than showing up at
brief time with three different IPs, two weapons loads, one cup of coffee
and no clue.

Frag Breaking

Getting the required information out of the frag is extremely important.
It may be best to have two people break the frag out separately, then
compare results to make sure there are no mistakes or omissions. If you
take the time to carefully examine the ATO, you can develop a big picture
of where all players will be during different phases of your flight.
Although certain support assets, such as jammers, may not be specifically
tasked to support your mission, you may have the flexibility to route your
flight to take advantage of their capabilities. No mission planning can
begin until all the information is extracted from the frag.
